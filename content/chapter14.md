**274** DSM-5 Guidebook

DSM-5 includes separate chapters for sexual dysfunctions,
gender dysphoria, and paraphilic disorders. _Sexual dysfunctions_ are disorders charac-
terized by a disturbance in a person’s ability to respond sexually or to experience sex-
ual pleasure. _Gender dysphoria_ refers to a person’s affective/cognitive discontent with
the assigned gender. _Paraphilic disorders_ involve sexual preferences other than genital
stimulation or preparatory fondling. DSM classification of these disorders has varied
over the years, reflecting the growing knowledge about the disorders as well as the
greater concern that individuals, clinicians, and researchers have about them.
Sexual dysfunctions were first recognized in DSM-II within the diagnosis “psycho-
physiologic genito-urinary disorder,” which included problems such as “disturbances
of menstruation and micturition, dyspareunia, and impotence in which emotional fac-
tors play a causative role” (p. 47). Their attribution to “emotional factors” reflected the
thinking at the time, which minimized the role of a physical etiology for these disorders.
In DSM-III, sexual dysfunctions came into their own and were placed in the umbrella
chapter “Psychosexual Disorders,” which also included gender identity disorders and
paraphilias.
Whereas the gender identity disorders were first recognized in DSM-III, paraphil-
ias were first listed in DSM-I under “sexual deviation,” a subcategory of sociopathic
personality disturbance. DSM-I stated the following: “This diagnosis is reserved for
deviant sexuality which is not symptomatic of more extensive syndromes, such as
schizophrenic and obsessional reactions. The term includes most of the cases formerly
classified as ‘psychopathic personality with pathologic sexuality.’ The diagnosis will
specify the type of the pathologic behavior, such as homosexuality, transvestism, pe-
dophilia, fetishism and sexual sadism (including rape, sexual assault, mutilation)”
(pp. 38–39).
In DSM-II, the paraphilias continued to be grouped within the category of person-
ality disorders and certain other nonpsychotic mental disorders, but a more complete
listing of sexual deviations was created that resembles the current classification, with
the exception of homosexuality, which was deleted from DSM in 1973 by vote of the
American Psychiatric Association (APA) Board of Trustees. DSM-III introduced oper-
ational diagnostic criteria for the paraphilias and included ego-dystonic homosexual-
ity under the subcategory of other psychosexual disorders. It was finally deleted from
DSM-III-R, although “persistent and marked distress” about one’s sexual orientation
continued in DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and DSM-IV-TR as an example of a sexual disorder
not otherwise specified. This concern is no longer acknowledged in DSM-5, reflecting
the evolving views of the psychiatric field and society at large.
During DSM-5 deliberations, there was some controversy about the possibility of
including hypersexual disorder, which is characterized by sexual behavior that is ex-
cessive or poorly controlled (commonly referred to as either “sex addiction” or “com-
pulsive sexual behavior”), and paraphilic coercive disorder, which consists of a
sexual preference for coerced sexual activity (i.e., rape). After considerable discussion
and input from fellow APA members, the decision was made not to include these dis-
orders in DSM-5.
Sexual dysfunctions, gender dysphoria, and paraphilic disorders will be dis-
cussed in turn, beginning with the sexual dysfunctions.

SEXUAL DYSFUNCTIONS

Sexual dysfunction involves either a disturbance in the processes that characterize the
sexual response cycle or pain or discomfort associated with sexual intercourse (see
list of disorders in Table 14–1). Epidemiological data suggest that sexual dysfunctions
are frequent and occur in 10%–30% of adults. Especially common are premature
(early) ejaculation, female orgasmic disorder, and erectile disorder. The sexual re-
sponse cycle has four phases—sexual excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.

**TABLE 14–1. DSM-5 sexual dysfunctions**

Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder

```
The first phase, _sexual excitement,_ consists of muscle tension, changes in breathing
and heart rate, swelling of the genitals, and vaginal lubrication. This phase may last
from a few minutes to a few hours. The second phase, the _plateau_ phase, intensifies
the feelings of the first phase and extends to the point of orgasm. The physiological
responses during the plateau phase become more intense. Several DSM-5 disorders
correspond to these first two phases. These include male hypoactive sexual desire dis-
order, female sexual interest/arousal disorder, and erectile disorder. Several changes
have been made for DSM-5. First, the DSM-IV categories hypoactive sexual desire dis-
order (as it relates to females) and female sexual arousal disorder have been merged
into a single category: female sexual interest/arousal disorder. Second, in DSM-5, hy-
poactive sexual desire disorder is now specifically focused on men and has been re-
named male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Third, sexual aversion disorder has
been eliminated.
_Orgasm,_ the third phase of the sexual response cycle, is the shortest phase and may
last only a few seconds or minutes. This phase consists of a release of sexual tension,
ejaculation of semen, and vaginal contractions. DSM-5 disorders corresponding to this
phase include female orgasmic disorder, delayed ejaculation, and premature (early)
ejaculation. The DSM-IV disorders male orgasmic disorder and premature ejacula-
tion have been replaced by delayed ejaculation and premature (early) ejaculation, re-
spectively.


**276** DSM-5 Guidebook

During _resolution,_ the final stage of the sexual response cycle, the body slowly re-
turns to normal, with swelling and erection resolving, and a sense of well-being oc-
curring. No DSM-5 disorders correspond to this phase.
In addition to disorders associated with the sexual response cycle, DSM-5 includes
genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, which involves experiencing physical pain
or discomfort during sexual intercourse. Having a single disorder referring to pain or
discomfort reflects a change from DSM-IV, in which two specific pain disorders—
dyspareunia and vaginismus—were included. DSM-5 has also expanded the previ-
ous category of substance-induced sexual dysfunction to include medication (sub-
stance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction).
DSM-5 criteria for the sexual dysfunctions have several elements in common. Cri-
terion A describes the disorder, Criteria B–D are the same for all disorders (except
substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, which has an additional crite-
rion), and the subtypes and specifiers are identical for most disorders (with some
variation for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and for substance/medication-
induced sexual dysfunction). In addition, the sexual dysfunction category includes an
other specified and an unspecified disorder to account for symptoms that do not meet
the full criteria for any of the disorders in the diagnostic class. These replace the DSM-
IV “not otherwise specified” categories.
To avoid redundancy, the criteria for delayed ejaculation are presented as an ex-
ample, and readers are referred to DSM-5 for the specific criteria for the other sexual
dysfunctions. Because occasional sexual dysfunction is an inherent part of human
sexuality and not indicative of a disorder, only symptoms that persist are considered
for purposes of a diagnosis.

Sexual Dysfunction

Diagnostic Criteria for Delayed Ejaculation **302.74 (F52.32)**

A. Either of the following symptoms must be experienced on almost all or all occasions
(approximately 75%–100%) of partnered sexual activity (in identified situational con-
texts or, if generalized, in all contexts), and without the individual desiring delay:

1. Marked delay in ejaculation.
2. Marked infrequency or absence of ejaculation.

B. The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of approxi-
mately 6 months.
C. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in the individual.
D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a
consequence of severe relationship distress or other significant stressors and is not at-
tributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition.

Specify whether:
**Lifelong:** The disturbance has been present since the individual became sexually
active.
**Acquired:** The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal sexual function.


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **277**

Specify whether:
**Generalized:** Not limited to certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners.
**Situational:** Only occurs with certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.
**Moderate:** Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.
**Severe:** Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

Criterion A

This item describes the symptoms of sexual dysfunction and establishes the fre-
quency for the symptoms. In most cases, the symptoms must be experienced on ap-
proximately 75%–100% of all occasions of sexual activity. This reflects a change from
DSM-IV, which stated that the sexual dysfunction had to be “persistent and recurrent,”
providing the clinician with little guidance to evaluating symptom frequency. This
criterion also prevents the overdiagnosis of a sexual dysfunction.

Criterion B

This item establishes the minimum duration of symptoms required for diagnosis with
the sexual dysfunction. In most cases, the symptoms need to be present for a mini-
mum duration of approximately 6 months.

Criterion C

This item states that the symptoms of sexual dysfunction “cause clinically significant
distress.” This criterion, like the first two, differentiates sexual dysfunctions from
temporary difficulties with sexual functioning that are part of everyday life. The clin-
ically significant distress may take the form of social isolation, depression, and poor
self-esteem. Impairment from sexual dysfunction may include unstable relationships,
lack of dating, and abuse of substances to help cope. Criterion C reflects a change
from DSM-IV’s Criterion B, which stated, “the disturbance causes marked distress or
interpersonal difficulty.” The phrases “marked distress” and “interpersonal difficulty”
have been variously interpreted by clinicians and researchers, and the new language
provides greater clarity.

Criterion D

Other disorders or behaviors that could possibly exhibit themselves as a sexual dys-
function must be excluded. In DSM-IV, only substances and general medical condi-
tions were excluded. In DSM-5, the exclusions have been expanded to include distress
from a relationship and other stressors. For example, when a man is experiencing a
contentious divorce and reports low sexual desire only during the time of the ex-
tended proceedings, the diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would
not be appropriate.


**278** DSM-5 Guidebook

Subtypes and Specifiers

DSM-5 provides subtypes and specifiers for each of the sexual dysfunctions. Although
the subtypes are carried over from DSM-IV, the specifiers have been expanded to more
accurately reflect the variety of factors that can impact sexual functioning.
The lifelong and acquired subtypes apply to the onset of the sexual dysfunction.
_Lifelong_ refers to the failure to develop normal sexual functioning from first sexual ex-
periences, whereas _acquired_ refers to situations in which the person develops sexual
disorders after a period of relatively normal functioning.
The generalized and situational subtypes have also been carried over. _Generalized_
refers to sexual difficulties that are not limited to certain situations, partners, or types
of stimulation. _Situational_ refers to sexual difficulties that only occur with particular
partners, in certain situations, or with certain types of stimulation.
Current severity specifiers are provided to rate each disorder as mild (evidence of
mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A), moderate (evidence of moderate dis-
tress over the symptoms in Criterion A), or severe (evidence of severe or extreme dis-
tress over the symptoms in Criterion A).

Delayed Ejaculation

Delayed ejaculation applies when a man has a marked delay in or marked infrequency
or absence of orgasm. For some men, only certain types of stimulation lead to orgasm.
Others may experience an orgasm but only after prolonged and intense sexual activity
or stimulation.
Delayed ejaculation is the new name for DSM-IV male orgasmic disorder. The name
change reflects current terminology in the field. Given that men’s experiences of sex-
ual excitement are not uniform, the phrase “following a normal sexual excitement
phase” was eliminated from the diagnostic criteria.

Erectile Disorder

Erectile disorder applies to situations when a man is unable to attain or maintain an
adequate erection (Segraves 2010). This can happen at the outset of or during a sexual
encounter. Erectile disorder can interfere with fertility and produce low self-esteem.
In addition to the general changes for the overall category of sexual dysfunctions,
the diagnosis of erectile disorder underwent several changes in DSM-5. Whereas DSM-
IV stated that the disorder was defined as an “inability to attain, or to maintain until
completion of the sexual activity, an adequate erection,” DSM-5 requires one of three
possible symptoms: marked difficulty in obtaining an erection during sexual activity,
marked difficulty in maintaining an erection until completion of sexual activity, or
marked decrease in erectile rigidity.

Female Orgasmic Disorder

Female orgasmic disorder involves recurrent delay in, marked infrequency of, or ab-
sence of orgasm, or markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations. Women dem-


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **279**

onstrate wide variability in the type and intensity of stimulation needed for orgasm.
For this reason, the diagnosis requires that the symptoms are experienced on almost
all occasions of sexual activity.
DSM-5 includes three important changes to female orgasmic disorder. “Marked in-
frequency” of orgasms and “reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations” have been
added as symptoms, either of which can fulfill the diagnosis. The addition of “mark-
edly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations” reflects the fact that orgasm is not an
“all or nothing” phenomenon and that diminished intensity of orgasm may be a prob-
lem for some women. In addition, in DSM-5, the phrase “following a normal sexual ex-
citement phase” has been deleted because a woman’s experience of sexual excitement
is not uniform, there is good evidence of substantial variability, and none of the prev-
alence studies have assessed what constitutes a “normal sexual excitement phase.”

Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder

In DSM-5, aspects of both hypoactive sexual desire disorder and female sexual
arousal disorder have been combined to create female sexual interest/arousal disor-
der. The diagnosis applies when a woman has either a lack of interest in sexual activ-
ity or an inability to attain or maintain arousal.
The name change reflects the common experience that desire and (at least subjec-
tive) arousal highly overlap. In some women, desire precedes arousal; in other women,
desire follows arousal. There are inconsistencies in how desire is defined, with some
definitions focusing on sexual behavior as an indicator of desire, others focusing on
spontaneous sexual thoughts and fantasies, and still others emphasizing the respon-
sive nature of women’s desire. The word _desire_ in DSM-IV hypoactive sexual desire
disorder has been changed to _interest_ because _desire_ connotes a deficiency and often
implies a biological urge. The phrase “an adequate lubrication-swelling response of
sexual excitement” in DSM-IV female sexual arousal disorder has been eliminated be-
cause evidence suggests that increases in vaginal blood flow during exposure to sex-
ual stimuli may be a relatively “automatic response,” and one that women may or
may not be aware of. Furthermore, there is little evidence that women with a sexual
arousal disorder have impaired genital response; lubrication may or may not co-occur
with subjective arousal. Finally, there is evidence that women report a wide range of
nongenital and genital changes, and it is unclear how common the “lubrication-swell-
ing response” is.

Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder

Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder applies when a person has pain or discom-
fort, muscular tightening, or fear or anxiety about pain when having sexual inter-
course. This disorder reflects a change from DSM-IV, in which two distinct disor-
ders—dyspareunia and vaginismus—were used to diagnose sexual pain disorders,
both now subsumed within this new category. Dyspareunia and vaginismus were un-
reliable diagnoses, and it was difficult for clinicians to distinguish between them. The
new category will correct that situation, yet allow for the diagnosis of pain and pen-


**280** DSM-5 Guidebook

etration disorders. This will also provide a framework to facilitate clinician evalua-
tion, diagnosis, and referral.

Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder

Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder applies when a man has diminished desire for
sexual activity and few if any sexual thoughts or fantasies (Brotto 2010). Because DSM-
5 has a new diagnosis for low sexual desire and arousal problems in women (i.e., female
sexual interest/arousal disorder), male hypoactive sexual desire disorder was created
to enable a clinician to diagnose a man’s diminished sexual desire. Other than the gen-
eral changes to the category of sexual dysfunction in DSM-5, as stated earlier in this
chapter, the criteria for male hypoactive sexual desire disorder are essentially un-
changed from DSM-IV.

Premature (Early) Ejaculation

Early ejaculation is a condition in which a man ejaculates “during partnered sexual
activity within approximately 1 minute following vaginal penetration and before the
individual wishes it.” Early ejaculation is more common in novel sexual situations
and in men who have had a substantial interval since last orgasm.
The definition of early ejaculation has been operationalized by the use of “approx-
imately 1 minute” as the amount of time after initiation of sexual activity that ejacu-
lation occurs.
DSM-5 notes that premature (early) ejaculation can occur during nonvaginal sex-
ual activities, but that specific duration criteria have not been established and thus are
not included.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Sexual Dysfunction

Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction applies when a clinically signifi-
cant sexual dysfunction develops during or soon after substance intoxication or with-
drawal or exposure to a medication, and the substance/medication is capable of pro-
ducing the symptoms. Acute intoxication with or chronic abuse of various substances
(e.g., alcohol, nicotine, opiates, sedatives) may result in sexual dysfunction. In addition,
many medications (e.g., antihypertensives, antidepressants, antipsychotics) may cause
a decrease in sexual interest and result in sexual performance difficulties.


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **281**

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Sexual Dysfunction

A. A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is predominant in the clinical pic-
ture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction that is not sub-
stance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction
could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the ces-
sation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced
sexual dysfunction (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related
episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the individual.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/med-
ication]-induced sexual dysfunctions are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use dis-
order present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is co-
morbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is
“1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the sub-
stance-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-in-
duced sexual dysfunction”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is
comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is
“2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe
[substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use
disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy
use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should
record only the substance-induced sexual dysfunction.


**282** DSM-5 Guidebook

Specify if (see Table 16–1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders”
for diagnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
**With onset during withdrawal:** If criteria are met for withdrawal from the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.
**With onset after medication use:** Symptoms may appear either at initiation of
medication or after a modification or change in use.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Occurs on 25%–50% of occasions of sexual activity.
**Moderate:** Occurs on 50%–75% of occasions of sexual activity.

The DSM-5 criteria state that the dysfunction has to have started during or soon
after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. These
criteria reflect a change from DSM-IV, which failed to account for changes in dosage
increase and discontinuation being potential causes of the sexual dysfunction.

Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction and

Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction

Sexual dysfunctions that do not meet criteria for any specific sexual dysfunction are
classified as other specified or unspecified sexual dysfunction. The “other specified”
diagnosis is appropriate when the clinician has concluded that a sexual dysfunction is
present but does not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders. In this instance the
clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason the presentation does not meet
the criteria (e.g., by specifying “sexual aversion”). The category unspecified sexual
dysfunction applies when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present but the clini-
cian chooses not to specify why the criteria are not met for a specific disorder. It may


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **283**

also be used when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis
of a sexual dysfunction.

GENDER DYSPHORIA

_Gender dysphoria_ refers to the distress that may accompany the mismatch between one’s
assigned gender and how a person perceives their true gender. The DSM classifications
of this disorder reflect the tension within the field as to how best to conceptualize the
disorder. In DSM-III, transsexualism and gender identity disorder of childhood were
introduced, both placed in the chapter titled “Psychosexual Disorders.” In DSM-III-R,
both disorders were moved to the chapter titled “Disorders First Evident in Infancy,
Childhood, or Adolescence.” Also included was the diagnosis gender identity disorder
of adolescence or adulthood, nontranssexual type, for cross-gender-identified individ-
uals who did not pursue sex reassignment. DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR included only one
specific diagnosis, gender identity disorder, along with gender identity disorder not
otherwise specified, in the chapter titled “Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders.” Al-
though the DSM terminology and categorization of gender identity disorders have var-
ied over time, the fundamental nature of the disorder—distress about one’s assigned
gender—remains a consistent and unifying feature. Table 14–2 lists the DSM-5 gender
dysphoria diagnoses.

Gender Dysphoria in Children

Gender dysphoria is characterized by marked incongruence between the person’s as-
signed gender and their expressed gender.
In response to criticisms that the term _gender identity disorder_ was stigmatizing, it
has been renamed _gender dysphoria_ in DSM-5. In addition, subtypes pertaining to sex-
ual attraction were eliminated, and a new subtype categorization that recognizes indi-
viduals with a medical disorder of sex development was introduced.

Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Dysphoria in Children **302.6 (F64.2)**

A. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and as-
signed gender, of at least 6 months’ duration, as manifested by at least six of the
following (one of which must be Criterion A1):

1. A strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that one is the other
    gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender).


**284** DSM-5 Guidebook

2. In boys (assigned gender), a strong preference for cross-dressing or simulating
    female attire; or in girls (assigned gender), a strong preference for wearing only
    typical masculine clothing and a strong resistance to the wearing of typical fem-
    inine clothing.
3. A strong preference for cross-gender roles in make-believe play or fantasy play.
4. A strong preference for the toys, games, or activities stereotypically used or en-
    gaged in by the other gender.
5. A strong preference for playmates of the other gender.
6. In boys (assigned gender), a strong rejection of typically masculine toys,
    games, and activities and a strong avoidance of rough-and-tumble play; or in
    girls (assigned gender), a strong rejection of typically feminine toys, games,
    and activities.
7. A strong dislike of one’s sexual anatomy.
8. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics that match
    one’s experienced gender.

B. The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in so-
cial, school, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**With a disorder of sex development** (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder
such as 255.2 [E25.0] congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 259.50 [E34.50] androgen
insensitivity syndrome).
**Coding note:** Code the disorder of sex development as well as gender dysphoria.

Criterion A

Because some degree of cross-gender identification is not pathological, DSM-5 has
eliminated the DSM-IV wording “strong and persistent” and instead introduced a
minimum duration requirement of 6 months and raised the threshold from four to six
indicators of “marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and
assigned gender.” These changes reflect the intensity and duration of cross-gender
identification and help avoid the problem of overdiagnosis.

Criterion B

The condition causes clinically significant distress or impairment. In children, this may
include problems in school performance, refusal to attend school (where they may be
exposed to taunts and bullying), social isolation, and depression. They may feel that
no one understands them and that they do not fit in with other children.

Specifiers

The specifiers have replaced DSM-IV Criterion C, which stated, “The disturbance is not
concurrent with a physical intersex condition.” A specifier has been added: “with a dis-
order of sex development” (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder such as congenital
adrenal hyperplasia or androgen insensitivity syndrome). Gender dysphoria is com-
mon in individuals with and without intersex conditions, now referred to as _disorders of
sex development._


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **285**

Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults

The diagnosis of gender dysphoria requires discomfort with one’s own assigned gen-
der and clinically significant distress or impairment. In adolescents and adults, the
disturbance is manifested by symptoms such as stated desire to be of the other gen-
der, frequent passing as the other gender, desire to live as the other gender, and the
conviction that the person has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender.

Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Dysphoria in
Adolescents and Adults **302.85 (F64.1)**

A. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and as-
signed gender, of at least 6 months’ duration, as manifested by at least two of the
following:

1. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and pri-
    mary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or in young adolescents, the antic-
    ipated secondary sex characteristics).
2. A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
because of a marked incongruence with one’s experienced/expressed gender
(or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated
secondary sex characteristics).
3. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the oth-
er gender.
4. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different
from one’s assigned gender).
5. A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender
different from one’s assigned gender).
6. A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other
gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender).

B. The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in so-
cial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**With a disorder of sex development** (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder
such as 255.2 [E25.0] congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 259.50 [E34.50] androgen
insensitivity syndrome).
**Coding note:** Code the disorder of sex development as well as gender dysphoria.

Specify if:
**Posttransition:** The individual has transitioned to full-time living in the desired
gender (with or without legalization of gender change) and has undergone (or is
preparing to have) at least one cross-sex medical procedure or treatment regi-
men—namely, regular cross-sex hormone treatment or gender reassignment sur-
gery confirming the desired gender (e.g., penectomy, vaginoplasty in a natal male;
mastectomy or phalloplasty in a natal female).


**286** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion A

The focus is on the discrepancy between experienced or expressed gender (which can
be either male, female, in between, or otherwise) and assigned gender (in most so-
cieties male or female) rather than cross-gender identification and same-gender
aversion. For the adult criteria, DSM-5 requires at least two of six indicators of the
condition.

Criterion B

The condition causes clinically significant distress or impairment. Adolescents and
adults with gender dysphoria may become socially isolated, abuse alcohol or other
drugs to cope, and have difficulties with work or interpersonal relationships.

Specifiers

Two specifiers have replaced the DSM-IV criterion “The disturbance is not concurrent
with a physical intersex condition.” First, the specifier “with a disorder of sex devel-
opment” (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder such as congenital adrenal hyper-
plasia or androgen insensitivity syndrome) has been added to further describe the
gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is common in individuals with and without in-
tersex conditions, now referred to as _disorders of sex development._ Second, “posttransi-
tion” has been added as the other specifier. This addition was prompted by the
observation that for many individuals, after transition, no criteria for gender dyspho-
ria are met, but they continue to undergo chronic hormone treatment, further gender-
confirming surgery, or intermittent psychotherapy or counseling to facilitate adapta-
tion to life in the desired gender and the social consequences of the transition. The
concept of posttransition is modeled on the concept “in partial or full remission,” which
is used for mood disorders.

Other Specified Gender Dysphoria and

Unspecified Gender Dysphoria

These diagnostic categories apply to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of gender dysphoria that cause significant distress or functional impairment predom-
inate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria. The other specified cate-
gory is used when the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria. The unspecified cate-
gory is used when the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are
not met for gender dysphoria, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

PARAPHILIC DISORDERS

Paraphilic disorders are characterized by intense and persistent sexual interest other
than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with mature con-
senting humans.


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **287**

The paraphilias have been recognized for centuries. In terms of formal classifica-
tion, paraphilias were recognized in DSM-I and DSM-II as a form of personality dis-
turbance, but in DSM-III they were placed in the chapter “Psychosexual Disorders”
and diagnostic criteria were developed. The paraphilias continued relatively un-
changed through subsequent editions, included in chapters containing the sexual dys-
functions (and gender identity disorder in DSM-IV). In DSM-5, paraphilic disorders
have their own chapter.
Because not all paraphilias are considered mental disorders, DSM-5 makes a dis-
tinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders. A paraphilic disorder diagno-
sis requires that a paraphilia cause distress or impairment to the individual, or entail
personal harm, or risk of harm, to others. A paraphilia is a necessary but not a suffi-
cient condition for having a paraphilic disorder. Having a paraphilia does not in and
of itself automatically justify or require clinical intervention.
In the diagnostic criteria set for each of the listed paraphilic disorders, Criterion A
specifies the qualitative nature of the paraphilia (e.g., cross-dressing) and Criterion B
specifies the negative consequences of the paraphilia (significant distress or impair-
ment in important areas of functioning).
Course specifiers have been added for each of the paraphilic disorders, allowing
for the documentation of changes in an individual’s status. “In a controlled environ-
ment” is included because the propensity of an individual to act on paraphilic urges
may be more difficult to assess objectively when the individual has no opportunity to
act on such urges. “In full remission” indicates that the individual has not acted on
the urges with a nonconsenting person and/or has had no distress or impairment in
functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.
DSM-5 includes 10 paraphilic disorders, as listed in Table 14–3. Each is discussed
in turn, and changes from DSM-IV are highlighted.

Voyeuristic Disorder

Voyeuristic disorder is defined by the act of observing an unsuspecting person(s) who
is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaged in sexual activity. The individual has


**288** DSM-5 Guidebook

acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fan-
tasies have resulted in clinically significant distress or functional impairment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Voyeuristic Disorder **302.82 (F65.3)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from ob-
serving an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or en-
gaging in sexual activity, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or
the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The individual experiencing the arousal and/or acting on the urges is at least 18 years
of age.

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in voyeuristic
behavior are restricted.
**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting
person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Exhibitionistic Disorder

Exhibitionistic disorder is defined by the exposure of one’s genitalia to an unsuspect-
ing individual, with the additional requirement that the person has acted on these
sexual urges with a nonconsenting person or the sexual urges or fantasies have re-
sulted in clinically significant distress or functional impairment.
In addition to the overall changes to the paraphilic disorders in DSM-5, specifiers
have been added for exhibitionistic disorder regarding the age of the unsuspecting in-
dividuals.

Diagnostic Criteria for Exhibitionistic Disorder **302.4 (F65.2)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the
exposure of one’s genitals to an unsuspecting person, as manifested by fantasies,
urges, or behaviors.
B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or
the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify whether:
**Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children
Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to physically mature individuals**


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **289**

```
Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children and to physi-
cally mature individuals
```
Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living
in institutional or other settings where opportunities to expose one’s genitals are re-
stricted.
**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting
person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Frotteuristic Disorder

Frotteuristic disorder involves sexual arousal from touching or rubbing against a
nonconsenting person. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a noncon-
senting person, or the individual’s sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically signifi-
cant distress or functional impairment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Frotteuristic Disorder **302.89 (F65.81)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from
touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as manifested by fantasies,
urges, or behaviors.
B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or
the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to touch or rub against a
nonconsenting person are restricted.
**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting
person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Sexual Masochism Disorder

Sexual masochism disorder involves the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or
otherwise made to suffer. The fantasies, urges, or behaviors need to also result in clin-
ically significant distress or functional impairment.
In DSM-5, the unique specifier regarding asphyxiophilia has been added because
of the high rates of mortality associated with the behavior.


**290** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Sexual Masochism Disorder **302.83 (F65.51)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the
act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, as manifested
by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**With asphyxiophilia:** If the individual engages in the practice of achieving sexual
arousal related to restriction of breathing.

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in masochistic
sexual behaviors are restricted.
**In full remission:** There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Sexual Sadism Disorder

Sexual sadism disorder involves acts in which the person recurrently derives intense
sexual arousal from the physical or psychological suffering of another person. For the
behavior to merit a disorder, however, the individual has to have acted on these sex-
ual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies must cause
clinically significant distress or functional impairment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Sexual Sadism Disorder **302.84 (F65.52)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the
physical or psychological suffering of another person, as manifested by fantasies,
urges, or behaviors.
B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the
sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in sadistic sex-
ual behaviors are restricted.
**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting
person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **291**

Pedophilic Disorder

Pedophilic disorder is defined by sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviors
involving sexual activities with a prepubescent child (generally age 13 years or
younger). Some individuals with this disorder are only attracted to children, whereas
others are also attracted to adults. For the criteria for pedophilic disorder to be met,
however, the individual has to have acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges
or fantasies must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. The individual
must be at least 16 years old and at least 5 years older than the child to whom the fan-
tasies or behavior is directed.
DSM-5 has included unique specifiers to designate whether the individual is also
attracted to adults, which gender the individual is attracted to, and whether the at-
traction is only to family members (incest).

Diagnostic Criteria for Pedophilic Disorder **302.2 (F65.4)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies,
sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or chil-
dren (generally age 13 years or younger).
B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies
cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.
C. The individual is at least age 16 years and at least 5 years older than the child or
children in Criterion A.
**Note:** Do not include an individual in late adolescence involved in an ongoing sex-
ual relationship with a 12- or 13-year-old.
Specify whether:
**Exclusive type** (attracted only to children)
**Nonexclusive type**

Specify if:
**Sexually attracted to males
Sexually attracted to females
Sexually attracted to both**

Specify if:
**Limited to incest**

Fetishistic Disorder

Fetishistic disorder involves the use of nonliving objects, such as underwear or shoes,
or a highly specific focus on a nongenital body part(s) for sexual arousal. For the be-
havior to merit a diagnosis, however, the fantasies, urges, or behaviors need to result
in clinically significant distress or functional impairment.
Criterion C reflects the need to distinguish fetishistic disorder from transvestic
disorder. In DSM-5, a unique specifier has been added that details the object of the fe-
tish (e.g., body part[s]).


**292** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Fetishistic Disorder **302.81 (F65.0)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from either
the use of nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on nongenital body part(s), as
manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The fetish objects are not limited to articles of clothing used in cross-dressing (as
in transvestic disorder) or devices specifically designed for the purpose of tactile
genital stimulation (e.g., vibrator).

Specify:
**Body part(s)
Nonliving object(s)
Other**

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in fetishistic
behaviors are restricted.
**In full remission:** There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupation-
al, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled envi-
ronment.

Transvestic Disorder

Transvestic disorder is characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from
cross-dressing. In addition, the urges, fantasies, or behavior causes the person clini-
cally significant distress or functional impairment.
The name has changed from transvestic fetishism to transvestic disorder. DSM-5
does not include Criterion C from the DSM-IV criteria, which stated that the cross-
dressing could not occur exclusively during the course of gender identity disorder. In
addition, DSM-5 has removed the requirement that the disorder only be diagnosed in
heterosexual males. Unique specifiers have been added to the DSM-5 criteria regard-
ing whether the objects are the main driving force or whether the individual imagines
himself as the female.

Diagnostic Criteria for Transvestic Disorder **302.3 (F65.1)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from
cross-dressing, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **293**

Specify if:
**With fetishism:** If sexually aroused by fabrics, materials, or garments.
**With autogynephilia:** If sexually aroused by thoughts or images of self as female.

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to cross-dress are re-
stricted.
**In full remission:** There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupation-
al, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled envi-
ronment.

Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder and

Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder

Other specified and unspecified paraphilic disorders are residual categories that re-
place DSM-IV’s paraphilia not otherwise specified. The former is a category for para-
philic disorders that cause distress or impairment but do not meet the full criteria for
any of the specific paraphilic disorders. It is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the reason (e.g., zoophilia). The category unspecified para-
philic disorder is used when the paraphilic disorder causes distress or impairment but
does not meet the full criteria for any of the specific paraphilic disorders and the clini-
cian chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met, and includes pre-
sentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder **302.89 (F65.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a paraphilic
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the paraphilic disorders diagnostic class. The other specified paraphilic
disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the
specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific paraphilic
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified paraphilic disorder” followed by the
specific reason (e.g., “zoophilia”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include, but are not limited to, recurrent and intense sexual arousal involving
telephone scatologia (obscene phone calls), necrophilia (corpses), zoophilia (animals),
coprophilia (feces), klismaphilia (enemas), or urophilia (urine) that has been present for
at least 6 months and causes marked distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning. Other specified paraphilic disorder can be spec-
ified as in remission and/or as occurring in a controlled environment.


**294** DSM-5 Guidebook

Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder **302.9 (F65.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a paraphilic
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the paraphilic disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified paraphilic dis-
order category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason
that the criteria are not met for a specific paraphilic disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

- Each of the three classes of disorders discussed in this chapter—sexual dys-
    functions, gender dysphoria, and paraphilic disorders—has its own chapter in
    DSM-5, rather than all being grouped together as in DSM-IV.
- The DSM-IV categories hypoactive sexual desire disorder (as it relates to fe-
    males) and female sexual arousal disorder are now combined into a single disor-
    der: female sexual interest/arousal disorder. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder
    as it relates to men is now called male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Sexual
    aversion disorder has been eliminated.
- Gender identity disorder has been renamed gender dysphoria to help avoid
    stigma associated with the word disorder.
- Paraphilias have been renamed paraphilic disorders to help distinguish the dis-
    orders from nonpathological sexual preference (paraphilia).
