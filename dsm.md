##### Preface

This guidebook serves as a companion to the _Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual of Mental Disorders,_ 5th Edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association 2013).
DSM has long been used as the psychiatric diagnostic system in the United States and
elsewhere, and DSM-5 follows in the grand tradition of its predecessors. For many
mental health practitioners, however, the method of psychiatric diagnostic classifica-
tion is daunting. Because DSM-5 is large, totaling 947 pages (not including the classi-
fication listing and preface), many users will find it intimidating. Many will think,
“Where do I begin? How will I ever understand and use the criteria?” Also, users of
DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 2000) will wonder how DSM-5 differs.
These are some of the bread-and-butter issues we tackle in this guidebook.
Our goal with this book is not to recapitulate DSM-5. Rather, we aim to provide a
user-friendly guide for fellow psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health prac-
titioners, as well as other interested persons. We begin with the premise that users first
and foremost want to know how DSM-5 differs from its immediate predecessor, DSM-
IV-TR, in terms of its overall organization, the many diagnostic categories, and the di-
agnostic criteria themselves. In addressing these issues, we describe the rationale behind
the reorganization and the many changes to the criteria. We strongly encourage read-
ers to obtain a copy of DSM-5 and to study the diagnostic categories that are particularly
relevant to their practice needs, while understanding that such a large—and, to some, un-
wieldy—book is not easily learned or digested.
In many ways this guidebook is an “owner’s manual” to help practitioners incor-
porate DSM-5 into their practice. The book was written to teach clinicians how to use
the revised diagnostic criteria. We explain the overall metastructure (i.e., organiza-
tion) of DSM-5, its many diagnostic categories (including several new ones), and the
diagnostic criteria for major disorders. We focus on the most important diagnoses and
provide detailed descriptions of their criteria. In doing so, we place the criteria into
context and provide a contrast to the prior edition. We believe _DSM-5 Guidebook_ pro-
vides a blueprint to the many changes in the manual and practical information on the
use of the many diagnostic categories and their codes.
To summarize, our goals in this guidebook are to

1. Provide an overview of diagnostic classification so as to place DSM-5 and its pre-
    decessors into historical perspective.
2. Review the development of DSM-5, and its innovations, its overall structure, and
    the major changes from DSM-IV (and DSM-IV-TR).
3. Discuss each major diagnostic category, associated diagnoses, and the criteria to clar-
    ify their meaning and facilitate understanding of the differential diagnostic process.

4. Explain the various components that constitute a complete DSM-5 diagnosis, in-
    cluding the use of dimensional scales described in Section III.

Diagnosis is fundamental to the practice of psychiatry and psychology. For many
clinicians, the process of formulating a diagnosis takes years to master; however, it is
an essential process for mental health practitioners to learn and in which to gain ex-
pertise. The introduction of operational diagnostic criteria in DSM-III (American Psy-
chiatric Association 1980) greatly facilitated the process by making diagnosis far more
reliable than it had been previously, and much less subject to the particular views and
biases of the clinician. The two of us were both trained in the post–DSM-III era. To us,
the use of criteria-based diagnoses is second nature.
DSM-5 is transformative in several respects (Kupfer and Regier 2011; Kupfer et al.
2013). The road to DSM-5 began in 1999, and its publication in 2013 was the culmina-
tion of a lengthy and labor-intensive process, reviewed in Chapter 1, “The March to
DSM-5.” The journey involved the efforts of many experts who carefully reviewed
the literature, collected new data, and performed targeted analyses of existing data.
DSM-5’s predecessor, DSM-IV, was published in 1994 (American Psychiatric Associ-
ation 1994), with a text revision in 2000 (DSM-IV-TR). For all intents and purposes, the
DSM-5 criteria have been 19 years in the making. Not only have the diagnostic criteria
been revised and updated, but chapter placement has changed. New categories have
been introduced, and others have been consolidated. Many new disorders are in-
cluded, and the multiaxial diagnostic scheme has been eliminated. Many dimen-
sional assessments have been added to help clinicians better describe the patient’s
symptoms and functioning.
Symbolic of the transformation is that, unlike prior editions, DSM-5 has been dis-
cussed as a “living document.” A future longer-term goal is to update DSM-5 in re-
sponse to scientific advances _as they occur._ This is reflected in the decision to use an
Arabic rather than a Roman numeral in the title—DSM-5 rather than DSM-V—so that fu-
ture changes can be easily designated (e.g., DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2).
Make no mistake: DSM-5 is not inerrant. Those unfamiliar with the diagnostic pro-
cess—and even some who are—consider the criteria with the same reverence they might
apply to passages in such books as the Bible or Talmud. Others may see the diagnostic
process as a cookbook in which each ingredient (i.e., criterion) is essential and any de-
viation invariably leads to fallen soufflé. We remind readers that DSM-5—or for that
matter any diagnostic manual—cannot be used without applying clinical judgment.
This is the critical element missing from any manual and not easily learned in the ab-
sence of training and practice. Will a psychiatrist tell a patient he is not depressed just
because he fails to meet a diagnostic threshold? Is a psychotic patient whose symptoms
fail to meet each criterion for schizophrenia less ill? Overly strict adherence to the
rules (i.e., criteria) can get in the way of appropriate clinical care, and clinicians must
be mindful of each patient’s needs, not the sometimes arbitrary requirements of a cod-
ing system.
We have approached this guidebook informed by our day-to-day work as clini-
cians and researchers. We provide no insider detail about the workings of the DSM-
Task Force or its many work groups because we have no personal knowledge of them.


**_Preface_** **xiii**

In this respect, we write as outsiders tasked with explaining how the criteria sets are
appropriately used in clinical and research settings. A disclaimer: What we have writ-
ten reflects our views and not those of the DSM-5 Task Force or the American Psychi-
atric Association (APA). Neither of us served in any of the work groups. We did not
edit and are not responsible for any of the content of DSM-5. Nonetheless, we are not
uninformed about psychiatric diagnosis, or about the needs of our fellow practitioners
or of trainees, because each of us serves as a faculty member at a major academic psy-
chiatry department. Each of us has extensive experience educating residents, medical
students, and other learners in the arcane rules of psychiatric diagnosis, a process that
seems mysterious and impossibly difficult to the uninitiated, though routine (and
even fun) from our perspective.
For perspective, both DSM-III and DSM-IV were met with criticism from all sides
and yet emerged as healthy and influential documents. The APA Assembly approved
DSM-5 in November 2012 without recommending changes, and the document was
later unanimously accepted by the APA Board of Trustees. DSM-5 Task Force Co-Chairs
David J. Kupfer, M.D., and Darrel A. Regier, M.D., M.P.H., deserve enormous credit
for shepherding the process and keeping it on task, if not on schedule. Although we
provide, in the introduction, an overview of the process that led to DSM-5, we make
no attempt to provide a more detailed history of the process. That will be left to oth-
ers. Already, many volumes have been published presenting early views on the pro-
cess of revision, as well as the goals and objectives for DSM-5.
Let us review the structure of this guidebook. In the introduction, we briefly re-
view the history of psychiatric diagnostic classification. Then, in Chapter 1, we focus
on the march to DSM-5. Chapter 2 provides a crosswalk from DSM-IV to DSM-5, fo-
cusing on the major changes but not the many minor edits. In Chapters 3–19, we re-
view the major diagnostic categories and specific diagnoses and their criteria to
provide clarity to their assessment. Dimensional scales embedded in DSM-5 are dis-
cussed in Chapter 20, and an alternative model for personality disorders is presented
in Chapter 21. Proposed disorders under consideration are reviewed in Chapter 22. A
list of references and an appendix with the DSM-5 classification follow.
We believe this guidebook will appeal to a wide audience of practicing psychia-
trists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, and mental health profes-
sionals who wish to know how to implement DSM-5 in their ongoing practices. We
expect that institutional audiences will include solo and small practices, health main-
tenance organizations, insurance providers, hospitals, libraries, academic institu-
tions, medical school courses, and residency training programs. Students, residents,
and office staff will also benefit from the guidebook, which will help them to better
understand how DSM-5 diagnoses fit into current mental health practice. It is our
hope that many will find this book useful for training health professionals of all
stripes in the use of DSM-5.

##### Acknowledgments

When approached about writing this book, we jumped at the opportu-
nity. The two of us are clinicians and educators highly interested in psychiatric clas-
sification and assessment. Although we are both university-based psychiatrists and
researchers, we have been influenced by years of routine clinical care in all types of
settings: academic medical centers, freestanding mental health clinics, correctional
and forensic settings, and so on. Between us, we have more than 45 years of clinical
experience that we bring to this effort.
Our task was greatly facilitated by using the official Web site (www.dsm5.org)—
available to all persons—as well as by accessing DSM-5 drafts, which the American Psy-
chiatric Association graciously provided us. Much of our work involved a straightfor-
ward comparison of DSM-5 with its predecessors (particularly DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR),
allowing us to show where changes have been made and why. We are grateful to the
DSM-5 Task Force and work groups, and their many members and consultants. More
than 1,000 persons were involved in creating DSM-5. The monumental task took count-
less hours by colleagues who gave freely of their time to craft a book that takes our field
into the future.
In writing the guidebook, we were enormously influenced by our own experiences
in providing patient care, as well as our years of work in teaching medical students and
residents in psychiatric interviewing techniques and assessment methods. We are also
sensitive to the needs that researchers have to systematically collect diagnostic data. We
believe DSM-5 will be a major stimulant to research, as scientists retool their approach
and incorporate new and reformulated criteria sets into their assessments.
Our practice style and knowledge base were also shaped by our training experi-
ences. One of us (D.W.B.) trained in the psychiatry department at the University of
Iowa. Under the leadership of the late George Winokur, M.D., the department was a
member of the “invisible college” of neo-Kraepelinians, whose members were re-
sponsible for the first useful criteria sets in psychiatry—the Feighner criteria and,
later, the Research Diagnostic Criteria, both of which were the intellectual forerunners
to DSM-III, as we discuss in more detail in the Introduction. The other (J.E.G.) trained
at the University of Minnesota, whose psychiatry department was led for a time by
another member of the “invisible college,” Paula Clayton, M.D. These experiences led
us to appreciate the value of evidence-based operational criteria for both clinical and
research use.
We are indebted to the staff at American Psychiatric Publishing. In particular, we
are grateful to Robert E. Hales, M.D., who helped shape the book’s vision and scope,
and John McDuffie, who provided needed encouragement and support. In addition
to the editorial staff, we wish to thank the many important mentors who have influ-

enced us in our careers, including Nancy Andreasen, M.D., Raymond Crowe, M.D.,
Russell Noyes, M.D., William Coryell, M.D., Bruce Pfohl, M.D., Suck Won Kim, M.D.,
Katharine Phillips, M.D., Larry Price, M.D., and Steve Rasmussen, M.D. Robert
Spitzer, M.D., a friend and colleague who led both the DSM-III and DSM-III-R Task
Forces, has been an inspiration. Special thanks go to Susan Schultz, M.D., a University
of Iowa colleague known for her good cheer. As text editor for DSM-5, she was espe-
cially knowledgeable about the manual.
We are also grateful to the countless patients with whom we have worked in Iowa,
Minnesota, and elsewhere, who have taught us much of what we know about their
disorders. They are the true teachers.


##### Introduction

```
Science is the systematic classification of experience.
George Henry Lewes, The Physical Basis of Mind, 1877
```
Fourteen years in development, the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders,_ 5th Edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association 2013), is a
landmark publication that sets an international standard for psychiatric diagnosis
and classification. Published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), DSM-
follows a noble tradition set by its predecessors, beginning with the first edition
(DSM-I), which appeared in 1952 (American Psychiatric Association 1952). DSM pro-
vides a compendium of all officially recognized diagnoses used in psychiatry and
specifies the symptoms that must be present. The development of DSM was the prod-
uct of the first systematic effort to create an official classification scheme for psychiat-
ric disorders in the United States. Psychiatry is the only specialty in medicine that has
consistently and comprehensively formalized the diagnostic processes for the disor-
ders within its domain.
To those of us in psychiatry, the use of DSM is second nature, having been embed-
ded in our training and clinical experience. Colleagues outside the field, however, may
wonder what the fuss is about. Why be concerned with DSM? Why indeed. Simply
put, DSM provides a common language to those among us who conduct research on
and/or treat individuals with psychiatric disorders. Perhaps one of its most impor-
tant missions is to help ensure consistency in the definition of mental disorders for
clinicians in the United States and elsewhere. Developed for trained mental health
professionals, DSM is widely used beyond the confines of psychiatry. Among its
many users are researchers, administrators, civil servants, attorneys, and others. When
used as intended, DSM requires clinical expertise and training. An important limita-
tion is that it does not provide treatment information. Because psychiatry lacks specific
laboratory diagnostic tests and confirmed etiologies for most disorders, diagnosis relies
largely on the patient’s symptoms and history. For that reason, it is essential that di-
agnostic criteria be precise and clear.
The psychiatric profession regularly reviews and revises DSM in response to new
research findings. Science has rapidly advanced, particularly in the past two decades,
contributing to the many changes in DSM-5. In the 1990s we experienced the so-called
Decade of the Brain, followed by the Human Genome Project. We have since entered
the Decade of the Mind. This explosion of knowledge in neuroscience and behavioral
sciences has greatly expanded our understanding of mental disorders, including their
prevalence and risk factors, brain structure and function, and the influence of genes

and environment. Advances in technology have provided new tools that enable the
investigation of mental disorders in ways not previously possible. In response to new
knowledge, the classification of mental disorders—and their diagnostic criteria—
must evolve.

Historical Considerations

The classification of mental illnesses had its start more than two millennia ago, when
these conditions were first recognized as discrete illnesses. Perhaps the oldest medical
document in evidence, the Ebers Papyrus (probably composed about 1550 B.C.), con-
tains references to specific syndromes such as depression. Biblical writing also con-
tains descriptions of people who suffered from major mental illnesses; for example, in
1 Samuel, Saul is portrayed as falling into a serious depression for which he is treated
with soothing music.
Psychiatry owes a great deal to Hippocrates, who developed the first classification
of mental illnesses. This schema included epilepsy, mania (excitement), melancholia,
and paranoia, as well as toxic deliria (mental confusion accompanied by fever), and
hysteria (sudden episodes of somatic illness). Hippocrates and his followers believed
mental illnesses were due to imbalances in quantities of body fluids. Melancholia, for
example, was due to an excess of black bile, and other abnormalities arose from incorrect
balances between other fluids, or “humors” (blood, phlegm, and yellow bile). Hu-
moral theories of mental illness persisted into the Middle Ages, and even today influ-
ence our understanding of personality types.
During the European Renaissance and the Enlightenment, systems of classifica-
tion of disease were often patterned after those found in nature. In the sixteenth cen-
tury, Paracelsus (1493–1541) developed a classification based on etiologies, including
disorders caused by poisons, by phases of the moon, and by hereditary diseases.
Thomas Sydenham (1624–1689) was a leading proponent of the notion of discrete and
uniform disease categories. He offered detailed descriptions of the neuroses and hys-
teria. Contemporaries Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778) and François Boissier de Sau-
vages (1706–1767) attempted to apply the taxonomic methods of biology to medical
and psychiatric illnesses with categories based on observed signs and symptoms.
Boissier de Sauvage’s system listed more than two thousand diseases, arranged into
classes, orders, and genera. Jean-Étienne-Dominique Esquirol (1772–1840), like his
mentor Philippe Pinel (1745-1826), emphasized precise clinical description of mental
illnesses and avoided speculation about causation. (He is known also for coining the
word _hallucination._ )
A tension between paradigms based on observation and theory continued into the
nineteenth century. The establishment of asylums allowed more prolonged and inten-
sive observation of patients than had previously been possible. Autopsies were in-
creasingly common and widely accepted, as attempts were made to identify a physical
basis for psychiatric symptoms. Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926) aimed to develop a clas-
sification of mental disorders that emphasized the importance of symptoms, course
and outcome. He is perhaps best known for separating manic-depressive illness from
_dementia praecox._ The latter was renamed _schizophrenia_ (“splitting of the mind”) by Eu-


**_Introduction_** **xix**

gen Bleuler (1857–1939) to recognize the cognitive impairment that occurs and em-
phasize certain symptoms he felt were fundamental to the disorder, such as affective
flattening and disturbances of association (i.e., peculiar and distorted thinking). Krae-
pelin’s careful attention to symptoms and course in delineating syndromes later pro-
vided the basic conceptual framework for DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association
1980).
Beyond these historical trends, there was a growing need to develop classification
systems for statistical, epidemiological, and reporting purposes. The initial reason for
developing a classification of mental disorders in the United States was to collect sta-
tistical information for the census. For the 1880 census, seven categories of mental ill-
nesses were listed: mania, melancholia, monomania, paresis, dementia, dipsomania,
and epilepsy. The increasing role of government in health care created a greater push
for diagnostic uniformity in the period, and the first standard psychiatric classifica-
tion was produced in the United States in 1918 by the American Medico-Psychologi-
cal Association, forerunner of the APA. Published as the _Statistical Manual for the Use
of Institutions for the Insane,_ it listed 22 disorders and was primarily used to gather uni-
form statistics from mental institutions (Shorter 1997).

Development of DSM

In 1927 the New York Academy of Medicine spearheaded a movement to develop a
nationally accepted standard nomenclature of disease. The following year, a confer-
ence was organized that included participants from the government and all the med-
ical specialties, including psychiatry (represented by the APA). Published in 1933 by
the American Medical Association as _A Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease,_ the
manual contained 24 major psychiatric categories that were strongly influenced by the
sixth edition of Kraepelin’s (1899) _Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie._
In response to challenges faced by the military in the 1940s, and the need for more
suitable diagnostic categories to describe psychiatric problems faced by combatants,
the U.S. Army and Navy each developed their own classification system. Meanwhile,
the Veterans Administration created its own system to incorporate outpatient presen-
tations of World War II veterans. The situation with psychiatric nomenclature had led
to considerable confusion, and at least four different systems—the Standard and those
of the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and the Veterans Administration—were in place. Some
agencies used one system for clinical use, another for disability ratings, and a third
for statistical reporting. The sixth revision of the _Manual of International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death_ (ICD-6), developed in 1948 by the World
Health Organization (WHO), was not entirely satisfactory to American psychiatrists, so
the APA chose to develop its own manual.
The APA Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics set to work on a single na-
tional system of classification of mental illnesses, which led to the publication in 1952
of the first edition of the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM-I).
Relatively compact at 132 pages, DSM-I was the first official manual of mental disor-
ders to focus on clinical utility for classification. Definitions were relatively simple and
consisted of brief prototypical descriptions. Most disorders were “reactions” reflecting


**xx** DSM-5 Guidebook

the influence of Adolf Meyer and his psychobiological approach to psychiatry, which
hypothesized that disorders were types of reaction patterns that are exaggerations or
aberrations of, or substitutions for, normal, healthy, and adaptable ways of living. For
example, manic-depressive illness was defined in DSM-I as follows:

```
Manic Depressive Reactions: These groups comprise the psychotic reactions which
fundamentally are marked by severe mood swings and a tendency to remission and re-
currence. Various accessory symptoms such as illusions, delusions, and hallucinations
may be added to the fundamental affective alteration. Manic depressive reaction is syn-
onymous with the term manic depressive psychosis. The reaction will be further classi-
fied in to the appropriate one of the following types: manic, depressed, or other.
(American Psychiatric Association 1952, p. 25)
```
To encourage consistency internationally, WHO sponsored a revision that ap-
peared as ICD-8 in 1967 (World Health Organization 1967). The APA contributed to
ICD-8 and also published DSM-II (American Psychiatric Association 1968) the follow-
ing year. Among the several changes in DSM-II, the most striking was the omission of
the term _reaction_ from diagnoses. The names of several disorders were changed, and the
manual encouraged users to record multiple psychiatric diagnoses (listed in order of
importance) and associated physical conditions, which presaged the development of
the multiaxial diagnostic scheme of DSM-III.
In 1974 the APA created a task force to produce a revised version of DSM to coin-
cide with the publication of ICD-9 (World Health Organization 1977). Robert Spitzer,
head of the evaluation unit at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and consultant
for the DSM-II revision, was appointed to lead the group. Spitzer had a strong interest
in diagnosis and classification and was influenced by like-minded psychiatrists at
Washington University in St. Louis who, in 1972, had published the _Feighner criteria,_
named after first author—and psychiatric resident—John Feighner (Feighner et al.
1972). This was psychiatry’s first attempt to develop operationalized diagnostic crite-
ria. ( _Operational_ in this sense means taking something—in this case a diagnosis—and
breaking it down into its component parts so they can be taught and mastered.)
Although the attempt was relatively modest (resulting in criteria for 15 psychiat-
ric illnesses plus a residual category for individuals with undiagnosed symptoms),
the Feighner criteria created a firestorm of interest. The expectation of Eli Robins,
Samuel Guze, George Winokur, and other leaders of the St. Louis group was that each
clinical syndrome would ultimately be validated by coherence in its clinical picture,
separation (or “delimitation”) from other disorders, common prognosis and outcome,
genetic aggregation in families, and further differentiation by future laboratory tests
(which now include neuroimaging, molecular genetics, neuropsychological testing,
and so forth).
Spitzer and colleagues developed the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for use
in the longitudinal Collaborative Study on the Psychobiology of Depression supported
by the National Institute of Mental Health (Endicott and Spitzer 1978). Both the Feigh-
ner criteria and the RDC contributed to the intellectual ferment that led to DSM-III.
The fact that one-third of DSM-III Task Force members trained at Washington Univer-
sity was evidence of the influence of the “invisible college” of neo-Kraepelinians, as

they came to be known, who helped usher in an era of careful, systematic assessment
and classification.
Published in 1980, DSM-III created a sensation. A hefty tome that came in at 494
pages, DSM-III was a reflection of the increased emphasis on empirical data in psy-
chiatric practice and research. It was the first effort by a medical specialty to provide
a comprehensive and detailed diagnostic manual in which all disorders were defined
by specific criteria so that the methods for making a psychiatric diagnosis were rela-
tively clear. Great care was taken in preparing the criteria. Detailed drafts were writ-
ten, opinions were obtained from 550 clinicians, and results were subjected to field
tests of more than 12,000 patients. Furthermore, DSM-III was published in coordina-
tion with the development of the ninth revision of the ICD.
In addition to the inclusion of diagnostic criteria, the other major innovation of DSM-
III was the introduction of a multiaxial classification system. Five axes were described:

I. Clinical syndromes and “conditions not attributable to a mental disorder that are
the focus of attention and treatment”
II. Personality disorders and specific developmental disorders
III. Physical disorders
IV. Severity of psychosocial stressors
V. Highest level of adaptive functioning in the last year

DSM-III relied less than its predecessors on psychoanalytic concepts, and its descrip-
tive approach was meant to be neutral (“atheoretical”) with regard to etiology. This
approach was taken because task force members felt that the inclusion of etiological
theories would present an “obstacle to use of the manual by clinicians of varying the-
oretical orientations since it would not be possible to present all reasonable etiologic
theories for each disorder” (American Psychiatric Association 1980, p. 7).
Another major goal of DSM-III was to improve upon the poor reliability that had
plagued previous systems. Because of their vagueness and imprecision, definitions in
DSM-I and DSM-II did not facilitate communication between clinicians and often
failed to distinguish one disorder from another. Research investigations had made
clear that different clinicians using DSM-I or DSM-II would give different diagnoses
to the same patient. DSM-III Task Force members agreed that the specific diagnostic
criteria would be as objective as possible and be based on existing research data rather
than expert opinion whenever possible. _Reliability,_ a biometric concept, refers to the
ability of two observers to agree on what they see. It is measured by a variety of sta-
tistical methods, such as percent agreement, correlation coefficients, or the kappa sta-
tistic, which corrects for chance agreement. The reliability of DSM-III was assessed in
field trials and found to be relatively good, particularly for schizophrenia and major
affective disorders. DSM-III included a definition for mental disorders that has been
incorporated in all subsequent editions, albeit with wording changes:

```
In DSM-III each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant be-
havioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is
typically associated with either a painful symptom (distress) or impairment in one or
more important areas of functioning (disability). In addition, there is an inference that
```

**xxii** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
there is a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction, and that the disturbance
is not only in the relationship between the individual and society. (When the distur-
bance is limited to conflict between the individual and society, this may represent social
deviance, which may or may not be commendable, but is not by itself a mental disor-
der.) (American Psychiatric Association 1980, p. 6)
```
A revision to DSM-III, DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1987), was
published in 1987. Its purpose was to remedy some of the inconsistencies identified in
DSM-III pending the production of a fourth version (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric
Association 1994) to coincide with the tenth revision of the ICD (World Health Orga-
nization 1992). Several new disorders were added (e.g., body dysmorphic disorder),
and others were deleted or subsumed within other categories (e.g., ego-dystonic ho-
mosexuality).
The APA created a task force in May 1988 to begin work on DSM-IV. Because early
drafts of the mental disorders section of ICD-10 were quite different from the descrip-
tions in ICD-9 and DSM-III-R, it seemed crucial for the groups working on DSM-IV
and ICD-10 (then in the works) to have an opportunity for discussion and mutual in-
fluence. The APA had concluded that work on DSM-IV and ICD-10 should be coor-
dinated. As a result, DSM-IV was technically compatible with ICD-10, although there
were a number of specific differences, and coding in DSM-IV remained tied to that in
ICD-9. Thirteen work groups were established, each responsible for a section of the
classification.
DSM-IV was published in 1994, and its development involved systematic reviews
of the literature, secondary data analyses of previously collected data, and analyses
of primary data collected through 12 field trials. Changes were conservative and
driven by evidence whenever possible rather than expert consensus. The goal was to
balance historical precedent, new data, and the needs required for compatibility with
ICD-10. Frances et al. (1990) observed that the “first priority [is] that it be a useful
guide to clinical practice” (p. 1441). A major change from previous versions was the
inclusion of a clinical significance criterion for almost half of all the categories, which
required that symptoms cause “clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.” Several new disorders were
introduced (e.g., acute stress disorder, bipolar II disorder, Asperger’s disorder), and
others were deleted or subsumed by other categories (e.g., cluttering, passive-aggres-
sive personality disorder). Even more extensive field trials and reliability studies
were done for DSM-IV than for DSM-III or DSM-III-R, and they are summarized in
the DSM-IV sourcebooks.
A text revision was published in 2000 (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Associ-
ation 2000). Its purpose was to correct errors and to add new information not avail-
able in 1994. No changes were made in the diagnostic criteria, nor were disorders
added or deleted. The path to DSM-5 began even before DSM-IV-TR was published,
and this story is told next in Chapter 1, “The March to DSM-5.”
The various DSM editions—their lengths and the number of disorders con-
tained—are compared in Table 1.

# CHAPTER 1

## The March to DSM-5

###### 1

## The process to develop DSM-5 (called DSM-V during much of its

development) began in 1999, five years after the publication of DSM-IV. Steven E.
Hyman, M.D., then director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Ste-
ven M. Mirin, M.D., then president of the American Psychiatric Association (APA),
and David J. Kupfer, M.D., who chaired the APA Committee on Psychiatric Diagnosis
and Assessment, met and agreed that the APA and NIMH should work together to
expand the scientific basis for psychiatric diagnosis and classification.
As described by Regier et al. (2011), issues included

1. The basic definition of mental illness.
2. The option of adding dimensional criteria to disorders.
3. The possible separation of impairment and diagnostic assessments.
4. The need to address various expressions of an illness across the life span.
5. The need to address various expressions of mental disorders as conditioned by
    gender and culture.

A conference was convened later that year, cosponsored by both organizations, to
develop research priorities. Participants included experts in epidemiology and genet-
ics, neuroscience, cognitive and behavioral science, child and adult development, and
disability assessment. To encourage thinking “outside the box,” those closely involved
in the development of DSM-IV were not included. Participants recognized the need for
a series of white papers to guide future research and promote further discussion cov-
ering overarching topic areas that cut across many psychiatric disorders. Work groups
were created for developmental issues, gaps in the current diagnostic system, disabil-
ity and impairment, neuroscience, nomenclature, and cross-cultural issues.
Darrel A. Regier, M.D., M.P.H., was recruited from NIMH in 2000 to serve as direc-
tor of the APA’s American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education (APIRE)
and to coordinate the development of DSM-5. Additional conferences were held to set
the DSM-5 research agenda, to propose planning work group membership, and to
hold face-to-face meetings. These groups, which included liaisons from the National


**2** DSM-5 Guidebook

Institutes of Health (NIH) and the international psychiatric community, developed a
series of white papers, published in _A Research Agenda for DSM-V_ (Kupfer et al. 2002).
A second series of white papers, titled _Age and Gender Considerations in Psychiatric
Diagnosis,_ was later commissioned by the APA and published in 2007 (Narrow et al.
2007).
In 2002, APIRE and Director Regier worked with leaders of the World Health Or-
ganization (WHO) and the World Psychiatric Association to develop a grant from
NIMH to implement a series of research planning conferences that aimed to focus on
the scientific evidence for revisions of specific diagnostic areas. With Regier as prin-
cipal investigator, a $1.1 million cooperative agreement grant was awarded with joint
support from NIMH, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
The multiyear grant (2003–2008) supported 13 international conferences. For each,
participants wrote papers addressing specific diagnostic questions, and from these
papers and conference proceedings a research agenda was developed. More than 100
scientific articles were written that were later compiled into monographs. A consis-
tent recommendation was the need for better integration of categorical and dimen-
sional assessment criteria (Helzer et al. 2008). DSM-IV Task Force members had con-
sidered the feasibility of using dimensional measures to assess disorder thresholds
and rate severity. Instead, language regarding “clinically significant distress or im-
pairment” was incorporated into DSM-IV for all disorders, but the only dimensional
component consisted of Axis V (of the multiaxial diagnostic scheme), which provided
for the assessment of global functioning.
The DSM-5 Task Force was created in 2006 by APA President Steven S. Sharfstein,
M.D., and APA Medical Director James H. Scully Jr., M.D., with Dr. Kupfer as chair and
Dr. Regier as vice-chair. Additional members were appointed to the task force, includ-
ing the chairs of the 13 diagnostic work groups that were responsible for reviewing
the research and literature on which to base their recommendations.
The APA Board of Trustees established principles of appointment that required
limits on investments and income that could be received from the pharmaceutical in-
dustry, mandated that no more than two representatives from any university could
participate in the task force or in the same work group, and required a vetting and
review process by a subcommittee of the board. Work group chairs, together with
Drs. Kupfer and Regier, recommended to the successive APA presidents (Drs. Pedro
Ruiz and Carolyn Robinowitz) nominees viewed as leading experts in their field. Task
force members were announced in July 2007 and work group members in May 2008.
The DSM-5 Task Force had four guiding principles:

1. Give priority to clinical utility; that is, any changes to the criteria or organization
    of the manual had to be useful to clinicians.
2. Use research evidence accumulated since the publication of DSM-IV as a guide for
    making changes.
3. Maintain historical continuity with previous editions, particularly DSM-III and
    DSM-IV.
4. Do not establish a priori any limits on changes proposed by work groups.


**_The March to DSM-5_** **3**

Task force members respected precedent and understood that any changes to the
manual would potentially affect clinical care, disorder prevalence, research protocols,
and coding and billing practices. Diagnostic advances would be made through a care-
ful and transparent process involving detailed literature reviews, secondary analyses
of existing data sets, and primary analyses of newly collected data.
The task force was assigned the responsibility of addressing conceptual issues
through six study groups (distinct from the work groups), each delegated to guide the
overall development of revisions for one of the following specific diagnostic areas:

1. _Diagnostic spectra and DSM/ICD harmonization:_ This group assessed the spectra of
    syndromes across existing diagnostic boundaries, made recommendations for the
    overall structure of DSM categories, and identified 11 potential criteria for testing
    the validity of mental disorder diagnoses, representing an expansion beyond the
    original five validating criteria proposed by Robins and Guze (1970).
2. _Life span developmental approaches:_ This group focused on the different expressions
    of mental disorders that might emerge at progressive ages in human developmen-
    tal life stages.
3. _Gender and cross-cultural issues:_ This group was established to assess the different
    expression of symptom equivalence of mental disorders mediated by gender and
    culture.
4. _Psychiatric/general medical interface:_ This group was formed to address approaches
    that would facilitate a better interface between general medical and mental disor-
    der approaches to diagnosis.
5. _Impairment and disability:_ This group was formed to address the development of
    global impairment and disability assessment strategies.
6. _Diagnostic assessment instruments:_ This group considered the need to address mea-
    surement and assessment issues.

Last, a seventh study group was established to review secondary data analyses pro-
posed for funding by the APA to assess the evidence base for proposed revisions.
Work groups met regularly via conference calls and convened in person twice an-
nually. An initial task for the groups was to address how DSM-IV did or did not work
well or otherwise failed to meet clinicians’ needs. For example, work groups evalu-
ated how to better assess symptom severity and how to handle the problem of multi-
ple comorbidities. Other aims included reducing “not otherwise specified” diagnoses
(seen as overused and problematic) and improving diagnostic criteria that lacked
precision. The work groups also aimed to better specify treatment targets to help cli-
nicians identify symptoms that could be addressed in treatment. Additionally, the
DSM-5 Task Force focused on how best to include assessment of common symptoms
not addressed within the diagnostic criteria for a specific illness (e.g., symptoms of in-
somnia that may be experienced by a patient with schizophrenia).
In addition, the work groups were asked to do the following:

1. Clarify the boundaries between mental disorders to reduce confusion of disorders
    with each other and to help guide effective treatment


**4** DSM-5 Guidebook

2. Consider “cross-cutting” symptoms (those that commonly occur across different
    diagnoses)
3. Demonstrate the strength of research for the recommendations on as many evi-
    dence levels as possible
4. Clarify the boundaries between specific mental disorders and normal psycholog-
    ical functioning

Revisions to the diagnostic criteria were developed by each work group based on
a review of research evidence, targeted data analyses, and expert consensus. Summa-
ries of major work group issues were posted on the DSM-5 developmental Web site,
and comments from public and professional colleagues were sought. The final phase
of DSM-5 development included interactions between the study groups and the di-
agnostic work groups.
One goal was to establish a framework for an evolution of the diagnostic system
that would advance clinical practice and facilitate ongoing testing of the diagnostic
criteria. The task force concluded that an important advance would be to incorporate
simple dimensional measures for assessing syndromes both within and across broad
diagnostic categories (Regier 2007).

DSM-V or DSM-5?

One goal of the task force was to designate DSM-5 as a “living” document, meaning
that future changes could be made rapidly in response to scientific advances. Task
force members concluded that the ability to respond in a rapid and nimble fashion
was best captured by the use of the Arabic numeral rather than the Roman numerals
that have been used since DSM-II was published in 1968—hence, DSM-5 rather than
DSM-V. Because technology allows immediate dissemination of information world-
wide, Roman numerals were considered too limiting, especially considering that fu-
ture text revisions appeared likely. For example, a “TR” designation (as in DSM-IV-
TR) can only be applied once. For simplicity, future changes prior to the manual’s next
complete revision can be designated as DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2, and so forth.

Dimensional Assessment

A challenge in accurately diagnosing mental disorders is having the ability to fully
assess a range of symptoms and other factors in patients. Since DSM-III, disorders
have been described and arranged by category, with a specific list of criteria for each
mental disorder. With this categorical system, a person either had a symptom or did
not, and having a certain number of symptoms was required for a diagnosis to be
made. If this number was not met, the disorder was not diagnosed.
The use of criteria represented a vast improvement over the previous guidelines
available to diagnose patients with mental disorders, but categorical approaches do
not always fit with the reality of the range of symptoms that people experience. For
example, persons with schizophrenia often have other symptoms that do not fit the
criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia (e.g., depression, anxiety). Because diagnostic


**_The March to DSM-5_** **5**

criteria require a yes/no decision by the clinician, in most cases there is no method in
DSM-IV to account for the severity of the disorder, nor an easy way to determine if
the patient is improving with treatment.
Work groups were asked to consider ways to incorporate a simple method to en-
able clinicians to capture the symptoms and severity of mental disorders with dimen-
sional measures that would allow clinicians to systematically evaluate patients on a
full range of symptoms. Dimensional assessments allow clinicians to rate the pres-
ence and the severity of the symptoms (e.g., as _very severe, severe, moderate,_ or _mild_ ).
This rating can be used to track a patient’s progress with treatment and can serve as
a means to note improvements even when symptoms remain. Work groups also were
asked to examine the available scientific evidence and determine appropriate dimen-
sional assessments for the specific illnesses under review, and provide clinicians with
specific guidance on their use. Dimensional assessments are discussed in Chapter 20,
“Assessment Measures.”

Diagnostic Reliability and Field Trials

DSM-5 Task Force members understood the need for diagnostic reliability. _Reliability_
refers to the certainty with which it can be predicted that different clinicians will ap-
ply the same diagnosis to the same patient. While diagnostic reliability is rarely if ever
absolute in any field of medicine, it has enormous importance. If two clinicians give
a patient two different diagnoses, one of them is probably wrong. Methods of testing
reliability were developed for DSM-5 to give a more accurate picture of real-world
clinical reliability than did field trials for previous editions (Kraemer et al. 2010, 2012).
Reliability was assessed through a series of field trials; the process included the ex-
amination of specific diagnostic criteria as well as overarching changes applicable
across disorders, such as the integration of dimensional measures and diagnostic se-
verity scales.
The field trials utilized two designs. In the first, a large-scale design implemented
across 11 academic medical centers, approximately 2,000 patients were seen. In the
second design, which was created for solo and small group clinicians in routine clinical
practice settings, around 1,450 patients were seen. The designs provided an opportu-
nity to examine the reliability, clinical utility, and feasibility of proposed changes both
in high-volume research practice settings and in everyday clinical care settings. Diag-
nostic interviews were conducted by psychiatrists and other mental health practi-
tioners, all of whom were expected to use the manual in their daily care of patients.
Interviews were naturalistic and did not employ structured interviews, in order to
replicate what clinicians do every day.
In field trials for prior editions of DSM, the main method used to measure reliabil-
ity was _interrater testing,_ in which two or more raters review the same patient material
at the same time. The design accounts for the “noise” of clinical inconsistency but
does not account for differences in the way patients with the same condition may
present or the fact that the same patient can present differently on different days. For
that reason, interrater reliability testing is likely to render a score that may not reflect
clinical reality. _Test-retest reliability_ was examined in the DSM-5 field trials. This design


**6** DSM-5 Guidebook

requires that the same patients be observed separately by two or more raters within
an interval during which the clinical condition of the patients is unlikely to have
changed, and a kappa statistic is calculated.
Innovations of the field trials included random patient selection with few exclu-
sion criteria; use of clinicians not selected on the basis of special expertise in the dis-
orders being evaluated; application of the entire DSM-5 system in each evaluation
(rather than focusing on one diagnosis at a time); and instructions to participating cli-
nicians that they make diagnoses according to their usual practice, not on the basis of
a standardized diagnostic interview (rarely used in clinical practice). These changes
were made to test with optimal fidelity diagnostic criteria intended for real-world cli-
nicians treating real patients.
Preliminary results of the field trials were presented at the 2012 American Psychi-
atric Association annual meeting. DSM-5 criteria were at least adequately reliable for
most of the disorder studies, while dimensional ratings fared better. Kappa values
from tests conducted in the academic centers were in the “excellent” range for the fol-
lowing: autism spectrum disorder, 0.69; posttraumatic stress disorder, 0.67; attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 0.61; and major neurocognitive disorder, 0.78. The fol-
lowing disorders were in the “good” range: bipolar I disorder, 0.54; schizophrenia,
0.46; schizoaffective disorder, 0.50; mild traumatic brain injury, 0.46; and borderline
personality disorder, 0.58. Other disorders fared less well: generalized anxiety dis-
order, 0.20, and major depressive disorder, 0.32. Although attenuated psychosis
syndrome fared reasonably well (0.46), the 95% confidence interval extended to zero,
suggesting a failed trial.
Although kappa values reported for DSM-III and DSM-IV were better (e.g., 0.59
for major depressive disorder), patient samples were very different in those earlier
field trials in that patients with psychiatric comorbidities had been excluded.

Final Approval

The proposed revisions to DSM-5 had a rigorous and multistage review prior to final
approval by the APA Board of Trustees. Throughout 2011 and 2012, proposed changes
continued to undergo revision with input from APA members and others via three
postings on the DSM-5 developmental Web site. Field trial data was analyzed, dis-
cussed, and integrated into proposals during the review process. A scientific review
committee was charged with reviewing the science validating the evidence for revi-
sions. A peer review process took place in which hundreds of expert reviewers con-
sidered the clinical and public health risks and benefits of making changes from
DSM-IV. The APA Assembly, its governing body, debated DSM-5 and voted to ap-
prove the new manual at their annual fall meeting in November 2012.
Last, there was an overall review by the DSM-5 Task Force, which sent final rec-
ommendations along with all supporting data to the APA’s Board of Trustees for a fi-
nal review. The final draft was approved by the board in December 2012 and
thereafter submitted to American Psychiatric Publishing, a division of the APA. The
official release of DSM-5 was set for the 166th Annual Meeting of the APA in San
Francisco, May 18–22, 2013.


**_The March to DSM-5_** **7**

Controversies Involving DSM-5

The revision process was not without controversy, but this must be placed in perspec-
tive: all prior DSM editions were accompanied by considerable public consternation,
and DSM-5 was no exception. A steady drumbeat of criticism began early, both within
the field and among the public at large.
The main concerns from various critics were that the DSM-5 process lacked open-
ness and transparency; that decisions were made capriciously and did not follow the
evidence; that no independent scientific review was done; that rates of reliability
were unacceptably low; that prevalence rates would increase because the thresholds
for important categories (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mild neuro-
cognitive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder) were too loose; and that
many task force and work group members had conflicts of interest.
Allegations of conflict of interest were spurred in part by an article in an online
journal that implied that the DSM-5 financial disclosure policy had not resulted in a
reduction of conflicts (Cosgrove and Krimsky 2012). The article drew comparisons
with the DSM-IV process (for which there were few stringent requirements to dis-
close) and suggested there was an increase in conflicts among DSM-5 Task Force and
work group members. The APA responded that the data show 72% of task force and
work group members had no relationship with the pharmaceutical industry in 2011.
Of the remaining 28%, 12% reported grant support only, 10% reported paid consulta-
tions, and 7% reported receiving honoraria.
Several diagnostic categories received special criticism. One major concern was
the introduction of the autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, in which five DSM-IV-TR
diagnoses (autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder,
Rett’s disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) were
consolidated. Interest groups led by those wanting to preserve Asperger ’s disorder
were concerned new criteria would relegate individuals with this disorder to the di-
agnostic hinterlands. The decision to remove the “bereavement exclusion” for major
depressive disorder was criticized by persons who claimed the change would turn
normal bereavement into a mental disorder. The DSM-5 attenuated psychosis syn-
drome was harshly criticized by some who were motivated by the concern that the
diagnosis would unfairly stigmatize persons for no reason other than that they might
be considered odd by others or because of their family history, and that it is not pos-
sible to reliably identify persons likely to develop psychosis; furthermore, because
there are no proven treatments for the proposed disorder, the diagnosis would merely
increase off-label use of antipsychotics in a futile attempt to treat it. (The Psychotic
Disorders Work Group later recommended placing attenuated psychosis syndrome
in Section III, “Conditions for Further Study.”) Likewise, disruptive mood dysregula-
tion disorder was criticized for labeling irritable children with a mental disorder that
would also increase off-label use of antipsychotics.
Finally, special fire was reserved for the entire personality disorders chapter (fur-
ther discussed in Chapter 18). In addition to recommending that the number of dis-
orders be reduced from 10 to 6, the Personality and Personality Disorders Work
Group recommended revamping the diagnostic criteria for the remaining disorders,


**8** DSM-5 Guidebook

while incorporating a complex scheme to rate up to five personality trait domains and
25 facets. Critics pointed out that the new criteria were so complex as to be unwork-
able for busy clinicians, and that an already marginalized group of patients would
only be further marginalized by clinicians who ignored the new criteria. The fact that
two work group members resigned in 2012 further fueled the fire. In the end, the APA
Board of Trustees voted to include the DSM-IV personality disorder criteria in Section
II and place the proposed model in Section III.
Despite these many challenges, the task force and 13 work groups pressed on, and,
although the initial timetable could not be followed (the initial plan was for release in
2012), DSM-5 emerged hale and hearty, and probably much improved because of the
intense interest (and input) from clinicians and researchers, as well as the public.

Summary

The process that led to DSM-5 began 14 years ago, and was very much like the process
that led to its predecessors—DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV—by involving the ac-
tive participation of psychiatric leaders and of hundreds of practicing psychiatrists
and psychologists. The process was labor intensive, was open and transparent, and
had multiple layers of review. The task force had declared from the outset that DSM-5
should be transformative, and it held forth on that pledge, creating a 947-page docu-
ment (not including the classification listing and preface) that has introduced dimen-
sional assessment in a more fundamental way than its predecessors, has introduced
many new diagnoses, has consolidated many others, and has eliminated some. To the
extent possible, changes were based on the best scientific evidence, analyses of exist-
ing databases, and new data from field trials.


# CHAPTER 2

## Use of DSM-5 and Major

## Changes From DSM-IV

###### 9

## DSM-5 represents a significant departure from its predecessors,

as indicated by changes to specific categories and disorders as well as its overall or-
ganization (its metastructure). The manual was reorganized in response to recom-
mendations made by the Diagnostic Spectra and DSM/ICD Harmonization Study
Group, convened by the American Psychiatric Association to consider ways in which
disorders might be organized and whether advances in neuroscience, brain imaging,
and genetics might suggest a framework for arranging disorders by more than com-
mon symptoms. What emerged from those discussions is reflected by the reorganiza-
tion of the 19 major diagnostic classes in DSM-5 (Table 2–1).
The pattern of chapter placement in DSM-5 reflects scientific advances in the un-
derstanding of psychiatric disorders and of the presumed etiological and pathophys-
iological relationships among them (Andrews et al. 2009). These changes were made
to facilitate a more comprehensive diagnosis and treatment approach. Rather than or-
dering the diagnostic classes as presented in DSM-IV, developers of the new manual
arranged them in a developmental life span fashion. DSM-5 begins with neurodevel-
opmental disorders, often diagnosed in infancy and early childhood, and progresses
through diagnostic areas more commonly diagnosed in adulthood, such as sleep-wake
disorders.
Within each diagnostic class, specific disorders are arranged so that those typi-
cally diagnosed in childhood are listed first. This revised ordering also represents an
attempt to place close to one another those diagnostic areas that appear related. For
example, the specific class bipolar and related disorders has been created and placed
immediately after schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Another
example is the placement of dissociative disorders between the category trauma- and
stressor-related disorders and the somatic symptom and related disorders. Dissocia-
tive disorders are thought by many to be strongly influenced by traumatic events and
have traditionally been considered to overlap with somatizing disorders. Conversion
disorder, for instance, has long been thought to represent a form of dissociation.

DSM-5 includes three major sections:
```
- Section I covers historical material and describes the development of DSM-5, as
    well as its organization and use.
- Section II presents the criteria sets for the 19 major diagnostic classes, plus other
    mental disorders. Also included in this section are medication-induced movement
    disorders and other adverse effects of medication, and other conditions that may
    be a focus of clinical attention (V and Z codes).
- Section III includes assessment measures, a cultural formulation, an alternative DSM-
    5 model for personality disorders, and criteria sets for conditions for further study.

The Appendix contains highlights of changes from DSM-IV to DSM-5, a technical
glossary, a glossary of cultural concepts of distress, listings of disorders in both alpha-
betical and numerical (by code) order, and a listing of advisors and field trial partici-
pants involved in the development of DSM-5.
The conditions for further study, in Section III, were proposed for DSM-5 but had
insufficient support from the relevant work group(s) for inclusion as disorders. With
additional study, some of these conditions may be elevated to full disorder status in
the future. They are described in Chapter 22, “Conditions for Further Study.”


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **11**

Several new diagnostic classes and disorders are included in DSM-5. The task
force was aware that the number of new diagnoses had increased at a rapid rate in
prior editions, which fueled speculation by both clinicians and critics about the moti-
vations behind the additions. Because it is easier to add disorders than to remove them,
the DSM-5 Task Force set a high bar for inclusion.

Using DSM-5

DSM-5 is large and complex, but users should not allow these features to intimidate
them. Those new to DSM can begin by examining the lists of classes and diagnoses
and studying the guidelines for its use. First-time users should focus on those areas
most appropriate to the kind of work in which they regularly engage, rather than try-
ing to master the entire manual. People may wish to carry the pocket edition of DSM-
5 ( _Desk Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria From DSM-5_ ), which includes the classifica-
tion and diagnostic criteria only, or use its online counterpart, from which they can
easily download needed criteria sets. Users are encouraged to become familiar with
the criteria for a few common conditions (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophre-
nia) and even to memorize a few that they use frequently. The system is too vast to
commit all of it to memory, however, and clinicians should not feel reluctant to refer
back to the criteria when evaluating a patient’s symptoms and making a diagnosis.
The diagnostic process is a crucial step in any patient evaluation and contributes
to developing a comprehensive formulation and treatment plan. Although a descrip-
tion of the patient evaluation is beyond the scope of this book, as part of the evalua-
tion process, the clinician assesses the patient’s chief complaint and conducts a
detailed inquiry about the current illness, past psychiatric and medical history, and
family and social history. With this information, data from the mental status exami-
nation, and laboratory data in some instances, the clinician can develop a differential
diagnosis and circle in on a provisional diagnosis. It is not unusual for the diagnostic
process to continue as additional information is gathered, and for the clinician to re-
vise his or her initial impression.

Purpose of Diagnosis

Critics may downplay or belittle the significance of a psychiatric diagnosis, but the
diagnostic process is fundamental to the clinician’s role and paves the way to treat-
ment selection. Some concern is understandable because the process sometimes relies
on educated (or subjective) judgments and varying skill levels. Some critics deride a
psychiatric diagnosis as a “label,” yet that characterization trivializes the process and
ignores the important functions that a diagnosis serves.
A psychiatric diagnosis helps to clarify the complex clinical phenomena charac-
teristic of mental illness. The broad array of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral ab-
normalities can manifest in various ways, and diagnostic categories impose order on
this chaos. Diagnoses make mental illnesses easier to understand for professionals in
training, as well as patients, families, and friends of people with psychiatric disor-
ders. They also facilitate communication among clinicians because the DSM-5 catego-


**12** DSM-5 Guidebook

ries serve as a form of professional shorthand. Diagnoses also help predict what lies
ahead for a patient because many psychiatric disorders have a characteristic course
and outcome. The diagnosis alerts the patient’s caregivers to potential problems and
complications that may arise. The diagnosis can also serve as a wake-up call to patients
and can lead them to seek help. Additionally, diagnoses are important to psychiatric re-
searchers, helping them assemble groups of persons with similar symptoms and
problems. This research allows investigators to determine incidence and prevalence,
risk factors, and causes of various diagnoses. Diagnoses are also used as the basis for
treatment selection by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and for devising clinical
practice guidelines.

Mental Disorder Definition

DSM-III was the first DSM edition to include an overall definition of _mental disorder,_
reproduced in the introduction to this book. This definition has been revised for DSM-

5. Although no definition can capture all aspects of all disorders, each disorder iden-
tified in Section II must meet the DSM-5 definition of a mental disorder:

```
A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an
individual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the
psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning.
Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social,
occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved re-
sponse to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental
disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that
are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the de-
viance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above. (p. 20)
```
The diagnosis of a mental disorder is not equivalent to a need for treatment, which
involves complex clinical decisions that consider symptom severity, subjective distress
associated with the symptoms, disability related to the symptoms, and other factors
(e.g., psychiatric symptoms complicating medical conditions). Clinicians may en-
counter individuals whose presentation does not meet full criteria for a mental dis-
order but demonstrates a clear need for treatment or care. Access to care should not be
limited just because a person does not show all symptoms of a diagnosis.
DSM-5 makes clear that this definition was developed for clinical, public health, and
research purposes, and that the inclusion of diagnostic categories such as gambling
disorder and pedophilic disorder does not imply that such conditions meet legal or
other nonmedical definitions of mental disease, mental disorder, mental defect, or
mental disability. Additional information is usually required beyond that contained
in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria to make legal judgments on such issues as criminal
responsibility, eligibility for disability compensation, and competency.

Recording a DSM-5 Diagnosis

Clinicians are encouraged to make multiple diagnoses when necessary to fully de-
scribe the patient’s condition. DSM-III and DSM-IV encouraged the coding of multi-


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **13**

ple diagnoses. The DSM-5 Task Force and work groups were alert to concerns about
multiple diagnoses and reestablished diagnostic hierarchies for several conditions to
lessen this necessity (e.g., in the dissociative disorders chapter, the diagnosis dissocia-
tive identity disorder trumps dissociative amnesia and other diagnoses in the class).
Nonetheless, clinicians need to be alert to all of the patient’s symptoms and respond
accordingly. With regard to the personality disorders, the clinician may wish to refer
to the scales that assess personality trait domains and facets found in Section III of
DSM-5 to more fully describe the patient’s condition.
DSM-5 distinguishes between _principal diagnosis_ and _reason for visit._ The former re-
fers to the condition chiefly responsible for a patient’s hospital stay, whereas the latter
is the condition that prompted an outpatient visit, especially when more than one di-
agnosis is given. The principal diagnosis or reason for visit is indicated by listing it
first, and the remaining disorders are listed in order of focus of attention or treatment.
When the principal diagnosis or reason for visit is a mental disorder due to another
medical condition (e.g., psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm), ICD
coding rules require that the etiological medical condition be listed first. In most
cases, the disorder listed as the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit is followed
by the qualifying phrase “(principal diagnosis)” or “(reason for visit).” For example,
if an outpatient with HIV disease seeks care for symptoms related to a mild neurocog-
nitive disorder related to HIV, “HIV infection” is listed first, followed by “mild neu-
rocognitive disorder due to HIV infection (reason for visit).”
If the clinician does not have sufficient information to allow a firm diagnosis, the
clinician may indicate this uncertainty by recording “(provisional)” following the di-
agnosis. For example, the clinical presentation may support the diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia but the patient is unable to provide adequate history to confirm. Sometimes
it is difficult to tease apart the patient’s principal diagnosis or reason for visit, partic-
ularly when multiple conditions (e.g., both schizophrenia and an alcohol use disor-
der) appear to have occasioned the hospital stay or clinic visit.
Several examples follow of how a clinician might record a diagnostic impression
following an evaluation. In these examples, the ICD-9-CM code is listed first, fol-
lowed in parentheses by the corresponding ICD-10-CM code:

```
Example 1: A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by family members
for bizarre behavior including making threats of harm, muttering obscenities, and talk-
ing to himself. His bizarre behavior appears motivated by paranoid delusions. Family
members report that he drinks nearly daily to intoxication and that he smokes ciga-
rettes nearly nonstop. He has had several prior hospitalizations for similar reasons and
has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. His DSM-5 diagnoses are:
```
```
295.90 (F20.9) Schizophrenia (principal diagnosis)
303.90 (F10.20) Alcohol use disorder, moderate
305.1 (F17.200) Tobacco use disorder, severe
```
```
Example 2: A 65-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his worried spouse. She re-
ports that he has been diagnosed with lung cancer, which his doctors believe has me-
tastasized to his brain. He hears “voices” that tell him not to trust family members. He
has become very suspicious and has threatened family members who he believes are
planning to kill him. There is no psychiatric history. His DSM-5 diagnoses are:
```

**14** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
162.9 (C34.90) Malignant lung neoplasm
293.81 (F06.2) Psychosis due to malignant lung neoplasm (provisional)
```
```
Example 3: A 27-year-old woman presents to the clinic for treatment of intrusive
thoughts about a recent rape and recurrent nightmares. Prior to her recent symptoms,
she reports having experienced overwhelming anxiety in social situations. She also re-
ports a history of deliberate self-harm by cutting, relationship difficulties, and aban-
donment fears. Her DSM-5 diagnoses are:
```
```
309.81 (F43.10) Posttraumatic stress disorder (reason for visit)
300.23 (F40.10) Social anxiety disorder
301.83 (F60.3) Borderline personality disorder
```
Those familiar with prior DSM editions know that the manual is for the diagnosis
of mental disorders and does _not_ include treatment guidelines. Nonetheless, accurate
diagnosis is the first step in providing appropriate treatment for any medical condi-
tion, and mental disorders are no exception. For that reason, DSM-5 is the starting
point for clinicians as they begin by conducting a comprehensive assessment of their
patient. Furthermore, DSM-5 can be helpful in monitoring the effectiveness of treat-
ment because the many dimensional assessments included in the manual can help by
measuring severity and change in response to treatment. Despite the absence of treat-
ment information, DSM-5 provides a wealth of information about diagnostic classes
and disorders that learners from all backgrounds will find useful. These are detailed
in Table 2–2.

DSM-5 Coding

Coding is an essential but underappreciated DSM feature. It is used in utilization re-
view, in gathering statistics for public health purposes, and in making decisions regard-
ing billings and collections. Readers may be surprised that the official coding system in
the United States is not DSM-5 but rather the _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification_ (ICD-9-CM), released by the World Health Organization in

1978. This is the result of a treaty obligation to report health statistics using the ICD sys-
tem. DSM-5 and ICD-9-CM use the same codes, which range from 290 to 319. (DSM
codes form a subset of the ICD-9-CM system, which ranges to 999.) Some DSM-5 disor-
ders are assigned the same ICD code, which is unavoidable because the selection of di-
agnostic codes in DSM-5 is limited to those already included in ICD-9-CM. It was
expected that DSM-5 and its new counterpart, ICD-10-CM, would become available at
the same time (May 2013), so that both would employ the same new codes. However,
because implementation of ICD-10-CM is delayed to October 2014, DSM-5 uses ICD-9-
CM codes. Nonetheless, ICD-10-CM codes are shown parenthetically in DSM-5, but
they should not be used until the official implementation occurs.
    The ICD-9-CM code is a three- to five-digit number in front of the name of a DSM-
5 disorder; the code precedes the name of the disorder in the classification and accom-
panies the criteria set for each disorder. For some diagnoses, such as intellectual dis-
ability (intellectual developmental disorder)—formerly called _mental retardation_ —the
appropriate code depends on further specification and is listed _following_ the criteria
for the disorder. The names of some disorders are followed by alternative terms in
parentheses—for example, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)—which in most
cases are older terms for the disorder.
    For each DSM disorder, an ICD-9-CM code is selected that most closely matches
the symptoms of the disorder. For example, the ICD-9-CM code for depressive neu-
rosis is assigned to DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder because that ICD-9-CM con-
cept comes closest to matching the DSM-5 concept. If a category is not reflected in
ICD-9-CM, the convention is to assign an “other” code. These are available through-
out ICD-9-CM to accommodate the addition of new disorders. For example, with bi-
polar II disorder, which was new to DSM-IV, the code 296.89 was selected, which
corresponds to “other bipolar disorder” in ICD-9-CM. For DSM-5 the same general
rule applies to new diagnoses: a code is selected by 1) examining the existing system
and finding a category that best corresponds to the condition in question or 2) assign-
ing an “other” code. Even though the newly assigned DSM code may not be a precise
conceptual match for the existing ICD-9-CM entity, from a practical perspective it
does not matter because insurance companies usually accept and pay for most ICD-
9-CM codes unless the code is specifically excluded by the insurer.
    Some disorders have a three-digit code, although most have four or five digits.
Certain diagnostic codes have a blank in place of a digit(s). In these cases, the user
must insert a specific digit in place of the blank to indicate either a subtype or a level
of severity. Subtypes and specifiers are provided for increased specificity. _Subtypes_ de-
fine mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive subgroupings within a diagnosis and
are indicated by the instruction “specify whether” in the criteria set. For example, de-


**16** DSM-5 Guidebook

lusional disorder is subtyped based on the content of the delusions, with seven sub-
types provided (e.g., erotomanic type).
In contrast, _specifiers_ are not intended to be mutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive
and are indicated with the instruction “specify” or “specify if” in the criteria set (e.g.,
for obsessive-compulsive disorder, the clinician is asked to specify if tic related). Spec-
ifiers provide an opportunity to define a more homogeneous subgrouping of individ-
uals with the disorder who share certain features (e.g., major depressive disorder with
melancholic features). Although a fifth digit is sometimes assigned to code a subtype
or specifier, a majority of subtypes and most specifiers in DSM-5 _cannot_ be coded in the
ICD-9-CM system and are indicated only by including the subtype or specifier after
the name of the disorder (e.g., social anxiety disorder, performance only).

Indicating Diagnostic Certainty

DSM-5 allows various ways for clinicians to specify level of diagnostic certainty, as
shown in the following examples:

```
V/Z codes: Information is insufficient to know whether a presenting problem is at-
tributable to a mental disorder (e.g., academic problem, partner-relational problem).
300.9 (F99) Unspecified mental disorder: Symptoms of a mental disorder are pres-
ent, but sufficient information is unavailable to make a more specific diagnosis.
298.9 (F29) Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder: The pa-
tient is having a psychotic episode, but further diagnostic specification is not possible.
Specific diagnosis (provisional): Enough information is available to make a “work-
ing” diagnosis, but the clinician wishes to indicate a significant level of diagnostic
uncertainty by recording “(provisional)” following the diagnosis.
Specific diagnosis: The clinician has sufficient information to be confident of the
diagnosis.
```
“Other Specified” and

“Unspecified” Categories

In DSM-5, “other specified” and “unspecified” categories generally cover the same
range of conditions as the “not otherwise specified” sections in DSM-IV. The “other
specified” disorder category allows clinicians to communicate the specific reason that
the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific category, followed by the
specific reason. For example, with an individual having one or more hypomanic epi-
sodes yet whose symptoms have never met full criteria for a major depressive or manic
episode, a clinician could record “other specified bipolar and related disorder, with hy-
pomanic episode without prior major depressive episode.” If the clinician chooses not
to specify the reason the criteria are not met for a specific disorder, then the category
“unspecified bipolar and related disorder” is used. The unspecified category is also
used when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Demise of the Multiaxial System

The multiaxial diagnostic system, a familiar part of the diagnostic process, has been
discontinued. Opinions about the value of the multiaxial system have sharply di-
vided psychiatrists over the past three decades, many of whom considered it unhelp-
ful and burdensome. Many simply ignored the system. The multiaxial diagnostic system
was first included in DSM-III and involved the creation of five _axes,_ each of which as-
sessed a different domain of information, as reviewed in the Introduction to this book.
The purpose of the multiaxial system, as pointed out in DSM-III (American Psychiat-
ric Association 1980), was to ensure that “every case [was] assessed on each of several
‘axes,’ each of which refers to a different class of information” (p. 23). The multiaxial
scheme continued mostly unchanged up through DSM-IV-TR.
One goal in developing the multiaxial diagnostic system was to ensure that per-
sonality disorders and mental retardation (now intellectual disability [intellectual de-
velopmental disorder]) were appropriately recognized and were not overlooked by
clinicians whose attention was focused on the more florid disorders that were the pre-
senting problems. Also, medical illnesses were known to be highly comorbid with
psychiatric disorders and were often missed or ignored. The system also was meant
to ensure that clinicians paid attention to psychosocial factors that may have played a
role in the initiation or exacerbation of the psychiatric disorder. Axis V provided a way
to rate a patient’s global functioning, something often not captured in a diagnosis.
From the outset, critics disdained the artificial separation of Axis I and Axis II dis-
orders, pointing to the lack of a fundamental distinction among these disorders, and
decrying the fact that Axis II only further marginalized personality disorders and
mental retardation. Third-party payers took advantage of this situation and often de-
clined payment if Axis II disorders were coded as the primary problem. Furthermore,
in many situations, there was no clear distinction between Axis I and Axis II (e.g.,
Axis I social anxiety disorder and Axis II avoidant personality disorder). Axis III was
never used consistently, and often the distinction between Axis I and Axis III disor-
ders was confusing or artificial. Axes IV and V were criticized as arbitrary and unre-
liable. Despite the fact that the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale was
derived from the widely used Global Assessment Scale (Endicott et al. 1976), there
was little reason to believe the scale was used reliably by clinicians unfamiliar with
rating scales. Further, GAF Scale scores were used arbitrarily by third-party payers to
deny care when the score was either too high (meaning the patient was functioning
too well to need treatment) or too low (meaning the patient was too ill to benefit from
treatment). Finally, no other diagnostic system uses a multiaxial system, which placed
DSM in conflict with the rest of medicine.
These concerns led the DSM-5 Task Force to end the multiaxial system. Clinicians
no longer need to artificially separate conditions formerly listed on Axes I through III.
Instead of Axis IV, clinicians can specify one or more of the V/Z code conditions
(“Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”). In place of Axis V,
clinicians can use the self-administered World Health Organization Disability Assess-
ment Schedule 2.0, contained in Section III and briefly described in Chapter 20, “As-
sessment Measures,” later in this book.

Overview of Changes to

Each Diagnostic Category

This section provides an overview of the major changes made in each diagnostic cat-
egory. They are described in more detail in Chapters 3–19 of this book.

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders is a reformulation of the DSM-IV chapter “Disorders
Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.” There have been
several major changes. First, the **mental retardation** diagnosis has been replaced by
**intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).** There is no longer a re-
liance on IQ as the determinant for inclusion in the category. Instead, subtypes are
used to classify severity of the individual’s disorder as mild, moderate, severe, or pro-
found, while adaptive functioning is given greater emphasis. The arbitrary reliance
on IQ was considered limiting because it does not take into account the different do-
mains of functioning (social, conceptual/intellectual, practical) that allow a more nu-
anced view of the person with an intellectual deficit.
Another major change was the creation of an omnibus category, **autism spectrum
disorder,** for pervasive developmental disorders. Consolidated into this category are
the following DSM-IV diagnoses: **autistic disorder, Rett’s disorder, childhood disin-
tegrative disorder, Asperger’s disorder,** and **pervasive developmental disorder not
otherwise specified.** The change was prompted by research showing that the disor-
ders were not as discrete and independent as once thought, and that clinicians had
difficulty distinguishing them. All persons formerly diagnosed with each of these dis-
orders should have their presentation covered by the new category, and its subtleties
should be adequately addressed by the severity specifiers.
With **attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,** examples have been added to the
criterion items to facilitate application across the life span, and the age at onset of in-
attentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms description has been changed from be-
fore age 7 years to before age 12 years. Subtypes have been replaced with presentation
specifiers, and the comorbid diagnosis with autism spectrum disorder is now al-
lowed.
The **communication disorders** are newly named from DSM-IV phonological dis-
order and stuttering, while **specific learning disorder** combines DSM-IV diagnoses
of reading disorder, mathematics disorder, disorder of written expression, and learn-
ing disorder not otherwise specified.
Other changes to the class include moving **conduct disorder** to a new chapter,
“Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders.” **Elimination disorders** ( **en-
uresis** and **encopresis** ) now have their own chapter. The **feeding disorders** ( **pica, ru-
mination disorder,** and **avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder** [replacing and
extending feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood]) have been combined with
the eating disorders for a more comprehensive chapter titled “Feeding and Eating
Disorders.” **Separation anxiety disorder** and **selective mutism** have been moved to
the chapter “Anxiety Disorders,” while **reactive attachment disorder** has been moved


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **19**

to the chapter “Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders” because of its relationship
with parental neglect.

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Disorders are now generally arranged along a gradient from least to most severe.
**Schizotypal personality disorder** has been listed in this chapter because it is consid-
ered part of the schizophrenia spectrum, although the criteria and discussion remain
in the chapter on personality disorders. The criteria for **delusional disorder** are mostly
unchanged, but the adjective _nonbizarre_ has been removed (Criterion A), and the so-
matic subtype has been edited to ensure that those who are delusional regarding a
“physical defect” are more appropriately diagnosed with **body dysmorphic disorder**
(moved to the chapter “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders”). **Shared psy-
chotic disorder** has been dropped because the diagnosis was infrequently used and
presentations that qualified for the diagnosis generally met criteria for another psy-
chotic disorder. With **schizophrenia,** the special treatment given bizarre delusions
and special types of hallucinations has been eliminated. Further, schizophrenia sub-
types have been discontinued. Although these subtypes had a lengthy history, clinical
utility and predictive validity were poor. **Schizoaffective disorder** has been changed
to provide more guidance to clinicians regarding the total duration of mood symp-
toms. Instead of requiring that they last a “substantial portion of the total duration of
the active and residual periods of the illness” (as in DSM-IV), DSM-5 requires that
mood symptoms be present for the “majority of the total duration of the active and
residual portions of the illness.” Criteria for **catatonia** are described, and the disorder
may be diagnosed with a specifier (for depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders,
including schizophrenia), in the context of a known medical illness, or as an unspec-
ified diagnosis.

Bipolar and Related Disorders

The mood disorders of DSM-IV have been divided into **bipolar and related disorders**
and **depressive disorders,** each with its own chapter. Greater emphasis has been given
to changes in activity and energy in the context of mania/hypomania, with the goal of
improving the likelihood of early identification. Criteria for **bipolar I disorder, most
recent episode mixed,** have been dropped, and instead the specifier “with mixed fea-
tures” has been added that can be applied to episodes of mania/hypomania when de-
pressive features are present and to episodes of depression in the context of both **major
depressive disorder** and **bipolar disorder** lifetime diagnoses when features of hypo-
mania are present. A “with anxious distress” specifier has also been delineated.

Depressive Disorders

**Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder** and **premenstrual dysphoric disorder** are
new diagnoses. The former was added to address concerns about the potential overdi-
agnosis and overtreatment of bipolar disorder in children, whereas the latter was
moved from DSM-IV Appendix B, “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study,”


**20** DSM-5 Guidebook

and given full disorder status. **Persistent depressive disorder** is new and replaces both
DSM-IV dysthymia and chronic major depressive disorder. The coexistence within a
major depressive episode of at least three manic symptoms insufficient to satisfy criteria
for manic episode is now acknowledged by the specifier “with mixed features.”
The exclusion applied to depressive symptoms lasting less than 2 months follow-
ing the death of a loved one in DSM-IV (i.e., the so-called bereavement exclusion) has
been omitted, and bereavement is now acknowledged as a severe psychosocial
stressor that can precipitate a major depressive episode. The authors of DSM-5 felt
that the evidence did not support the separation of loss of a loved one from other
stressors in terms of its likelihood of precipitating a major depressive episode.

Anxiety Disorders

**Obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder,** and **acute stress
disorder** have been moved from the “Anxiety Disorders” chapter to other chapters.
**Separation anxiety disorder** and **selective mutism** have been moved to “Anxiety Dis-
orders” from “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adoles-
cence.” For **specific phobia** and **social anxiety disorder (social phobia)** diagnoses,
changes include deletion of the requirement that individuals over age 18 years recog-
nize their anxiety as excessive or unreasonable. Instead, the anxiety must be out of
proportion to the actual danger or threat, after sociocultural contextual factors are
taken into account. The 6-month duration, which was limited to individuals younger
than 18 years, has been extended to all ages. This change is expected to minimize the
overdiagnosis of transient fears. **Panic disorder** and **agoraphobia** have been un-
linked; each is now its own diagnosis, and their co-occurrence is now coded as two
diagnoses. **Panic attacks** can now be used as a specifier for any mental disorder and
some medical conditions. The **specific phobia** types are now listed as specifiers. With
**social anxiety disorder,** the “generalized” specifier has been dropped and replaced
with a “performance only” specifier. Finally, for **separation anxiety disorder,** the
wording has been changed to more adequately represent the expression of separation
anxiety symptoms in adulthood.

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

This new chapter brings together disorders related to **obsessive-compulsive disor-
der.** Other disorders include **body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, tricho-
tillomania (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, substance/
medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,** and **obsessive-
compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition. Body dysmor-
phic disorder** was moved from the somatoform disorders class. **Hoarding** was listed
as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder in DSM-IV (Criterion 5),
but research evidence shows it to be a distinct condition. **Trichotillomania (hair-pull-
ing disorder)** was moved from the DSM-IV chapter “Impulse-Control Disorders Not
Elsewhere Classified,” and **excoriation (skin-picking) disorder** is new. An insight
specifier for **obsessive-compulsive disorder** allows clinicians to be more precise
about the person’s level of insight: good or fair, poor, and absent insight/delusional


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **21**

beliefs. Analogous specifiers have been included for **body dysmorphic disorder** and
**hoarding disorder.** A tic-related specifier has been added for **obsessive-compulsive
disorder** because the presence of a comorbid tic may have important clinical implica-
tions. A muscle dysmorphia specifier reflects the importance of making this distinc-
tion in individuals with **body dysmorphic disorder.**

Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders

This chapter brings together disorders that result from exposure to trauma or to a
stressor and includes **reactive attachment disorder, disinhibited social engagement
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder,** and **adjustment disor-
ders.** With **posttraumatic stress disorder,** the stressor criterion (Criterion A) is now
more explicit with regard to events that qualify as “traumatic” experiences. Also,
DSM-IV Criterion A2 (subjective reaction) has been eliminated. Whereas there were
three major symptom clusters in DSM-IV—reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, and
arousal—there are now four because the avoidance/numbing cluster has been di-
vided into two clusters: persistent avoidance and persistent negative alterations in
cognitions and mood. This latter category, which retains most of the DSM-IV numbing
symptoms, also includes new or reconceptualized symptoms such as persistent emo-
tional states. The final cluster—marked alterations in arousal and reactivity—retains
most of the DSM-IV arousal symptoms. It also includes irritable behavior and angry
outbursts, and reckless or self-destructive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder is
now developmentally sensitive in that diagnostic thresholds have been lowered for
children and adolescents. Furthermore, separate criteria have been added for children
age 6 years or younger with this disorder. Dissociative symptoms are no longer re-
quired (as in DSM-IV) for the diagnosis of **acute stress disorder. Adjustment disor-
ders** now require distress _and/or_ impairment for the diagnosis, rather than either
distress _or_ impairment.

Dissociative Disorders

Derealization is included in the name and symptom structure of what previously was
called **depersonalization disorder** (now **depersonalization/derealization disorder** ).
**Dissociative fugue** has become a specifier of **dissociative amnesia** rather than a sep-
arate diagnosis. The criteria for **dissociative identity disorder** have been changed to
indicate that symptoms of disruption of identity may be reported as well as observed,
and that gaps in the recall of events may occur for everyday and not just traumatic
events. Also, experiences of pathological possession in some cultures have been in-
cluded as part of the description of identity disruption.

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

This chapter has been reorganized and renamed. Because of the considerable overlap
among DSM-IV somatoform disorders, as well as a lack of clarity about their bound-
aries, the new diagnosis **somatic symptom disorder** replaces **somatization disorder,
hypochondriasis, pain disorder,** and **undifferentiated somatoform disorder.** Most


**22** DSM-5 Guidebook

persons previously diagnosed with somatization disorder will now receive the diag-
nosis **somatic symptom disorder,** but only if they have excessive thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors in addition to their somatic symptoms. People with high health anxiety
but no somatic symptoms now receive a DSM-5 diagnosis of **illness anxiety disorder,**
which is new. **Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions** is a new
mental disorder in DSM-5, having formerly been listed in the DSM-IV chapter “Other
Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention.” This condition and **factitious
disorder** are placed with the somatic symptom and related disorders because somatic
symptoms are predominant in each. Criteria for **conversion disorder (functional neu-
rological symptom disorder)** have been changed to emphasize the essential impor-
tance of the neurological examination and in recognition that relevant psychological
factors may not be demonstrable at the time of diagnosis. **Body dysmorphic disorder**
was moved to the chapter “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.”

Feeding and Eating Disorders

**Pica** and **rumination disorder** have been moved from the DSM-IV chapter “Disor-
ders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” because these
two conditions involve disturbed feeding behaviors. Feeding disorder of infancy or
early childhood has been renamed **avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder,** and the
criteria have been expanded to allow the diagnosis to be used in adults who restrict
their food intake but whose presentation does not meet criteria for one of the eating
disorders. The criteria for **anorexia nervosa** are conceptually unchanged except that
the requirement for amenorrhea has been eliminated. The wording of Criterion A has
been clarified, and guidance regarding how to judge whether an individual is at or
below a significantly low weight is provided in the text. Criterion B has been ex-
panded to include not only expressed intense fear of weight gain or of becoming fat,
but also persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain. The only change for **bu-
limia nervosa** is a reduction of the required minimum average frequency of binge eat-
ing and of inappropriate compensatory behavior from twice a week to once weekly.
**Binge-eating disorder** is a new diagnosis; it was included in Appendix B of DSM-IV.
The criteria have been changed such that the minimum average frequency of binge
eating required is once weekly over the past 3 months, identical to the frequency cri-
terion for bulimia nervosa.

Elimination Disorders

The elimination disorders **encopresis** and **enuresis** are conditions most often first di-
agnosed in childhood. They were previously included in the chapter “Disorders Usu-
ally First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence,” but they now have their
own chapter.

Sleep-Wake Disorders

DSM-5 has removed **sleep disorder related to another medical disorder** and **sleep
disorder related to a general medical condition,** and instead greater specification of


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **23**

coexisting conditions is provided for each sleep-wake disorder. The diagnosis pri-
mary insomnia has been renamed **insomnia disorder** to avoid the differentiation be-
tween primary and secondary insomnia. DSM-5 also distinguishes **narcolepsy** from
other forms of hypersomnolence ( **hypersomnolence disorder** ). Throughout the class,
pediatric and developmental criteria and text have been integrated where existing sci-
ence and considerations of clinical utility support such integration. **Breathing-related
sleep disorders** are divided into three relatively distinct disorders: **obstructive sleep
apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea,** and **sleep-related hypoventilation.** The types
of **circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders** are expanded to include **advanced sleep
phase type** and **irregular sleep-wake type,** whereas **jet lag type** has been removed.
**Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder** and **restless legs syndrome** are now
independent disorders.

Sexual Dysfunctions

Gender-specific sexual dysfunctions have been added, and women’s sexual desire
and arousal disorders have been combined in one disorder, **female sexual interest/
arousal disorder.** All of the sexual dysfunctions (except **substance/medication-
induced sexual dysfunction, other specified sexual dysfunction,** and **unspecified
sexual dysfunction** ), now require a minimum duration of approximately 6 months
and more precise severity criteria. This will help distinguish transient sexual difficul-
ties from more persistent sexual dysfunction. Vaginismus and dyspareunia have been
merged into **genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder,** because the two disorders were
difficult to distinguish. **Sexual aversion disorder** was rarely used and has been deleted.
There are now only two subtypes for sexual dysfunctions: **lifelong** versus **acquired** ,
and, for most of the dysfunctions, **generalized** versus **situational**.

Gender Dysphoria

**Gender dysphoria** is a new diagnostic class, having been moved from the DSM-IV
chapter “Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders.” The new name (from DSM-IV gender
identity disorder) reflects a change by emphasizing the phenomenon of gender incon-
gruence rather than cross-gender identification. For gender dysphoria in adolescents
and adults, a more detailed and specific set of symptoms has been added. The previous
Criterion A (cross-gender identification) and Criterion B (aversion toward one’s gen-
der) are merged because there was no supporting evidence to separate the two. The
wording “the other sex” has been replaced by “the other gender.” _Gender_ instead of _sex_
is used throughout because the concept _sex_ is inadequate when referring to people
with a disorder of sex development. In the child criteria, “strong desire to be of the
other gender” replaces the previous “repeatedly stated desire to be. .. the other sex,” to
capture the situation of some children who, in a coercive environment, may not verbal-
ize the desire to be of another gender. For **gender dysphoria in children,** Criterion A1
(“a strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that one is the other gender”)
is now necessary (but not sufficient), which makes the diagnosis more restrictive and
conservative. Subtyping on the basis of sexual orientation has been removed because
the distinction was no longer felt to be clinically useful. A posttransition specifier has


**24** DSM-5 Guidebook

been added to identify individuals who have undergone at least one cross-sex medical
procedure or treatment regimen to support the new gender assignment.

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

This chapter brings together disorders characterized by problems with the self-regu-
lation of emotions and behaviors and largely replaces the DSM-IV chapter “Impulse-
Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified.” The chapter includes **oppositional de-
fiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial person-
ality disorder** (which is described in the chapter on personality disorders),
**pyromania,** and **kleptomania.** DSM-5 has removed the exclusionary criterion of
DSM-IV that allowed for the diagnosis of **oppositional defiant disorder** only if the
criteria for **conduct disorder** were not met. The criteria for **conduct disorder** include
a descriptive features specifier for individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria but
who also present with limited prosocial emotions. The primary change in **intermit-
tent explosive disorder** is the type of aggressive outbursts that should be considered:
DSM-IV required physical aggression, whereas in DSM-5 verbal aggression or non-
destructive/noninjurious physical aggression also meets the criterion. Furthermore,
a minimum age of 6 years (or equivalent developmental level) is now required.

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

This chapter has been expanded to include **gambling disorder.** The inclusion of this
disorder reflects increasing evidence that some behaviors, such as gambling, activate
the same reward system as do substances and have effects similar to those of drugs
of abuse. _Importantly, the distinction is no longer made between abuse and dependence._
These two former diagnoses are merged into a single **substance use disorder** because
the distinction between abuse and dependence was often arbitrary, of limited utility,
and frequently confusing. Within substance use disorders, the DSM-IV recurrent sub-
stance-related legal problems criterion has been deleted, and a new criterion—craving,
or a strong desire or urge to use a substance—has been added. Severity of the disorder
is specified on the basis of the number of symptoms present. **Caffeine withdrawal**
and **cannabis withdrawal** are new, the former having been included in DSM-IV Ap-
pendix B, “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study.”

Neurocognitive Disorders

The DSM-IV diagnoses **dementia** and **amnestic disorder** are subsumed under the
new diagnosis **major neurocognitive disorder,** although the word _dementia_ is not pre-
cluded for use in the subtypes where it is standard. Notably, DSM-5 recognizes a less
severe level of cognitive impairment, **mild neurocognitive disorder,** which is a new
disorder that permits the diagnosis of less disabling syndromes that may nonetheless
be the focus of concern and treatment. Diagnostic criteria are provided for both major
and mild neurocognitive disorders, and these are followed by diagnostic criteria for
the different etiological subtypes (e.g., major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to
Alzheimer’s disease).


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **25**

Personality Disorders

The personality disorders class is no longer coded on Axis II since the multiaxial sys-
tem has been discontinued. The criteria in Section II have not changed from those in
DSM-IV. An alternative approach to the diagnosis of personality disorders was devel-
oped for DSM-5, and subsequently designated for further study, and can be found in
Section III of the manual (see Chapter 21, “Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality
Disorders”). Other changes to the diagnostic class include moving **personality
change due to another medical condition** from the DSM-IV chapter “Delirium, De-
mentia, Amnestic, and Other Cognitive Disorders.”

Paraphilic Disorders

Paraphilic disorders were previously placed in the DSM-IV chapter “Sexual and Gender
Identity Disorders.” In DSM-5, course specifiers “in a controlled environment” and “in
remission” have been added to the diagnostic criteria sets for all **paraphilic disorders**
(except pedophilic disorder). The specifiers are added to indicate important changes in
an individual’s status. In DSM-5, paraphilias are not ipso facto mental disorders: “A
_paraphilic disorder_ is a paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the
individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of
harm, to others. A paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a
paraphilic disorder, and a paraphilia by itself does not necessarily justify or require clin-
ical intervention” (American Psychiatric Association 2013, pp. 685–686).

Other Conditions

DSM-5 includes additional categories for important conditions and problems that are not
considered mental disorders. These include **medication-induced movement disorders
and other adverse effects of medication** (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, antidepressant dis-
continuation syndrome) and **other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention**
(V/Z code diagnoses). The latter have the potential to cause great distress to patients or
their family members. Although common, the V/Z code diagnoses are underutilized.

Conditions for Further Study

Placing “Conditions for Further Study” in Section III of DSM-5 ensures that interested
investigators are discussing and researching the same condition for possible inclusion
in future DSM editions. Proposed criteria sets for conditions for further study were
first included in DSM-III-R as a way to promote the collection of new data that could
be used to validate new disorders. Few proposed conditions have achieved full dis-
order status, but this method allows the scientific process to determine the outcome.
Some of the proposed conditions in DSM-5 are **attenuated psychosis syndrome, per-
sistent complex bereavement disorder,** and **Internet gaming disorder.**

“Another Medical Condition”

Careful readers of DSM-5 will note that the wording has been changed regarding the uni-
versal exclusion of medical conditions in the differential diagnostic process. In DSM-IV,


**26** DSM-5 Guidebook

the wording used was “general medical condition.” In DSM-5, the wording is “another
medical condition.” In both cases, before a diagnosis can be made, a medical condition
must be excluded as a cause of the symptoms. The change of wording in DSM-5 helps to
emphasize that psychiatric disorders are _medical_ and that as part of the differential di-
agnostic process, clinicians need to exclude other medical conditions as the cause.
This should help learners understand that mental disorders have physical causes.

KEY POINTS

- DSM-5 has three sections: I, which presents historical material and describes
    the manual’s organization and use; II, which presents the criteria sets for the 19
    major diagnostic classes, plus other mental disorders, medication-induced
    movement disorders and other adverse effects of medication, and other condi-
    tions that may be a focus of clinical attention (V/Z codes); and III, which pro-
    vides assessment measures, a cultural formulation, an alternative DSM-5
    model for personality disorders, and conditions for further study.
- The overall organization (metastructure) has changed to better reflect the relat-
    edness of various classes. Chapters are arranged in a developmental life span
    fashion, starting with neurodevelopmental disorders and progressing through
    diagnostic areas more commonly diagnosed in adulthood.
- The multiaxial diagnostic scheme has been discontinued.
- The following diagnostic classes have been added in response to clinical need
    and scientific advances:
    - Trauma- and stressor-related disorders
    - Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
    - Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders
- Several classes have been substantially revised, renamed, or reorganized:
    - Neurodevelopmental disorders
    - Somatic symptom and related disorders
    - Substance-related and addictive disorders
    - Neurocognitive disorders
- Several classes have been divided or consolidated:
    - Mood disorders were separated into two chapters: “Bipolar and Related Dis-
       orders” and “Depressive Disorders.”
    - Sexual and gender identity disorders were separated into three chapters:
       “Sexual Dysfunctions,” “Gender Dysphoria,” and “Paraphilic Disorders.”
    - Elimination disorders have been removed from the DSM-IV chapter “Disor-
       ders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” and
       now have their own chapter.
    - Feeding disorders have been removed from the DSM-IV chapter “Disorders
       Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” and are
       combined with the eating disorders.


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **27**

- Some disorders have been moved to different chapters:
    - Schizotypal personality disorder is now dually listed in “Schizophrenia
       Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders” and “Personality Disorders.”
    - Antisocial personality disorder is now dually listed in “Disruptive, Impulse-
       Control, and Conduct Disorders” and “Personality Disorders.”
    - Separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism have been moved from
       the DSM-IV chapter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Child-
       hood, or Adolescence” to “Anxiety Disorders.”
    - Body dysmorphic disorder and trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) have
       been moved to “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.”
    - Reactive attachment disorder has been moved to “Trauma- and Stressor-
       Related Disorders.”
    - Pica and rumination disorder are now in “Feeding and Eating Disorders.”
    - Gambling disorder is now in “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders.”
- The following new disorders have been added based on clinical need and sci-
    entific advances:
    - Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
    - Binge-eating disorder
    - Caffeine withdrawal
    - Cannabis withdrawal
    - Depersonalization/derealization disorder
    - Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
    - Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder
    - Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder
    - Hoarding disorder
    - Illness anxiety disorder
    - Mild neurocognitive disorder
    - Premenstrual dysphoric disorder

This chapter is a reformulation of the DSM-IV chapter “Disor-
ders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.” The category
was first included in DSM-III, which brought together intellectual disorders (under
the rubric “mental retardation”), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct
disorder, anxiety disorders of childhood, eating disorders, stereotypic movement dis-
orders, and several other disorders. This represented an advance over the earlier edi-
tions, in which intellectual disorders were recognized but other childhood-onset
disorders received little attention. In DSM-I, childhood disorders were subsumed
within the categories mental deficiency, transient situational personality disturbances,
adjustment reaction of infancy, adjustment reaction of adolescence, and adjustment
reaction of childhood. The latter included such conditions as habit disturbances (i.e.,
nail biting, thumb sucking, enuresis, masturbation, tantrums, tics, habit spasms, som-
nambulism, overactivity, and phobias).
The term _mental retardation_ was introduced in DSM-II (American Psychiatric As-
sociation 1968) to replace _mental deficiency_ , and the category was expanded to include
the variety of physical, infectious, and other causes of retardation. The category “be-
havior disorders of childhood and adolescence” was introduced to group together
disorders “occurring in childhood and adolescence that are more stable, internalized,
and resistant to treatment than _Transient situational disturbances_ but less so than the
_Psychoses, Neuroses,_ and _Personality disorders_ ” (pp. 49–50). Included were hyperkinetic
reaction, withdrawing reaction, overanxious reaction, runaway reaction, unsocial-
ized aggressive reaction, and group delinquent reaction.
The authors of DSM-III brought together the intellectual, behavioral, emotional,
physical, and developmental disorders that have their origins in infancy, childhood,
or adolescence. An important contribution was the introduction of the _pervasive devel-
opmental disorders,_ whose most prominent example was infantile autism and which
had been recognized in one form or another for decades but never formally classified.
Also new was the multiaxial system, in which mental retardation was coded on Axis
II. As discussed in Chapter 2, “Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV,” the
multiaxial system has been omitted from DSM-5. DSM-III-R and DSM-IV made fur-
ther changes (e.g., creating a new chapter for eating disorders), but the category of
early developing disorders remained largely unchanged.


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **31**

Several major changes are highlighted in this chapter. First, its placement as the first
class in DSM-5 is a reflection of the manual’s metastructure and its emphasis on the de-
velopmental trajectory of disorders. Second, the term _mental retardation_ has been re-
placed by _intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)._ The revised diagnosis
will capture those individuals formerly diagnosed with mental retardation, but there is
no longer a reliance on IQ as the determinant for inclusion in the category. Instead, sub-
types are used to classify the individual as having a mild, moderate, severe, or pro-
found level of severity. The Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group considered
the term _mental retardation_ to be stigmatizing and no longer helpful. Further, the term
_intellectual disability_ reflects wording adopted into U.S. law in 2010 (Rosa’s Law), and
the term is used in professional journals and has been endorsed by some patient advo-
cacy groups. The term _intellectual developmental disorder_ is consistent with language pro-
posed for ICD-11. Another concern expressed by the work group was the arbitrary
reliance on IQ as the defining feature of intellectual disability, because it does not take
into account the different domains of functioning (social, conceptual/intellectual, prac-
tical) that allow a more nuanced view of the person with an intellectual deficit.
Another major change in DSM-5 was the decision to create an omnibus category,
autism spectrum disorder, that consolidates the DSM-IV categories autistic disorder,
Rett’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive
developmental disorder not otherwise specified. The change was prompted by re-
search showing that the disorders were not as discrete and independent as once be-
lieved, and that clinicians had difficulty distinguishing them. All persons formerly
included in each of these disorders should fit the new category, and its subtleties
should be adequately captured by severity specifiers. This change has been criticized
by clinicians, their patients, and the patients’ parents. Parents expressed concern that
the revised categories might leave their child unable to qualify for educational or
other benefits, whereas individuals with Asperger’s disorder who had developed a
sense of identity felt disenfranchised.
Other changes to the class include moving oppositional defiant disorder and con-
duct disorder to the chapter “Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders.”
Elimination disorders (encopresis and enuresis) now have their own chapter, and the
feeding disorders (pica, rumination disorder, and feeding disorder of infancy or early
childhood) have been combined with the eating disorders for a more comprehensive
chapter on disturbed eating behaviors. Separation anxiety disorder and selective
mutism have been moved to the “Anxiety Disorders” chapter. Reactive attachment
disorder has been moved to the “Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders” chapter
because of its clear relationship with social neglect.
The communication disorders include language disorder, speech sound disorder,
childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), and social (pragmatic) communication
disorder. The term _learning disorder_ has been changed to _specific learning disorder,_ and
the previous types of learning disorders (reading disorder, mathematics disorder, and
disorder of written expression) are no longer included. They are now presented as a
single disorder with coded specifiers for deficits in reading, writing, and mathemat-
ics. Finally, other specified and unspecified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
diagnoses have been added (Table 3–1).

INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES

Intellectual Disability (Intellectual

Developmental Disorder)

The essential features of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)
are deficits in general mental abilities (Criterion A) and impairment in everyday
adaptive functioning in comparison to the individual’s age-, gender-, and sociocultur-
ally matched peers (Criterion B), with onset in the developmental period (Criterion C).


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **33**

Individuals with intellectual developmental disorder may also have difficulties in
managing their behavior and emotions, in interpersonal relationships, and in main-
taining motivation in the learning process.
The diagnosis is based on both clinical assessment and standardized testing of in-
telligence. _Intelligence_ has been defined as a general mental ability that involves rea-
soning, problem solving, planning, thinking abstractly, comprehending complex
ideas, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, as applied in aca-
demic learning and social understanding, as well as practical understanding and ma-
nipulation of objects. IQ is typically measured using standardized tests. With such
tests, the category of intellectual disorder is considered to be about two standard de-
viations or more below the population mean, including a margin for measurement er-
ror (generally +5 points). On tests with a standard deviation of 15 and a mean of 100,
this involves a score of 65–75. Clinical training and judgment are needed to interpret
test results and assess intellectual performance. Factors other than intellectual devel-
opmental disorders, such as associated cultural background, native language, and
communication disorders, may limit performance.
Intellectual developmental disorders are common (about 1%–2% of the general
population), more so in boys than girls. These disorders almost certainly result from
a final common pathway produced by a variety of factors that injure the brain and af-
fect its normal development. Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal
cause of mental retardation, whereas fragile X syndrome is probably the most com-
mon heritable form of intellectual disability. Inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., Tay-
Sachs disease) account for a small percentage of cases. Other factors include maternal
malnutrition or substance abuse; exposure to mutagens such as radiation; maternal
illnesses such as diabetes, toxemia, or rubella; and maternal abuse and neglect. Peri-
natal and early postnatal factors also may contribute, such as traumatic deliveries that
cause brain injury or malnutrition during infancy or early childhood.
Several important changes have been made to this category in DSM-5. The name
was changed to _intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)_ from _mental re-
tardation_ , a term that is no longer used internationally or in U.S. federal legislation.
The name _intellectual developmental disorder_ was chosen to be consistent with DSM-5
as a classification of _disorders_ and to harmonize this diagnosis with the proposed ICD-

11. In DSM-5, IQ test scores and standard deviations from the mean on those tests,
which were included in the diagnostic criteria for mental retardation in DSM-IV, have
been moved to the body of the text and are not contained within the criteria. How-
ever, DSM-5 continues to specify that standardized psychological testing must be in-
cluded in the assessment of persons with these disorders, consistent with the
American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) defini-
tion, but that psychological testing should accompany clinical assessment. With the
elimination of the multiaxial classification in DSM-5, intellectual developmental dis-
order is no longer relegated to Axis II. Removing IQ ranges from the criteria means
that IQ can no longer be used inappropriately to define a person’s overall ability. Cog-
nitive profiles are generally more useful than a single Full Scale IQ score for describing
intellectual abilities, and clinical training and judgment are required for interpreta-
tion of test results.


**34** DSM-5 Guidebook

Both AAIDD and DSM-5 define _intellectual functioning_ as a general mental ability
that involves reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, comprehension
of complex ideas, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience. In
DSM-5, the definition is applied to reasoning in three contexts: academic learning
(conceptual domain), social understanding (social domain), and practical understand-
ing (practical domain). A wide range of skills are contained within the three domains
of adaptive behavior. The conceptual domain involves skills used to solve problems in
language, reading, writing, math, reasoning, knowledge, and memory, among others.
The social domain involves awareness of others’ experiences, empathy, interpersonal
communication skills, friendship abilities, social judgment, and self-regulation. The
practical domain involves self-management across life settings, including personal
care, job responsibilities, money management, recreation, managing one’s behavior,
and organizing school and work tasks.
With the inclusion of severity levels (mild, moderate, severe, profound) in DSM-5,
the focus is on adaptive functioning rather than IQ. Adaptive functioning deficits are
now required. _Adaptive functioning_ refers to how well an individual copes with the
common tasks of everyday life in three general domains (i.e., conceptual, social, and
practical), and how well an individual meets the standards of personal independence
and social responsibility expected for someone of a similar age, sociocultural back-
ground, and community setting in one or more aspects of daily life activities, such as
communication, social participation, functioning at school or work, or personal inde-
pendence at home or in community settings. For an individual with intellectual dis-
ability (intellectual developmental disorder), adaptive behavior limitations result in
the need for ongoing support in school, work, or independent life.

Diagnostic Criteria for Intellectual Disability
(Intellectual Developmental Disorder)

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is a disorder with onset during
the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits
in conceptual, social, and practical domains. The following three criteria must be met:

A. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract
thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by
both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing.

B. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and so-
ciocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without
ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of
daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across
multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.

C. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.

**Note:** The diagnostic term intellectual disability is the equivalent term for the ICD-11
diagnosis of intellectual developmental disorders. Although the term intellectual dis-
ability is used throughout this manual, both terms are used in the title to clarify rela-
tionships with other classification systems. Moreover, a federal statute in the United


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **35**

S t a t e s ( Pu b l i c L a w 111-256, Rosa’s Law) replaces the term mental retardation with
intellectual disability, and research journals use the term intellectual disability. Thus,
intellectual disability is the term in common use by medical, educational, and other
professions and by the lay public and advocacy groups.

Specify current severity (see Table 1 in DSM-5, pp. 34–36):
**317 (F70) Mild
318.0 (F71) Moderate
318.1 (F72) Severe
318.2 (F73) Profound**

Criteria A and B

Deficits in intellectual functions and impairment in adaptive functioning are both re-
quired in order for the diagnosis. For example, intellectual developmental disorder
would not be recognized in an individual with an IQ score lower than 70 in the absence
of significant deficits in adaptive functioning. The person must also have significant im-
pairment in adaptive functioning (i.e., how well the person copes with the common
tasks of everyday life and meets the standards of personal independence in social re-
sponsibility expected for someone of a similar age, sociocultural background, and com-
munity setting). Adaptive behavior reflects performance in academic, social, and
practical settings in spite of intellectual ability, education, motivation, personality fea-
tures, social and vocational opportunity, and coexisting medical conditions or mental
disorders. When adaptive functioning is impaired, performance is limited and partici-
pation is restricted in one or more aspects of daily life activities, such as communication,
social participation, and independent living, at home or in community settings.

Criterion C

_Onset during the developmental period_ refers to recognition and diagnosis before adoles-
cence.

Global Developmental Delay

Global developmental delay is a new diagnosis and allows the clinician to note cases
in which evidence clearly indicates significant intellectual or general developmental
delay or disability, but clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed. The diagno-
sis is reserved for individuals under the age of 5 years.

Global Developmental Delay **315.8 (F88)**

This diagnosis is reserved for individuals under the age of 5 years when the clinical
severity level cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood. This category is di-
agnosed when an individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in sev-


**36** DSM-5 Guidebook

eral areas of intellectual functioning, and applies to individuals who are unable to
undergo systematic assessments of intellectual functioning, including children who
are too young to participate in standardized testing. This category requires reassess-
ment after a period of time.

Unspecified Intellectual Disability

(Intellectual Developmental Disorder)

The diagnosis unspecified intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disor-
der) is used in persons over age 5 years who have significant intellectual or general
developmental delay or disability and who cannot be reliably assessed.

Unspecified Intellectual Disability
(Intellectual Disability Disorder) **319 (F79)**

This category is reserved for individuals over the age of 5 years when assessment of
the degree of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) by means of lo-
cally available procedures is rendered difficult or impossible because of associated
sensory or physical impairments, as in blindness or prelingual deafness; locomotor dis-
ability; or presence of severe problem behaviors or co-occurring mental disorder. This
category should only be used in exceptional circumstances and requires reassessment
after a period of time.

COMMUNICATION DISORDERS

The communication disorders are characterized by difficulties in language, speech, and
communication. While not traditionally considered mental disorders, they can cause
distress and impair functioning in important life domains and are important for pur-
poses of differential diagnosis. The communication disorders include language disor-
der (which combines the DSM-IV categories expressive and mixed receptive-expressive
language disorders), speech sound disorder (previously phonological disorder), and
childhood-onset fluency disorder (previously stuttering). Social (pragmatic) communi-
cation disorder is a newly defined condition involving persistent difficulties in the so-
cial uses of verbal and nonverbal communication. DSM-IV l _earning disorder_ has been
changed to _specific learning disorder,_ and the previous types of learning disorders (read-
ing disorder, mathematics disorder, and disorder of written expression) are no longer
included. Instead, specifiers are used to describe the individual’s impairment.

Language Disorder

The essential feature of language disorder is a persistent disturbance in the acquisi-
tion and use of spoken language, written language, or sign language that is due to


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **37**

deficits in comprehension or production (Criterion A). Language abilities are sub-
stantially and quantifiably below those expected for age, significantly interfering
with socialization, effective communication, academic achievement, or occupational
performance (Criterion B). Regional variations in language (e.g., dialects) do not con-
stitute a language disorder. Symptom onset is in the early developmental period (Cri-
terion C). Other disorders (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental
disorder], hearing impairment, motor dysfunction) must be ruled out as a cause of the
language difficulties (Criterion D).

Diagnostic Criteria for Language Disorder **315.32 (F80.2)**

A. Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across modalities (i.e.,
spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to deficits in comprehension or pro-
duction that include the following:

1. Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use).
2. Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word endings together to form
    sentences based on the rules of grammar and morphology).
3. Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and connect sentences to ex-
    plain or describe a topic or series of events or have a conversation).

B. Language abilities are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for age,
resulting in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation,
academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any com-
bination.

C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.

D. The difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory impairment, motor
dysfunction, or another medical or neurological condition and are not better ex-
plained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global de-
velopmental delay.

Speech Sound Disorder

Speech sound disorder is characterized by persistent difficulties in speech production
that are developmentally inappropriate and involve articulation, fluency, and voice
production in its various aspects. This disorder often coexists with language disorder,
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and neurological condi-
tions such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome.

Diagnostic Criteria for Speech Sound Disorder **315.39 (F80.0)**

A. Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with speech intel-
ligibility or prevents verbal communication of messages.

B. The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that interfere with


**38** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individ-
ually or in any combination.
```
C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.

D. The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired conditions, such as ce-
rebral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, or other
medical or neurological conditions.

Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)

Childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering) is characterized by a disturbance in the
normal fluency and time patterning of speech that is inappropriate for age. The dis-
turbance can manifest as frequent repetitions or prolongations of sounds or syllables
or other types of speech dysfluencies, such as sound and syllable repetitions, broken
words (e.g., pauses within a word), audible or silent blocking (e.g., filled or unfilled
pauses in speech), or circumlocutions (e.g., word substitutions to avoid problematic
words). The disturbance interferes with academic or occupational achievement or
with social communication. Stuttering can also cause humiliation and embarrass-
ment and lead individuals to avoid situations that may be associated with speech,
such as using a telephone. The disorder usually occurs by age 6 years, although most
recover from the dysfluency. Stress and anxiety can exacerbate the disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Childhood-Onset
Fluency Disorder (Stuttering **) 315.35 (F80.81)**

A. Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that are inappro-
priate for the individual’s age and language skills, persist over time, and are char-
acterized by frequent and marked occurrences of one (or more) of the following: 

1. Sound and syllable repetitions.
2. Sound prolongations of consonants as well as vowels.
3. Broken words (e.g., pauses within a word).
4. Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech).
5. Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic words).
6. Words produced with an excess of physical tension.
7. Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., “I-I-I-I see him”).

B. The disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in effective commu-
nication, social participation, or academic or occupational performance, individu-
ally or in any combination.

C. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period. ( **Note:** Later-onset
cases are diagnosed as 307.0 [F98.5] adult-onset fluency disorder.)

D. The disturbance is not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory deficit, dysfluency
associated with neurological insult (e.g., stroke, tumor, trauma), or another medical
condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder.


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **39**

Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder

Social (pragmatic) communication disorder is new to DSM-5. This is a disorder of
children who have difficulty with the pragmatic aspects of social communication, in-
cluding comprehension, formulation, and discourse comprehension, affecting idi-
omatic and nonliteral language inferences in narrative texts and conversation (Bishop
2000). This disorder is unexpected given a child’s relatively intact vocabulary and sen-
tence abilities. Research suggests that such children exhibit socially inappropriate be-
havior but do not have autism spectrum disorder (Bishop and Norbury 2002). Thus,
the pragmatic difficulties they experience constitute a fundamentally different form
of language impairment. Children with this condition display common difficulties in
social communication but not repetitive behaviors or restricted interests consistent
with autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder needs to be ruled out, as
do attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, social anxiety disorder, and intellectual
disability (intellectual developmental disorder).

Diagnostic Criteria for Social (Pragmatic)
Communication Disorder **315.39 (F80.89)**

A. Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication as
manifested by all of the following:

1. Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as greeting and shar-
    ing information, in a manner that is appropriate for the social context.
2. Impairment of the ability to change communication to match context or the
    needs of the listener, such as speaking differently in a classroom than on a
    playground, talking differently to a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of
    overly formal language.
3. Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling, such as taking turns
    in conversation, rephrasing when misunderstood, and knowing how to use ver-
    bal and nonverbal signals to regulate interaction.
4. Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g., making inferences)
    and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., idioms, humor, met-
    aphors, multiple meanings that depend on the context for interpretation).

B. The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication, social partic-
ipation, social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance,
individually or in combination.

C. The onset of the symptoms is in the early developmental period (but deficits may
not become fully manifest until social communication demands exceed limited ca-
pacities).

D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or
to low abilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, and are not better
explained by autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual develop-
mental disorder), global developmental delay, or another mental disorder.

Unspecified Communication Disorder

**Unspecified Communication Disorder 307.9 (F80.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of communi-
cation disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for communication disorder or for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental
disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified communication disorder category is used
in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria
are not met for communication disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder,
and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis.

AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER

Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism was described by Leo Kanner (1948) as a syndrome of social communication
deficits combined with repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and as having an onset
in early childhood. In DSM-III, the disorder was called “infantile autism” and was listed
as one of several pervasive developmental disorders. In DSM-III-R and DSM-IV,
other related disorders were included in the category, including Rett’s disorder, child-
hood disintegrative disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive developmental dis-
order not otherwise specified. DSM-5 now replaces all of these diagnoses with a
single diagnosis, autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder is considered
a neurodevelopmental disorder. Although present from infancy or early childhood, the
disorder may not be detected until later because of minimal social demands and sup-
port from parents or caregivers in early years.
For DSM-5, the diagnosis has been reconceptualized as a “spectrum” that includes
all of the various disorders previously distinguished in DSM-IV. The essential fea-
tures of autism spectrum disorder are persistent deficits in reciprocal social commu-
nication, in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and in
developing, managing, and understanding relationships (Criterion A) and restricted,
repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). Distinctions
among the pervasive developmental disorders were inconsistent over time, variable
across sites, and often associated with severity, language level, or intelligence rather
than features of the disorder. The Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group con-
sidered various options and concluded that because autism is defined by a common
set of behaviors, it is best represented as a single diagnostic category adapted to the
individual’s clinical presentation by inclusion of clinical specifiers (e.g., severity, in-


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **41**

tellectual impairment, language impairment) and associated features (e.g., known ge-
netic disorders, epilepsy, intellectual disability). For example, an individual formerly
diagnosed with Asperger ’s disorder can now be diagnosed with autism spectrum
disorder, without intellectual impairment and without accompanying structural lan-
guage impairment.
The work group made other changes to the category. The three domains in DSM-
IV (social interaction, communication, repetitive/stereotyped behaviors) have be-
come two: 1) social-communication and social-interactive deficits and 2) restricted,
repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities. Research shows that deficits in commu-
nication and social behaviors are inseparable and best considered as a single set of
symptoms with contextual and environmental specificities. Also, delays in language
acquisition are neither unique nor universal, and are more accurately considered as a
factor that influences the clinical symptoms of autism spectrum disorder rather than
as a feature that defines the diagnosis. Requiring that both criteria be met improves
specificity of diagnosis without impairing sensitivity.

Diagnostic Criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder **299.00 (F84.0)**

A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple
contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are il-
lustrative, not exhaustive; see DSM-5 text):

1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal
    social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced
    sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social
    interactions.
2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction,
    ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communica-
    tion; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in under-
    standing and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal
    communication.
3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, ranging,
    for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts;
    to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of in-
    terest in peers.
Specify current severity:
    **Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted,**
    **repetitive patterns of behavior** (see Table 2 in DSM-5, p. 52).

B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by
at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not
exhaustive; see DSM-5 text):

1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g., sim-
    ple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic
    phrases).


**42** DSM-5 Guidebook

2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns
    of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, diffi-
    culties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take
    same route or eat same food every day).
3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g.,
    strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively cir-
    cumscribed or perseverative interests).
4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects
    of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse
    response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of ob-
    jects, visual fascination with lights or movement).
Specify current severity:
    **Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted,**
    **repetitive patterns of behavior** (see Table 2 in DSM-5, p. 52).

C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not be-
come fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be
masked by learned strategies in later life).

D. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of current functioning.

E. These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and
autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of au-
tism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be
below that expected for general developmental level.
**Note:** Individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, As-
perger’s disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified should
be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals who have marked def-
icits in social communication, but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for
autism spectrum disorder, should be evaluated for social (pragmatic) communication
disorder.

**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **43**

Criterion A

The essential feature of autism spectrum disorder is persistent impairment in recip-
rocal social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts. This
symptom is pervasive and sustained. Manifestations depend in part on age, intellec-
tual level, and language ability, as well as on individual differences in personality and
other factors, such as treatment history and current support. For many with this dis-
order, language will be affected (e.g., speech may be absent or its onset delayed).
Communication may be impaired even when formal skills, including vocabulary and
grammar, are intact. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity are clearly evident, and
young children with the disorder may show little or no initiation of social interaction
and no sharing of emotions. An early feature is poor or absent eye contact.

Criterion B

This criterion requires the child to have restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, in-
terests, or activities. For example, the child may prefer rigid routines and insist that
things be done in the same way. The child may have a narrow and intense focus on
particular topics, such as train schedules. The child may exhibit stereotyped or repet-
itive behaviors, such as hand flapping or finger flicking. Excessive adherence to rou-
tines and restricted patterns of behavior may be manifested as resistance to change or
ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior, such as repetitive questioning.
Highly restricted, fixated interests tend to be abnormal in intensity and/or focus (e.g.,
preoccupation with vacuum cleaners). Interests and routines may relate to high or
low levels of reactivity to sensory input, as shown by extreme responses to specific
sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights
or spinning objects, and sometimes apparent indifference to pain, heat, or cold.

Criteria C, D, and E

Symptoms begin early in life and limit or cause impairments in social, occupational,
or other critical areas of functioning. The stage at which functional impairment be-
comes apparent varies by individual and his or her environment. Core diagnostic fea-
tures are evident in the developmental period, but intervention, compensation, and
current supports may mask difficulties at later stages of the disorder.
Autism spectrum disorder needs to be differentiated from intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) and global developmental delay, because the
latter conditions can be associated with communication difficulties. The distinction may
be particularly difficult in young children. The determination may rest on whether
the communication and interaction are significantly impaired relative to the develop-
mental level of the individual’s nonverbal skills, in which case the diagnosis of autism
spectrum disorder is likely.
Children with an autism spectrum disorder may have relatively obvious prob-
lems early in life. Within the first 3–6 months, parents may note that their child does
not develop a normal pattern of smiling or responding to cuddling. The first clear
sign of abnormality is usually in the area of language. As the child grows older, he or


**44** DSM-5 Guidebook

she does not progress through developmental milestones, such as learning to say
words and speak sentences, and seems aloof, withdrawn, and detached. Instead of
developing patterns of relating warmly to his or her parents, the child may instead
engage in self-stimulating behavior, such as rocking or head banging. Eventually, it
becomes clear that something is severely wrong, and the features of the disorder con-
tinue to become more apparent over time as these children fail to develop normal ver-
bal and interpersonal communication.
In young children, lack of social and communication abilities may hamper learn-
ing, especially that associated with social interactions. In the home, insistence on rou-
tines and aversion to change, as well as sensory sensitivities, may interfere with eating
and sleeping and make routine care (e.g., haircuts, dental appointments) extremely
difficult. In adulthood, rigidity and difficulty with novelty may limit independence
even in highly intelligent people with autism spectrum disorder.

ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was first acknowledged in DSM-II
as a hyperkinetic reaction of childhood (or adolescence), characterized by overactiv-
ity, restlessness, distractibility, and short attention span. DSM-III provided opera-
tional diagnostic criteria and emphasized deficits in attention, impulsivity, and
hyperactivity, but included a category for those without hyperactivity. In DSM-IV, the
criteria were revised to focus on two broad groups of symptoms: 1) difficulty focusing
and maintaining attention and 2) hyperactivity and impulsivity. The criteria required
that at least 12 of 18 symptoms (6 from the domain of attention and 6 from the domain
of hyperactivity-impulsivity) be present for at least 6 months, with onset before age 7
years. Subtypes could be used to specify whether the presentation was predominantly
inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, or mixed. Several changes have
been made to the diagnosis in DSM-5. First, age at onset has been changed from onset
of impairing symptoms by age 7 to onset of symptoms by age 12. Research has shown
that estimates of onset by age 7 years are unreliable and that few clinical differences
exist between children identified as having onset by age 7 versus those with later on-
set in terms of course, severity, outcome, or treatment response (Applegate et al. 1997).
Subtypes have been replaced with presentation specifiers that map directly to the
prior subtypes. Examples used in the criterion items have been changed to accommo-
date a life span relevance of each symptom and to improve clarity (Matte et al. 2012).
Symptom threshold for adults age 17 years or older was reduced to five (from six for
those younger than 17 years) both for inattention and for hyperactivity and impulsiv-
ity. The change was prompted by research showing that individuals tend to have
fewer symptoms of ADHD in adulthood than in childhood. Finally, in response to
data showing that ADHD and autism spectrum disorder can coexist, a comorbid di-
agnosis with autism spectrum disorder is now allowed. This change brings the
ADHD criteria into harmony with the revised criteria for autism spectrum disorder.


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **45**

Diagnostic Criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

A. A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes
with functioning or development, as characterized by (1) and/or (2):

1. **Inattention:** Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least
    6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that
    negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities:
    **Note:** The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior,
    defiance, hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older ado-
    lescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.
    a. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in
       schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or misses de-
       tails, work is inaccurate).
    b. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (e.g., has dif-
       ficulty remaining focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading).
    c. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g., mind seems
       elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious distraction).
    d. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork,
       chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus
       and is easily sidetracked).
    e. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty manag-
       ing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and belongings in order;
       messy, disorganized work; has poor time management; fails to meet dead-
       lines).
    f. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sus-
       tained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents
       and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers).
    g. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials,
       pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile tele-
       phones).
    h. Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older adolescents and
       adults, may include unrelated thoughts).
    i. Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands; for older
       adolescents and adults, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).
2. **Hyperactivity and impulsivity:** Six (or more) of the following symptoms have
    persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with develop-
    mental level and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occu-
    pational activities:
    **Note:** The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, de-
    fiance, hostility, or a failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older adoles-
    cents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.
    a. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat.
    b. Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g.,
       leaves his or her place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or
       in other situations that require remaining in place).


**46** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
c. Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate. ( Note: In
adolescents or adults, may be limited to feeling restless.)
d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly.
e. Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g., is unable to be or
uncomfortable being still for extended time, as in restaurants, meetings;
may be experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with).
f. Often talks excessively.
g. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g.,
completes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation).
h. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in line).
i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games,
or activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or receiv-
ing permission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude into or take over
what others are doing).
```
B. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age
12 years.

C. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more
settings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).

D. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of,
social, academic, or occupational functioning.

E. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or an-
other psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder,
substance intoxication or withdrawal).
Specify whether:
**314.01 (F90.2) Combined presentation:** If both Criterion A1 (inattention) and Cri-
terion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) are met for the past 6 months.
**314.00 (F90.0) Predominantly inattentive presentation:** If Criterion A1 (inattention)
is met but Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is not met for the past 6 months.
**314.01 (F90.1) Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation:** If Criterion
A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is met and Criterion A1 (inattention) is not met for the
past 6 months.
Specify if:
**In partial remission:** When full criteria were previously met, fewer than the full cri-
teria have been met for the past 6 months, and the symptoms still result in impair-
ment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are
present, and symptoms result in no more than minor impairments in social or oc-
cupational functioning.
**Moderate:** Symptoms or functional impairment between “mild” and “severe” are
present.
**Severe:** Many symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, or
several symptoms that are particularly severe, are present, or the symptoms result
in marked impairment in social or occupational functioning.


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **47**

Criterion A

The essential feature of ADHD is a persistent pattern of inattention (Criterion A1)
and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity (Criterion A2) sufficiently severe that it interferes
with functioning or development. _Inattention_ refers to problems with the following:
staying on task, being persistent, focusing, being organized, planning, and following
through. _Hyperactivity_ is manifested as excessive motor activity, such as running
about or climbing, or excessive fidgeting, tapping, or squirming, in situations where
it is not appropriate. Hyperactivity may not be continuous, but overactivity may occur
very frequently.

Criterion B

This item requires that several symptoms of ADHD have an onset before age 12 years
because it is difficult to reliably establish precise childhood onset retrospectively (Kiel-
ing et al. 2010). For adolescents or young adults, a longitudinal perspective should in-
dicate that the condition had its roots during childhood and is not of recent onset.

Criterion C

This item requires that several symptoms of ADHD appear in two or more settings.
Although potentially costly and time consuming, and while not a requirement for di-
agnosis, the text recommends consulting informants (e.g., parents, teachers, employ-
ers) who have seen the individual across various settings. For children, teacher rating
scales can provide valuable and adjunctive information as to expectations for norma-
tive patterns of behavior.

Criterion D

In children, ADHD can impair school performance. In adults, worse occupational
performance and attendance, higher probability of unemployment, interpersonal
conflict, and reduced self-esteem are common. Children with ADHD are about twice
as likely as children without a disorder to experience an injury requiring medical at-
tention, presumably due to their impulsivity and inattention. Inadequate self-appli-
cation to tasks that require sustained effort is often interpreted by others as laziness,
a poor sense of responsibility, and oppositional behavior. Family relationships are of-
ten characterized by resentment and antagonism, especially because variability in the
person’s symptomatic status often leads others to believe that the troublesome behav-
ior is willful.

Criterion E

Other mental disorders need to be ruled out as a cause for the symptoms. ADHD
shares symptoms of inattention with both anxiety disorders and major depression. In-
dividuals with ADHD are inattentive due to daydreaming or their attraction to exter-
nal stimuli or new activities. ADHD should be readily distinguished from the
inattention due to worry, rumination, and internal stimuli seen with anxiety disorders


**48** DSM-5 Guidebook

or major depression. Young people with bipolar disorder may have increased activity,
but the activity is episodic, varying with mood and goal-directed behavior. ADHD
should not be confused with mania. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is char-
acterized by consistent moodiness, irritability, and intolerance of frustration, but im-
pulsivity and disorganized attention are not part of the condition.
In some adults, distinguishing ADHD from various personality disorders (e.g.,
antisocial, borderline, narcissistic) may be difficult. These disorders tend to share the
features of disorganization, social intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and cogni-
tive dysregulation. However, ADHD is not characterized by fears of abandonment,
self-injury, extreme ambivalence, or other features of severe personality disorders.
Lastly, ADHD is not diagnosed if the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity oc-
cur exclusively during the course of a psychotic disorder.

Other Specified Attention-Deficit/

Hyperactivity Disorder and Unspecified

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

Other specified ADHD and unspecified ADHD are residual categories for those pre-
sentations of ADHD that do not fit within the more specific diagnostic category.

Other Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder **314.01 (F90.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the disorders
in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other specified attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any specific neurodevelopmental
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “with insufficient inattention symptoms”).

Unspecified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder **314.01 (F90.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the disorders
in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified attention-defi-


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **49**

cit/hyperactivity disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

SPECIFIC LEARNING DISORDER

Specific Learning Disorder

Specific learning disorder is characterized by persistent difficulties in learning and us-
ing academic skills, with onset during the developmental period. Specific learning
disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a synthesis of the person’s medical, develop-
mental, educational, and family history; the history of the learning difficulty and its
manifestation; the impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning; observa-
tions as the person reads or solves age- or grade-level material; school reports; and
scores from individual standardized educational or neuropsychological testing. This
diagnosis replaces reading disorder, mathematics disorder, and disorder of written ex-
pression. Instead, these disorders are now included in a single diagnosis with coded
specifiers for impairments in reading, written expression, and mathematics. The rea-
son for the change was widespread concern among clinicians and researchers that
DSM-IV’s three independent learning disorders lacked validity. This change is partic-
ularly important given that most children with a specific learning disorder manifest
deficits in more than one area. With the reclassification of these conditions as a single
disorder, separate specifiers can be used to code the specific deficits present in each of
the three areas as well as current severity. Specific types of reading disorders are
widely described as _dyslexia_ , while specific types of mathematics deficits are described
as _dyscalculia_.
The essential feature is a persistent problem in learning or using academic skills
as quickly or as accurately as peers during the developmental period (Criterion A).
Thus, the individual’s academic skills are well below the average range for his or her
age, gender-based peers, and cultural group (Criterion B). The clinical expression of
the specific learning difficulties occurs during the school-age years, and therefore
these difficulties may not be apparent until demands on the affected skills exceed the
individual’s abilities (Criterion C). The learning difficulties cannot be accounted for
by intellectual difficulties, uncorrected visual or auditory problems, psychosocial ad-
versity, poor proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inadequate edu-
cational instruction (Criterion D).

Diagnostic Criteria for Specific Learning Disorder

A. Difficulties learning and using academic skills, as indicated by the presence of at
least one of the following symptoms that have persisted for at least 6 months, de-
spite the provision of interventions that target those difficulties:


**50** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. Inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading (e.g., reads single words aloud
    incorrectly or slowly and hesitantly, frequently guesses words, has difficulty
    sounding out words).
2. Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g., may read text accu-
    rately but not understand the sequence, relationships, inferences, or deeper
    meanings of what is read).
3. Difficulties with spelling (e.g., may add, omit, or substitute vowels or conso-
    nants).
4. Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple grammatical or punc-
    tuation errors within sentences; employs poor paragraph organization; written
    expression of ideas lacks clarity).
5. Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation (e.g., has
    poor understanding of numbers, their magnitude, and relationships; counts
    on fingers to add single-digit numbers instead of recalling the math fact as
    peers do; gets lost in the midst of arithmetic computation and may switch pro-
    cedures).
6. Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g., has severe difficulty applying
    mathematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve quantitative problems).
B. The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those ex-
pected for the individual’s chronological age, and cause significant interference
with academic or occupational performance, or with activities of daily living, as
confirmed by individually administered standardized achievement measures and
comprehensive clinical assessment. For individuals age 17 years and older, a doc-
umented history of impairing learning difficulties may be substituted for the stan-
dardized assessment.
C. The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not become fully
manifest until the demands for those affected academic skills exceed the individ-
ual’s limited capacities (e.g., as in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy complex
reports for a tight deadline, excessively heavy academic loads).
D. The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities, un-
corrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological disorders, psycho-
social adversity, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or
inadequate educational instruction.
**Note:** The four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on a clinical synthesis of the
individual’s history (developmental, medical, family, educational), school reports, and
psychoeducational assessment.

**Coding note:** Specify all academic domains and subskills that are impaired. When
more than one domain is impaired, each one should be coded individually according
to the following specifiers.
Specify if:
**315.00 (F81.0) With impairment in reading:**
Word reading accuracy
Reading rate or fluency
Reading comprehension
**Note:** Dyslexia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of learning diffi-
culties characterized by problems with accurate or fluent word recognition,
poor decoding, and poor spelling abilities. If dyslexia is used to specify this par-


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **51**

```
ticular pattern of difficulties, it is important also to specify any additional difficul-
ties that are present, such as difficulties with reading comprehension or math
reasoning.
315.2 (F81.81) With impairment in written expression:
Spelling accuracy
Grammar and punctuation accuracy
Clarity or organization of written expression
315.1 (F81.2) With impairment in mathematics:
Number sense
Memorization of arithmetic facts
Accurate or fluent calculation
Accurate math reasoning
Note: Dyscalculia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of difficulties
characterized by problems processing numerical information, learning arithme-
tic facts, and performing accurate or fluent calculations. If dyscalculia is used to
specify this particular pattern of mathematic difficulties, it is important also to
specify any additional difficulties that are present, such as difficulties with math
reasoning or word reasoning accuracy.
```
Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Some difficulties learning skills in one or two academic domains, but of mild
enough severity that the individual may be able to compensate or function well
when provided with appropriate accommodations or support services, especially
during the school years.
**Moderate:** Marked difficulties learning skills in one or more academic domains, so
that the individual is unlikely to become proficient without some intervals of inten-
sive and specialized teaching during the school years. Some accommodations or
supportive services at least part of the day at school, in the workplace, or at home
may be needed to complete activities accurately and efficiently.
**Severe:** Severe difficulties learning skills, affecting several academic domains, so
that the individual is unlikely to learn those skills without ongoing intensive individ-
ualized and specialized teaching for most of the school years. Even with an array
of appropriate accommodations or services at home, at school, or in the work-
place, the individual may not be able to complete all activities efficiently.

MOTOR DISORDERS

Developmental Coordination Disorder

The essential feature of developmental coordination disorder is a marked impairment
in the developmental acquisition and execution of skills requiring motor coordination
(Criterion A). Manifestations vary with age and stage of development. For example,
younger children may display delays and clumsiness in achieving developmental
motor milestones such as crawling, sitting, and walking, or in acquiring and using


**52** DSM-5 Guidebook

motor skills or tasks such as negotiating stairs, pedaling bicycles, buttoning shirts,
and using zippers. Older children may display difficulties with motor aspects of as-
sembling puzzles or building models.
Developmental coordination disorder is diagnosed when the impairment signifi-
cantly and persistently interferes with the performance of or participation in daily ac-
tivities in family, social, school, or community life (Criterion B). These include
activities such as getting dressed, eating meals with appropriate utensils, engaging in
physical games with peers, and participating in exercise activities at school. Typically,
the child’s ability to perform these actions is impaired, and there is a marked slow-
ness in their execution. Consequences of this disorder can include reduced participa-
tion in team play and sports, low self-esteem and sense of self-worth, and emotional
or behavioral problems. For adolescents and adults, impairment in fine motor skills
and motor speed may affect performance in the workplace or school setting. Onset is
in the early developmental period (Criterion C).
Developmental coordination disorder must be distinguished from other medical
conditions that may produce coordination problems, such as cerebral palsy or mus-
cular dystrophy, visual impairment, or intellectual disability (intellectual develop-
mental disorder) (Criterion D).

Diagnostic Criteria for Developmental
Coordination Disorder **315.4 (F82)**

A. The acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills is substantially below
that expected given the individual’s chronological age and opportunity for skill
learning and use. Difficulties are manifested as clumsiness (e.g., dropping or
bumping into objects) as well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor
skills (e.g., catching an object, using scissors or cutlery, handwriting, riding a bike,
or participating in sports).

B. The motor skills deficit in Criterion A significantly and persistently interferes with ac-
tivities of daily living appropriate to chronological age (e.g., self-care and self-main-
tenance) and impacts academic/school productivity, prevocational and vocational
activities, leisure, and play.

C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.

D. The motor skills deficits are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellec-
tual developmental disorder) or visual impairment and are not attributable to a neu-
rological condition affecting movement (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy,
degenerative disorder).

Stereotypic Movement Disorder

Stereotypic movement disorder is characterized by repetitive, seemingly driven, and
apparently purposeless motor behavior (Criterion A) that interferes with social, aca-
demic, and other activities or results in self-injury (Criterion B). The disorder has an


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **53**

onset in the early developmental period (Criterion C). The behaviors are not attribut-
able to the physiological effects of a substance or a neurological condition, and are not
better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder (e.g., a compul-
sion as in obsessive-compulsive disorder, a tic as in a tic disorder, a stereotypy that is
part of autism spectrum disorder, or hair pulling as in trichotillomania) (Criterion D).
Typical movements include hand waving, rocking, playing with hands, fiddling with
fingers, twirling objects, head banging, self-biting, and hitting various parts of one’s
own body. These behaviors may cause permanent and disabling tissue damage and
may sometimes be life threatening.
Changes have been made in the criteria for DSM-5. Because the term _nonfunctional_
(DSM-IV Criterion A) may be inaccurate, the wording “apparently purposeless” has
been substituted. Because there is no evidence that the disorder must persist for 4 weeks
or longer, that criterion (DSM-IV Criterion F) has been eliminated.

Diagnostic Criteria for Stereotypic
Movement Disorder **307.3 (F98.4)**

A. Repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor behavior (e.g.,
hand shaking or waving, body rocking, head banging, self-biting, hitting own body).

B. The repetitive motor behavior interferes with social, academic, or other activities
and may result in self-injury.

C. Onset is in the early developmental period.

D. The repetitive motor behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or neurological condition and is not better explained by another
neurodevelopmental or mental disorder (e.g., trichotillomania [hair-pulling disor-
der], obsessive-compulsive disorder).

Specify if:
**With self-injurious behavior** (or behavior that would result in an injury if preven-
tive measures were not used)
**Without self-injurious behavior**

Specify if:
**Associated with a known medical or genetic condition, neurodevelopmental
disorder, or environmental factor** (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, intellectual dis-
ability [intellectual developmental disorder], intrauterine alcohol exposure)
**Coding note:** Use additional code to identify the associated medical or genetic
condition, or neurodevelopmental disorder.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Symptoms are easily suppressed by sensory stimulus or distraction.
**Moderate:** Symptoms require explicit protective measures and behavioral modifi-
cation.
**Severe:** Continuous monitoring and protective measures are required to prevent
serious injury.


**54** DSM-5 Guidebook

Tic Disorders

Tic disorders are characterized by the presence of clinically significant tics and differ
mainly with respect to duration and type. The inclusion of five tic disorders—Tourette’s
disorder, persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, provisional tic disorder,
other specified tic disorder, and unspecified tic disorder—represents an expansion
from the four listed in DSM-IV (Walkup et al. 2010). The latter two diagnoses were
added based on research suggesting that tics may result from the effect of certain sub-
stances (e.g., cocaine) or medical conditions (e.g., Huntington’s disease).

Tourette’s Disorder

Tourette’s disorder is characterized by stereotypical but nonrhythmic motor move-
ments and vocalizations. The vocal tics can be socially offensive, such as loud grunt-
ing or barking noises or shouted words, which may be obscenities. The individual is
aware that he or she is producing the vocal tics and is able to exert a mild degree of
control over them, but ultimately must submit to them. Because people with Tourette’s
disorder are aware that their tics are socially inappropriate, they find the tics embar-
rassing. Motor tics occurring in Tourette’s disorder are also often odd or offensive be-
haviors, such as tongue protrusion, sniffing, hopping, squatting, blinking, or nodding.
Because most of the general public is unaware of the nature of Tourette’s disorder, the
behavior is seen as inappropriate or bizarre.

Diagnostic Criteria for Tourette’s Disorder **307.23 (F95.2)**

**Note:** A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization.

A. Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics have been present at some time
during the illness, although not necessarily concurrently.

B. The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than 1 year
since first tic onset.

C. Onset is before age 18 years.

D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., co-
caine) or another medical condition (e.g., Huntington’s disease, postviral encephalitis).

**Criterion A**

The definition of a tic has been made consistent for all tic disorders. The term _stereo-
typed_ has been removed to make it less likely that individuals with stereotypic move-
ment disorder will be diagnosed with a tic disorder.

**Criterion B**

The maximum tic-free interval (DSM-IV Criterion B) was eliminated because there are
no data to suggest that tic-free periods of more than 3 months do _not_ constitute a chronic
course. Also, tic-free intervals are more difficult to assess because they require the pa-


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **55**

tient to recall offset of symptoms, and this may lead to unreliability in diagnosis. DSM-
5 maintains that tics must have persisted for more than 1 year, as in DSM-IV, but it clar-
ifies that the 12-month duration of symptoms is since first tic onset. The phrase “usually
in bouts” was eliminated because this feature of tics is not critical to diagnosis.

**Criteria C and D**

The tics must be present before age 18 years. This requirement helps distinguish
Tourette’s disorder from other causes of tics that occur later in life, such as Hunting-
ton’s disease or postviral encephalitis. Stimulant medication use as an example of a
substance-induced movement disorder is not consistent with the evidence base and
has been eliminated. Cocaine has been substituted as an example.

Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder

The essential feature of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder is the presence
of either motor tics or vocal tics, but not both. This disorder differs from Tourette’s
disorder, for which diagnosis requires _both_ multiple motor tics and one or more vocal
tics. The other features are the same as for Tourette’s disorder, such as onset before
age 18 years. Other disorders, such as Huntington’s disease, need to be ruled out as
causes. The diagnosis cannot be made if the criteria for Tourette’s disorder have ever
been met. The other characteristics are generally the same as for Tourette’s disorder ex-
cept that the severity of the symptoms and the functional impairment are usually
much less. Persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder and Tourette’s disorder
may be genetically related. Clinicians can specify whether the disorder is “with motor
tics only” or “with vocal tics only.”

Diagnostic Criteria for Persistent (Chronic)
Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder **307.22 (F95.1)**

**Note:** A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization.

A. Single or multiple motor or vocal tics have been present during the illness, but not
both motor and vocal.

B. The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than 1 year
since first tic onset.

C. Onset is before age 18 years.

D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g., Huntington’s disease, postviral en-
cephalitis).

E. Criteria have never been met for Tourette’s disorder.

Specify if:
**With motor tics only
With vocal tics only**


**56** DSM-5 Guidebook

**Criteria A and B**

The definition of a tic has been made consistent with that used in the other tic disor-
ders. The changes to Criterion B for persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder
are identical to those for Tourette’s disorder.

**Criteria C and D**

Onset must occur before age 18. This requirement helps separate the disorder from
other causes of tics that occur later in life, such as Huntington’s disease or postviral
encephalitis. Stimulant medication use as an example of a substance-induced move-
ment disorder has been removed. Cocaine has been substituted as an example.

Provisional Tic Disorder

The provisional tic disorder diagnosis represents a modification of transient tic disor-
der in DSM-IV. The DSM-IV criteria were difficult to use because individuals with
current tic symptoms of less than 1 year ’s duration would be diagnosed as having
transient tics when the tics were actually present. Given the need for a diagnostic cat-
egory for persons with tics of less than 1 year’s duration, the transient tic disorder cat-
egory has been renamed _provisional tic disorder._

Diagnostic Criteria for Provisional Tic Disorder **307.21 (F95.0)**

**Note:** A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization.

A. Single or multiple motor and/or vocal tics.

B. The tics have been present for less than 1 year since first tic onset.

C. Onset is before age 18 years.

D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., co-
caine) or another medical condition (e.g., Huntington’s disease, postviral encephalitis).

E. Criteria have never been met for Tourette’s disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or
vocal tic disorder.

**Criteria A, B, C, and D**

The definition of a tic has been made consistent with that used in the other tic disorders.
No evidence suggests that the 4-week threshold described in DSM-IV was valid or use-
ful, so it has been omitted. Onset must occur before age 18; this helps separate the dis-
order from other causes of tics that occur later in life, such as Huntington’s disease or
postviral encephalitis. Stimulant medication use as an example of a substance-induced
movement disorder has been removed. Cocaine has been substituted as an example.

Other Specified Tic Disorder and

Unspecified Tic Disorder

Other specified tic disorder is a diagnosis used when an impairing tic disorder is pres-
ent, but the full criteria for a specific tic disorder or any of the disorders in the neuro-


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **57**

developmental disorders diagnostic class are not met. Unspecified tic disorder is used
when the above conditions are present, but the clinician chooses not to specify the rea-
son that the criteria are not met for a specific disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis. These two
diagnoses replace DSM-IV’s tic disorder not otherwise specified.

Other Specified Tic Disorder **307.20 (F95.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a tic disor-
der that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a
tic disorder or any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic
class. The other specified tic disorder category is used in situations in which the clini-
cian chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet
the criteria for a tic disorder or any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done
by recording “other specified tic disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “with
onset after age 18 years”).

Unspecified Tic Disorder **307.20 (F95.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a tic disor-
der that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a
tic disorder or for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic
class. The unspecified tic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a tic disorder or for
a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes presentations in which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

OTHER NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS

Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder

and Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder

These categories apply to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurode-
velopmental disorder are present and impairing but do not meet the full criteria for any
of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other spec-
ified neurodevelopmental disorder category is used when the clinician chooses to com-
municate the reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria. The unspecified
neurodevelopmental disorder category is used when the clinician chooses not to spec-
ify the reason, or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.


**58** DSM-5 Guidebook

Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder **315.8 (F88)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neuro-
developmental disorder that cause impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-
tant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other specified
neurodevelopmental disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done by recording “other
specified neurodevelopmental disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “neuro-
developmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure”).
An example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation is the following:
**Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure:**
Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure is char-
acterized by a range of developmental disabilities following exposure to alcohol in
utero.

Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder **315.9 (F89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neuro-
developmental disorder that cause impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-
tant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified neu-
rodevelopmental disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific neurodevelopmental
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make
a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- The chapter on neurodevelopmental disorders is a reformulation of the DSM-IV
    chapter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.”
- Mental retardation has been renamed intellectual disability (intellectual devel-
    opmental disorder). Severity is determined on the basis of adaptive functioning
    rather than an IQ score, though diagnostic criteria emphasize the need to as-
    sess cognitive capacity.
- The communication disorders are newly named and include language disorder
    (which combines expressive and mixed receptive-expressive language disorders),
    speech sound disorder (previously phonological disorder), and childhood-onset


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **59**

```
fluency disorder (previously stuttering). Social (pragmatic) communication dis-
order is new and describes persistent difficulties in the social uses of verbal and
nonverbal communication.
```
- Autism spectrum disorder is a new diagnosis that now subsumes DSM-IV au-
    tistic disorder, Rett’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger’s dis-
    order, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Work
    group members believed that there was little validity to the specific diagnoses
    and that clinicians had difficulty distinguishing them.
- With attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, examples have been added to the
    criterion items to enhance use of these items across the life span. Age at onset
    has been changed from before age 7 years to before age 12 years. A comorbid
    diagnosis with autism spectrum disorder is now allowed. Last, the symptom
    threshold has been changed for adults, with a cutoff of five symptoms instead
    of the six required for younger persons, both for inattention and for hyperactivity
    and impulsivity.
- DSM-IV learning disorder has been changed to specific learning disorder. The
    previous types of learning disorders (reading disorder, mathematics disorder,
    and disorder of written expression) have been combined, and specifiers are
    now used to describe the individual’s impairment.
- With tic disorders, the maximum tic-free interval (DSM-IV Criterion B) was elim-
    inated because there are no scientific data to suggest that tic-free periods of
    more than 3 months do not constitute a chronic course.

disorders with subthreshold psychoses (Table 4–1). All are unified by the presence of
one or more of the following five domains of psychopathology: delusions, hallucina-
tions, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and nega-
tive symptoms. Whereas the first four domains are examples of psychosis, negative
symptoms are characterized by the absence of something that should be present, such
as fluency and spontaneity of verbal expression. The term _psychosis_ holds different
meanings, but beginning with DSM-III, the term has had a more restricted definition
that requires the person to experience a break with reality. In the psychoanalytic era, the
term was often used to describe persons who were severely ill and functionally im-
paired but had a broad range of problems and symptoms.

Schizophrenia is arguably the most disabling of the psychoses, yet other psychotic
disorders are also important to recognize and diagnose. These include delusional dis-
order, brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and schizoaffective disorder.
The chapter also includes psychoses that are attributable to other medical conditions
or are induced by substances or medications. Catatonic disorder due to another med-
ical condition has been moved to this chapter and is used for those cases in which the
disorder is medically induced. Unspecified catatonia is new to DSM-5. Other specified
and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders constitute re-
sidual categories that are used to describe psychotic symptoms that do not fit into any
of the better-defined categories.
All psychotic disorders are included in this chapter of DSM-5 except those related
to bipolar disorder, depressive disorders, or a neurocognitive disorder. This organiza-
tion should help facilitate the differential diagnosis of psychotic disorders.
Several important changes have been made to this class. The most basic change in-
volves overall chapter organization. Disorders are now arranged along a gradient
from least to most severe. Severity is defined by the level, number, and duration of
psychotic signs and symptoms. DSM-5 cautions users to diagnose more severe condi-
tions once the lesser conditions are ruled out. Clinicians know (and trainees learn) that
for many individuals the diagnostic process may take months or even years because
signs and symptoms evolve gradually. For example, a young man evaluated for social
withdrawal and magical thinking may have symptoms that initially meet criteria for
schizotypal personality disorder, but several years later he may develop frank delu-
sions and hallucinations that meet criteria for schizophrenia. At the same time, the cli-
nician needs to have ruled out alternative explanations, such as a substance use
disorder or another medical condition, in order to arrive at the best diagnosis.
Schizotypal personality disorder is included in this chapter because of its member-
ship in the schizophrenia spectrum, but criteria and text are found with the personality


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **63**

disorders (see Chapter 18, “Personality Disorders”). The criteria for delusional disor-
der are mostly unchanged, but the adjective _nonbizarre_ has been removed (Criterion A),
and the somatic subtype has been edited to ensure that those who are delusional re-
garding a “physical defect” are more appropriately diagnosed with body dysmorphic
disorder, now placed in the chapter “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders”
(see Chapter 7). In DSM-IV, body dysmorphic disorder was included with the somato-
form disorders.
Shared psychotic disorder has been eliminated because the diagnosis was infre-
quently used and persons whose symptoms met criteria for the diagnosis generally
also met criteria for some other psychotic disorder (e.g., delusional disorder). The es-
sence of shared psychotic disorder is the transmission of delusional beliefs from one
person to another. In the past, these rare cases were called _folie à deux,_ a French term
for “double insanity.”
Clinicians will no longer record schizophrenia subtypes. Although the paranoid,
disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, and residual subtypes have a lengthy his-
tory that predates DSM-I (McGlashan and Fenton 1994), there was little evidence to
support either their clinical utility or their predictive validity (Helmes and Landmark
2003). Because the course of schizophrenia is highly variable, the subtypes had little
stability, so that at various stages of illness it was not unusual for a person’s symp-
toms to meet criteria for different subtypes. For example, a person’s symptoms may
have met the criteria for disorganized subtype early in the illness and then met crite-
ria for the paranoid subtype and, eventually, the residual subtype later in the course
of the illness.
The criteria for schizoaffective disorder have been modified to provide more guid-
ance to clinicians regarding the total duration of mood symptoms. Instead of requir-
ing that mood symptoms last a “substantial portion of the total duration of the active
and residual periods of the illness” (as in DSM-IV [American Psychiatric Association
1994]), DSM-5 requires that they be present for a “majority of the total duration of the
active and residual portions of the illness.” The change was prompted by the low re-
liability of the criterion and its limited clinical utility.
The Psychotic Disorders Work Group had debated the possible inclusion of atten-
uated psychosis syndrome. The syndrome is a collection of symptoms associated
with a high probability of the person developing schizophrenia. The impetus to in-
clude this condition was that it would help to identify those likely to develop schizo-
phrenia, thereby allowing early clinical attention and treatment. The decision was
made to include this syndrome in Section III, in “Conditions for Further Study” (see
Chapter 22) but include it as an example of an other specified schizophrenia spectrum
and other psychotic disorder.

Schizotypal (Personality) Disorder

Schizotypal personality disorder is included in this chapter because of its presence
within the the schizophrenia specturum. Criteria and text for the disorder are found
in the chapter on personality disorders (see Chapter 18).


**64** DSM-5 Guidebook

Delusional Disorder

Delusional disorder is a diagnosis used in individuals who have persistent delusions
but relatively normal psychosocial functioning apart from the ramifications of the de-
lusions and who exhibit behavior that is not obviously odd or bizarre. First included
in DSM-III under the rubric “paranoid disorder,” the name was changed to delusional
(paranoid) disorder in DSM-III-R because while delusions are the primary symptoms,
the term _paranoid_ has many other meanings.
Delusional disorders have a long history. Kraepelin distinguished paranoia from
_dementia praecox_ and used the diagnosis for persons with systematized delusions (but
no hallucinations) and a prolonged course without recovery but not leading to mental
deterioration. Traditionally, the diagnosis has been used for persons who have nonbi-
zarre (i.e., possible but not plausible) delusions but whose functioning is relatively
well preserved, without the deterioration in functioning seen in persons with schizo-
phrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Because these individuals experience their de-
lusional beliefs as ego-syntonic (i.e., consistent with their own expectations, sense of
self, and sense of reality in general), their insight is poor and they generally have little
interest in seeking treatment.
In DSM-5, a number of changes have been made to the diagnosis. The adjective
_nonbizarre_ has been removed from Criterion A. One reason is that “bizarreness” is of-
ten hard to judge, especially across different cultures (Cermolacce et al. 2010). An-
other reason behind the change is more practical and stems in part from a change in
the definition of schizophrenia, in which the special treatment of bizarre delusions
has been deleted from Criterion A. With this change, the presence of a single bizarre
delusion no longer satisfies Criterion A for schizophrenia. Removing the term _non-
bizarre_ from the criteria for delusional disorder was necessary to allow a place within
the delusional disorder category for the rare individual with a single bizarre delusion.
The work group found little justification for differential treatment of delusions based
on whether they are bizarre or nonbizarre. The addition of the “with bizarre content”
specifier allows for the recording of the nature of the delusion and permits continuity
with DSM-IV. This specifier is used when the delusions are thought to be clearly im-
plausible.
Criterion E has been added to rule out other mental disorders, including body
dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition, the somatic
subtype has been edited to delete the phrase “some physical defect.” Both changes
will help ensure that those who are delusional regarding a “physical defect” are more
appropriately diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder, which is now included
with the new diagnostic class obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (see Chap-
ter 7). The work group felt that this change was necessary because people with body
dysmorphic disorder—delusional or not—have a course of illness similar to those
with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and tend to respond to selective serotonin reup-
take inhibitor medications. The changes help to distinguish delusional disorder from
body dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs, and obsessive-
compulsive disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs.


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **65**

Diagnostic Criteria for Delusional Disorder **297.1 (F22)**

A. The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month or longer.
B. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met.
**Note:** Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delu-
sional theme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with insects associated with
delusions of infestation).
C. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning is not
markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd.
D. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief rel-
ative to the duration of the delusional periods.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or
another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disor-
der, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Specify whether:
**Erotomanic type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion
is that another person is in love with the individual.
**Grandiose type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is
the conviction of having some great (but unrecognized) talent or insight or having
made some important discovery.
**Jealous type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the individual’s
delusion is that his or her spouse or lover is unfaithful.
**Persecutory type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion
involves the individual’s belief that he or she is being conspired against, cheated,
spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or ob-
structed in the pursuit of long-term goals.
**Somatic type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion in-
volves bodily functions or sensations.
**Mixed type:** This subtype applies when no one delusional theme predominates.
**Unspecified type:** This subtype applies when the dominant delusional belief
cannot be clearly determined or is not described in the specific types (e.g., ref-
erential delusions without a prominent persecutory or grandiose component).
Specify if:
**With bizarre content:** Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implau-
sible, not understandable, and not derived from ordinary life experiences (e.g.,
an individual’s belief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and
replaced them with someone else’s organs without leaving any wounds or
scars).
Specify if:
The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year duration of the dis-
order:
**First episode, currently in acute episode:** First manifestation of the disorder
meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is
a time period in which the symptom criteria are fulfilled.
**First episode, currently in partial remission:** Partial remission is a time period


**66** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
during which an improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in
which the defining criteria of the disorder are only partially fulfilled.
First episode, currently in full remission: Full remission is a period of time af-
ter a previous episode during which no disorder-specific symptoms are present.
Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode
Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission
Multiple episodes, currently in full remission
Continuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder
are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with subthreshold symptom
periods being very brief relative to the overall course.
Unspecified
```
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psy-
chomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be
rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Di-
mensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,”
this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of delusional disorder can be made without using this severity
specifier.

Criterion A

Delusional disorder requires the presence of delusions for a minimum of 1 month.
DSM-IV specified that the delusions were nonbizarre. Although the term _nonbizarre_
has been deleted, the spirit of the disorder as involving persons with nonbizarre de-
lusions remains, as indicated by the various subtypes. Individuals with schizophre-
nia often have very bizarre delusions not possible in real life. For example, we have
had patients claim they are being controlled by radio transmitters implanted in their
brains (although with rapidly developing technology, that situation may be possible
in the future).

Criterion B

Excluding symptoms that meet Criterion A of schizophrenia has helped to separate de-
lusional disorder from schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia have other psychotic
symptoms (hallucinations; disorganized speech; grossly abnormal behavior, including
catatonia) in addition to negative symptoms. Although individuals with delusional dis-
order may have tactile and olfactory hallucinations that relate to their delusion, they are
otherwise free of those symptoms common to persons with schizophrenia (e.g., audi-
tory hallucinations). For example, individuals with delusional disorder, somatic type,
may have delusions of being infested with parasites and report feeling them moving
about under their skin. (This particular delusion has been referred to as _delusional para-
sitosis_ and is more commonly seen by dermatologists.)


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **67**

Criterion C

People with delusional disorder do not behave in an obviously odd or bizarre fash-
ion. This is an important distinction from people with schizophrenia, who often act in
strange ways, such as muttering to themselves, wearing dirty or inappropriate cloth-
ing, or accosting strangers. The purpose of this criterion is to ensure that delusional
disorder is restricted to persons who, apart from their delusion or its ramifications,
are able to function. That said, the behavior of some persons is greatly influenced by
their delusions, and this can be reflected in their actions. For example, a person in love
with a television actress may attempt to contact the person, or in rare cases may stalk
her. A person who thinks his wife is unfaithful may read her private e-mail or monitor
her daily activities in an attempt to catch her with the paramour.

Criterion D

If persons with delusional disorder have had concurrent mood episodes, these epi-
sodes must have been relatively brief. The goal is to separate delusional disorder from
psychotic forms of major depressive disorder. Individuals with the latter may de-
velop delusions in the context of suffering severe depression, but these delusions tend
to have depressive content, such as believing oneself to have committed a sinful act
or to have lost all of one’s savings. If the delusions occur exclusively during the course
of the depressive illness, the diagnosis is a mood disorder with psychotic features.
Individuals with delusional disorder often have significant depressive symptoms.
The clinician may feel that the symptoms merit an independent diagnosis of major
depressive disorder or other specified or unspecified depressive disorder (or if there
is a bipolar course, other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder).
Schizoaffective disorder is another diagnostic possibility if the delusions are long-
standing and the mood disorder is severe.

Criterion E

This criterion excludes delusional disorders attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance or another medical condition or are better explained by another mental
disorder. Delusions can result from a variety of medical illnesses, certain medical treat-
ments or medications (e.g., corticosteroids), and use of drugs of abuse (e.g., stimu-
lants). This criterion requires ruling out neurocognitive disorders, such as a dementia,
as well as traumatic brain injuries or a convulsive disorder. Also, certain forms of body
dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder are relatively severe and are
associated with delusions (e.g., when an individual believes his normal-appearing
nose is ugly and misshapen). Even when the belief reaches delusional proportions, the
diagnosis body dysmorphic disorder is more appropriate than delusional disorder.

Subtypes and Specifiers

Subtypes are used to indicate the specific theme the disorder has taken, such as ero-
tomania or grandiosity. Bizarreness, course of the disorder, and current severity can
also be specified.


**68** DSM-5 Guidebook

Brief Psychotic Disorder

Brief psychotic disorder is a diagnosis used for relatively brief episodes of psychosis
lasting at least 1 day but less than 1 month. The disorder is relatively uncommon and
occurs in persons who otherwise have not experienced a decline in their day-to-day
functioning or who display signs that in retrospect suggest the prodrome of schizo-
phrenia. Further, the psychotic symptoms associated with this diagnosis tend to be
brought on by stressful situations or acute mood changes. In the past, this diagnosis
was often referred to as a reactive, hysterical, or psychogenic psychosis. The diagno-
sis is essentially unchanged from DSM-IV except for minor editing and the addition
of the specifiers for catatonia and current severity.
Some individuals report new-onset psychotic symptoms that last minutes to hours
and that therefore do not qualify for the diagnosis. These symptoms can occur in per-
sons with borderline personality disorder or schizotypal personality disorder; in
these cases no additional diagnosis is necessary. Otherwise, when these short-lived
symptoms occur, and they are not attributable to a medication, a drug of abuse, or an-
other medical condition, the diagnosis other specified or unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder may be appropriate.

Diagnostic Criteria for Brief Psychotic Disorder **298.8 (F23)**

A. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms. At least one of these must
be (1), (2), or (3):

1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
**Note:** Do not include a symptom if it is a culturally sanctioned response.
B. Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less than 1 month,
with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or bipolar disorder
with psychotic features or another psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or
catatonia, and is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

Specify if:
**With marked stressor(s)** (brief reactive psychosis): If symptoms occur in re-
sponse to events that, singly or together, would be markedly stressful to almost
anyone in similar circumstances in the individual’s culture.
**Without marked stressor(s):** If symptoms do not occur in response to events
that, singly or together, would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar
circumstances in the individual’s culture.
**With postpartum onset:** If onset is during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum.
Specify if:
**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental
disorder, DSM-5, pp. 119–120, for definition)


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **69**

```
Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with
brief psychotic disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia.
```
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psy-
chomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be
rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Di-
mensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,”
this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder can be made without using this se-
verity specifier.

Criterion A

Psychotic symptoms must be present, and the Criterion A list for brief psychotic dis-
order replicates that for schizophrenia _except_ that negative symptoms are not in-
cluded; these usually occur over long periods of time and do not generally present
acutely. The diagnosis does not apply when the psychotic symptoms appear to have
developed in response to culturally sanctioned activities, such as _Qigong,_ a Chinese
health-enhancing practice that can reportedly lead to transient psychosis. This is an
important consideration, because psychotic-like phenomena are reported to occur
during extended religious or ceremonial rituals in several non-Western cultures.

Criterion B

The disturbance lasts at least 1 day but less than 1 month. If the duration is longer, the
person will presumably qualify for another diagnosis, such as schizophreniform dis-
order.

Criterion C

The language has been edited for consistency within DSM-5, but otherwise this crite-
rion is unchanged from DSM-IV. Mood disorders, other psychotic disorders, medical
conditions, and the physiological effects of substances need to be ruled out as a cause
of the disturbance.

Specifiers

When the disorder occurs in response to stressors, the clinician can use the specifier
“with marked stressor(s).” If brief psychotic disorder occurs within 4 weeks postpar-
tum, the “with postpartum onset” specifier is appropriate. Typically, women with
postpartum onset generally develop symptoms within 1–2 weeks of delivery. Symp-
toms can include disorganized speech, misperceptions, labile mood, confusion, and
hallucinations. Frequently referred to as “postpartum psychosis,” the disorder tends
to arise in otherwise normally functioning individuals. The disorder should be distin-


**70** DSM-5 Guidebook

guished from the “baby blues,” which occurs in many new mothers and may last for
a few days after delivery but is not considered pathologic. The new specifier “with
catatonia” can be used when the full syndrome is present. Current severity can be
specified as well.

Schizophreniform Disorder

The term _schizophreniform_ was used by Gabriel Langfeldt (1939) to describe acute psy-
choses that were reactive and occurred in persons with relatively normal person-
alities. Such cases were referred to as “acute schizophrenic episodes” in DSM-II.
Schizophreniform disorder was formally recognized in DSM-III as one of several psy-
chotic disorders not elsewhere classified. The diagnosis is used for symptoms of
schizophrenia that last at least 1 month but less than 6 months. Once the symptoms
have lasted 6 months or longer, the diagnosis changes to schizophrenia, even if only
residual symptoms remain (e.g., blunted affect).
The validity of schizophreniform disorder has been debated. Some individuals di-
agnosed with this disorder develop schizophrenia, whereas others develop a mood
disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Persons with schizophreniform disorder have a
relatively better prognosis than those diagnosed with schizophrenia at first encounter.

Diagnostic Criteria for Schizophreniform Disorder **295.40 (F20.81)**

A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time dur-
ing a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must
be (1), (2), or (3):

1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition).
B. An episode of the disorder lasts at least 1 month but less than 6 months. When
the diagnosis must be made without waiting for recovery, it should be qualified
as “provisional.”
C. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic fea-
tures have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic epi-
sodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood
episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present
for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance
(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

Specify if:
**With good prognostic features:** This specifier requires the presence of at least
two of the following features: onset of prominent psychotic symptoms within 4
weeks of the first noticeable change in usual behavior or functioning; confusion


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **71**

```
or perplexity; good premorbid social and occupational functioning; and absence
of blunted or flat affect.
Without good prognostic features: This specifier is applied if two or more of
the above features have not been present.
```
Specify if:
**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental
disorder, DSM-5, pp. 119–120, for definition).
**Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with
schizophreniform disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia.

Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psy-
chomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be
rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Di-
mensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,”
this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder can be made without using this
severity specifier.

The criteria require that the individual’s symptoms meet schizophrenia Criterion
A (psychotic symptoms), as well as schizophrenia Criteria D and E (which require
that other mental disorders, substances of abuse, and other medical disorders have
been ruled out as a cause of the disorder). Because the individual would have new-
onset symptoms, alternative explanations need to be ruled out during a comprehen-
sive evaluation.
The clinician should specify whether the individual has good prognostic features,
such as acute onset, confusion or perplexity, good premorbid functioning, and ab-
sence of a flattened affect—all of which are symptoms identified in research studies
as correlating with good prognosis. Catatonic features should be specified if present.
Current severity can also be specified.

Schizophrenia

In DSM-5, schizophrenia is defined by a group of characteristic symptoms, such as
delusions, hallucinations, and negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expres-
sion or avolition); deterioration in social, occupational, or interpersonal functioning;
and continuous signs of the disturbance for at least 6 months. No symptoms are spe-
cific—or pathognomonic—to schizophrenia, complicating the task of establishing the
proper boundaries for the disorder.
Kraepelin (1919) is generally credited for producing the first coherent definition
of schizophrenia, which he called _dementia praecox._ His conceptualization was of an
early-onset illness characterized by psychotic symptoms with a chronic and deterio-
rating course. He was also instrumental in separating dementia praecox from manic-
depressive illness, which had its onset throughout life and had a more episodic course.


**72** DSM-5 Guidebook

Kraepelin’s emphasis on psychotic symptoms and a deteriorating course helped to iden-
tify a relatively narrow group of severely ill patients with chronic symptoms and poor
prognosis.
_Dementia praecox_ was eventually renamed _schizophrenia_ by Bleuler (1950) in 1911 to
emphasize the cognitive impairment that occurs, which he saw as a “splitting” of the
psychic processes. Bleuler maintained that certain symptoms were fundamental to the
illness, including affective blunting, disturbance of association (i.e., peculiar and dis-
torted thinking), autism, and indecisiveness (ambivalence). He de-emphasized course
and regarded delusions and hallucinations as accessory symptoms because they could
occur in other disorders. Bleuler ’s ideas earned acceptance and guided the practice of
generations of American and European psychiatrists who were taught the importance
of Bleuler’s fundamental symptoms (“the four A’s”). Because these symptoms were im-
precise, they defined a much more heterogeneous group of patients, often much less ill
than those identified by Kraepelin, and contributed to an increasingly broad concept of
schizophrenia.
The ideas of Kurt Schneider (1959) helped reshape the concept of schizophrenia
into that of a relatively severe psychotic disorder, bringing it back to the original ideas
of Kraepelin. He described “first-rank” psychotic symptoms that he believed were
relatively specific and that thus helped to discriminate schizophrenia from other dis-
orders. These symptoms included thought insertion, thought withdrawal, thought
broadcasting, voices communicating with (or about) the person, and delusions of be-
ing externally controlled (i.e., delusions of passivity). Schneider’s description of
schizophrenia emphasized the presence of one or more of these psychotic symptoms
and was cross-sectional in its definition of the illness. Although later research sug-
gested that these “Schneiderian” symptoms were not particularly specific (Nor-
dgaard et al. 2008), Schneider’s ideas gained prominence and influenced DSM-III,
DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV with their special treatment of “bizarre” delusions and cer-
tain hallucinations.
With DSM-5, modest changes have been made in the criteria for schizophrenia.
The main change has been to eliminate the special status of Schneiderian first-rank
symptoms, including bizarre delusions and certain hallucinations such as voices con-
versing. The recommendation was also made to eliminate schizophrenia subtypes.
Work group members agreed that the classic subtypes provided a poor description of
the heterogeneity of the disorder and had low diagnostic stability, with only the par-
anoid and undifferentiated subtypes being used with any frequency.

Diagnostic Criteria for Schizophrenia **295.90 (F20.9)**

A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during
a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1),
(2), or (3):

1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **73**

3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition).

B. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of func-
tioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-
care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is
in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interper-
sonal, academic, or occupational functioning).
C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month pe-
riod must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that
meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodro-
mal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs
of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or
more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd be-
liefs, unusual perceptual experiences).
D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features
have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes
have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood epi-
sodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for
a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of
childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if promi-
nent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of
schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully
treated).

Specify if:
The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year duration of the dis-
order and if they are not in contradiction to the diagnostic course criteria.
**First episode, currently in acute episode:** First manifestation of the disorder
meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is
a time period in which the symptom criteria are fulfilled.
**First episode, currently in partial remission:** Partial remission is a period of
time during which an improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in
which the defining criteria of the disorder are only partially fulfilled.

**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental
disorder, DSM-5, pp. 119–120, for definition).
**Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with

Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psy-
chomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be
rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Di-
mensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,”
this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of schizophrenia can be made without using this severity spec-
ifier.

Criterion A

At least one of the two required symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or dis-
organized speech. These three are core “positive symptoms” that are diagnosed with
high reliability and might reasonably be considered necessary for a diagnosis of
schizophrenia. In DSM-IV, only one characteristic symptom was required if it was a
bizarre delusion or “first-rank” hallucination. Because bizarre delusions and first-
rank hallucinations have little diagnostic specificity and their reliability is poor (Bell
et al. 2006), these “positive symptoms” are now treated like any other with regard to
their diagnostic implication: as with other characteristic symptoms, two Criterion A
symptoms need to be present for a diagnosis of schizophrenia. This change also elim-
inates the possibility that an individual with only catatonia and negative symptoms
will receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
To better describe the nature of the affective abnormality in schizophrenia, the fifth
characteristic type of symptoms in Criterion A—negative symptoms—has been changed
from “affective flattening, alogia, or avolition” (as in DSM-IV) to “diminished emo-
tional expression or avolition.” This change to emphasize restricted affect should help
clarify and more accurately describe the individual’s presentation.

Criterion B

Schizophrenia involves impairment in one or more major areas of functioning. Typi-
cally, functioning is clearly below prior levels of achievement, or, if the disturbance
begins in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of functioning is not attained.

Criterion C

Signs of the disturbance must persist continuously for at least 6 months. During at least
1 month of that time, symptoms must meet Criterion A (active-phase symptoms). Pro-
dromal symptoms often proceed the active phase, and residual symptoms may follow.


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **75**

Some prodromal and residual symptoms are mild or subthreshold forms of hallucina-
tions or delusions. Individuals may express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are
not of delusional proportions; these are often referred to as “magical thinking” or “ideas
of reference.” The individual may report having unusual perceptual experiences, such
as sensing the presence of an unseen person. The person’s speech may be generally un-
derstandable but vague or digressive, while his or her behavior may be unusual but not
grossly disorganized, such as muttering to oneself in public. Negative symptoms are
common in the prodromal and residual phases and can be severe.

Criterion D

Although mood symptoms and mood episodes are common and may be concurrent
with active-phase symptoms, individuals with schizophrenia must have delusions or
hallucinations in the absence of mood episodes, or the total duration of the mood ep-
isodes must be present for only a minority of the total duration of the active and re-
sidual periods of the illness. Otherwise, schizoaffective disorder may be the more
appropriate diagnosis.

Criterion E

Before making a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the clinician must rule out a wide variety
of medical conditions that can present with psychotic symptoms, and must exclude
drug-induced psychoses and psychoses attributable to delirium or other medical con-
ditions (e.g., epilepsy, brain tumors, inflammatory brain disorders).

Criterion F

If the individual has a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication dis-
order of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if
prominent delusions or hallucinations, and the other required symptoms of schizo-
phrenia, have been present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).

Specifiers

Multiple specifiers are provided to better describe the individual’s course of illness.
Catatonia may be specified if the full syndrome is present. Catatonic behaviors that
may have previously led to the diagnosis of a catatonic subtype of schizophrenia are
now covered in Criterion A4, which involves the presence of “grossly disorganized
or catatonic behavior.” The following additional diagnostic categories should be con-
sidered if the individual’s symptoms are predominantly catatonic: catatonia associated
with another mental disorder, catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, and
unspecified catatonia.

Schizoaffective Disorder

_Schizoaffective_ is a term first used by Jacob Kasanin (1933) to describe a small group of
severely ill patients with a mix of psychotic and mood symptoms. In DSM-5, the hall-


**76** DSM-5 Guidebook

mark of schizoaffective disorder is the presence of either a major depressive or a manic
mood episode concurrent with psychotic symptoms that meet schizophrenia Crite-
rion A, such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized
or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms. Additionally, mood symptoms must be
a _prominent_ feature of the condition and not a minor aspect. Other causes of these
symptoms, including other medical conditions, substances of abuse, and medica-
tions, must be ruled out. The symptoms typically present together, or sometimes in
an alternating fashion; psychotic symptoms may be mood-congruent or mood-incon-
gruent.
Although schizoaffective disorder has long filled an important role in psychiatric
practice, the diagnosis has suffered from low reliability. This situation began in 1980
when the diagnosis was included in DSM-III but had no operational criteria. Instead,
two clinical vignettes were described in which the diagnosis was used. Criteria were
introduced in DSM-III-R, and these continued mostly unchanged through DSM-IV.
The criteria indicated that the mood symptoms had to be present for a “substantial
portion of the total duration” of the illness; however, little guidance was given to help
clinicians judge how long the duration of the mood symptoms should be relative to
the duration of the illness. This gap has now been addressed: a major mood episode
must be present for the majority of the total duration of the active and residual por-
tions of the illness (i.e., the time since Criterion A has been met). This change should
help clarify the boundaries of the disorder by providing guidance to the clinician
about the proportion of time the patient experiences a mood syndrome.

Diagnostic Criteria for Schizoaffective Disorder

A. An uninterrupted period of illness during which there is a major mood episode (ma-
jor depressive or manic) concurrent with Criterion A of schizophrenia.
**Note:** The major depressive episode must include Criterion A1: Depressed mood.
B. Delusions or hallucinations for 2 or more weeks in the absence of a major mood
episode (depressive or manic) during the lifetime duration of the illness.
C. Symptoms that meet criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority
of the total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of
abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

Specify whether:
**295.70 (F25.0) Bipolar type:** This subtype applies if a manic episode is part of
the presentation. Major depressive episodes may also occur.
**295.70 (F25.1) Depressive type:** This subtype applies if only major depressive
episodes are part of the presentation.

Specify if:
**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental
disorder, DSM-5, pp. 119–120, for definition).
**Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with
schizoaffective disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia.


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **77**

Specify if:
The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year duration of the dis-
order and if they are not in contradiction to the diagnostic course criteria.
**First episode, currently in acute episode:** First manifestation of the disorder
meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is
a time period in which the symptom criteria are fulfilled.
**First episode, currently in partial remission:** Partial remission is a time period
during which an improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in
which the defining criteria of the disorder are only partially fulfilled.
**First episode, currently in full remission:** Full remission is a period of time af-
ter a previous episode during which no disorder-specific symptoms are present.
**Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode:** Multiple episodes may be de-
termined after a minimum of two episodes (i.e., after a first episode, a remission
and a minimum of one relapse).
**Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission
Multiple episodes, currently in full remission
Continuous:** Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder
are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with subthreshold symptom
periods being very brief relative to the overall course.
**Unspecified**

Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psy-
chomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be
rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Di-
mensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,”
this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder can be made without using this se-
verity specifier.

Criterion A

The presence of psychotic and mood symptoms is the essence of schizoaffective dis-
order. There must be an uninterrupted period in which major depressive or manic
symptoms must be concurrent with Criterion A (of schizophrenia) psychotic symp-
toms. In fact, for many if not most individuals, the actual duration of the symptom
overlap is a matter of months or years, not days or weeks.

Criterion B

An important change in DSM-5 is that psychotic symptoms have to be present for 2
or more weeks in the absence of a major mood episode (depressive or manic) “during
the lifetime duration of the illness” rather than “during the same period of illness” as
in DSM-IV. This change was prompted by the goal of making explicit that the diagnosis


**78** DSM-5 Guidebook

of schizoaffective disorder is based on the assessment of psychotic and mood symp-
toms during the lifetime duration of the illness. DSM-IV implied that a “period of ill-
ness” could refer, at a minimum, to a single _episode_ of illness lasting at least 1 month
(to meet Criterion A) or, at a maximum, to the _lifetime duration_ of the illness. To in-
crease reliability, the authors of DSM-IV restricted the diagnosis to a given episode.
This resulted in a person’s receiving a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, schizo-
phreniform disorder, schizophrenia, or even a psychotic mood disorder at various
times during the illness.

Criterion C

The DSM-IV phrase “substantial portion of the total duration of the active and resid-
ual periods of the illness” has been replaced with “majority of the total duration of
the active and residual portions, of the illness.” The change was necessary because of
the low reliability of the criterion and its limited clinical utility. Furthermore, the rel-
ative proportion of mood and psychotic symptoms can change over time, and clini-
cians and researchers often used different thresholds when applying this criterion.
Researchers in several large studies had set the figure at 30% for total duration of their
mood episodes (relative to the total duration of psychosis), but after examining field
trial data the Psychotic Disorders Work Group recommended a threshold set at 50%
as indicated by the word _majority._ Also new to DSM-5, Criterion C requires the assess-
ment of mood symptoms not only during a current period of illness but over the entire
course of a psychotic illness. If the mood symptoms are present for only a relatively
brief period of time, the diagnosis is schizophrenia rather than schizoaffective disor-
der. When deciding whether an individual meets Criterion C, the clinician should re-
view the total duration of psychotic illness (i.e., both active and residual symptoms)
and determine when significant mood symptoms (untreated or in need of treatment
with antidepressant and/or mood-stabilizing medication) accompanied the psy-
chotic symptoms. This requires historical information and clinical judgment. For exam-
ple, an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual symptoms of schizo-
phrenia develops depressive and manic episodes that, taken together, do not occupy
more than 1 year during the 4-year history of psychotic illness. This presentation
would not meet Criterion C. The diagnosis in this example is schizophrenia, with the
additional diagnosis of major depressive disorder to indicate the superimposed de-
pressive episode.

Criterion D

Medical illnesses, medications, and drugs of abuse need to be ruled out as a cause of
the disturbance.

Subtypes and Specifiers

The clinician may indicate whether the presentation includes a manic episode (bipo-
lar type) or whether only major depressive episodes occur (depressive type). The
presence of catatonia may be specified, as may course and current severity.


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **79**

Substance/Medication-Induced

Psychotic Disorder

The essential feature of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is that the
delusions or hallucinations (Criterion A) are judged to be causally related to the ef-
fects of a substance or medication because they have developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal, or following exposure to a medication (Crite-
rion B). Last, the disturbance is not better explained by an independent psychotic dis-
order (Criterion C). The criteria have been edited for clarity and readability but are
otherwise unchanged from DSM-IV. The diagnosis is used when the symptoms are in
_excess_ of those associated with an intoxication or withdrawal syndrome. For example,
because hallucinations can occur during an alcohol withdrawal delirium, an addi-
tional diagnosis of a substance-induced psychotic disorder is not appropriate.
The diagnosis is common among persons who abuse substances, as well as in hos-
pitals and clinics, where medications are often the cause of induced psychotic symp-
toms. The initiation of the disorder varies considerably depending on the substance
and its pharmacological properties. For example, smoking a high dose of cocaine may
produce psychosis within minutes, but days or weeks of high doses of alcohol or
sedatives may be required to produce psychosis. Hallucinations may occur in any
modality, but in the absence of a delirium they are often auditory. Alcohol-induced
psychotic disorder usually occurs only after heavy prolonged use (generally years) in
individuals with an alcohol use disorder. Stimulant medications are known to pro-
duce persecutory delusions, which may develop rapidly following the use of the
stimulant (e.g., amphetamine, methamphetamine). Induced psychotic disorders usu-
ally resolve when the offending agent is withdrawn, although in some cases they can
persist for weeks or months even when the person is treated with antipsychotic med-
ications.
The diagnostic code recorded depends on the class of the substance. Further spec-
ifications include whether the symptoms had an onset during intoxication or with-
drawal, and current severity.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Psychotic Disorder

A. Presence of one or both of the following symptoms:

1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
    Criterion A.


**80** DSM-5 Guidebook

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a psychotic disorder that is not sub-
stance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent psychotic disorder
could include the following:
The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the ces-
sation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence of
an independent non-substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (e.g., a
history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/med-
ication]-induced psychotic disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use dis-
order present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is co-
morbid with the substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is
“1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the sub-
stance-induced psychotic disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-in-
duced psychotic disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and
the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance]
use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only
the substance-induced psychotic disorder.

Specify if (see Table 16–1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders”
for diagnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for intoxication with the
substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
**With onset during withdrawal:** If the criteria are met for withdrawal from the
substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.

Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, abnormal psychomotor behavior,
and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not
present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psycho-
sis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,” this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder can be
made without using this severity specifier.

Criterion A

In DSM-IV, if a person realized that his or her hallucinations were substance or medica-
tion induced, the hallucinations were not counted toward this diagnosis, but this no
longer applies.

Criterion B

The delusions and/or hallucinations must have developed “during or soon after” sub-
stance intoxication or withdrawal or after other exposure to a medication, and the sub-
stance/medication involved must be “capable” of producing the psychosis. This
language is more specific than in DSM-IV, which used the phrase “etiologically related.”

Criteria C, D, and E

This criterion outlines situations that cast doubt on a putative relationship between
the use of a substance and the psychosis. For example, if the symptoms were present
before the onset of substance or medication use, it is likely the psychosis is not sub-
stance induced. Delirium has been excluded as a cause of the psychosis, in which case
the delirium would be separately coded. The disturbance must cause clinically signif-
icant distress or impairment.

Psychotic Disorder Due to Another

Medical Condition

This diagnosis is relatively unchanged from DSM-IV except for the addition of Crite-
rion E to acknowledge the presence of significant distress or impairment. In addition,
there must be evidence that the disorder is the direct pathophysiological consequence
of another medical condition, and the disorder must not occur exclusively in the course
of a delirium (otherwise the diagnosis is delirium). The code used is based on whether
delusions or hallucinations are the predominant symptom. Further, the name of the
medical disorder is included in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., psychotic disor-
der due to malignant lung neoplasm). Current severity can also be recorded.

Diagnostic Criteria for Psychotic Disorder Due to a
Another Medical Condition

A. Prominent hallucinations or delusions.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings
that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another
medical condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Specify whether:
Code based on predominant symptom:
**293.81 (F06.2) With delusions:** If delusions are the predominant symptom.
**293.82 (F06.0) With hallucinations:** If hallucinations are the predominant symptom.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the
mental disorder (e.g., 293.81 [F06.2] psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neo-
plasm, with delusions). The other medical condition should be coded and listed sep-
arately immediately before the psychotic disorder due to the medical condition (e.g.,
162.9 [C34.90] malignant lung neoplasm; 293.81 [F06.2] psychotic disorder due to
malignant lung neoplasm, with delusions).
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, abnormal psychomotor behavior,
and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not
present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psycho-
sis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,” this volume.)

Catatonia Associated With Another

Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)

Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier) may be used
when criteria are met for catatonia during the course of a neurodevelopmental, psy-
chotic, bipolar, depressive, or other mental disorder. The catatonia specifier is appro-
priate when the clinical picture is characterized by marked psychomotor disturbance
and involves at least 3 of the 12 diagnostic features listed in Criterion A.
While catatonia occurs in over one-third of schizophrenia cases, the majority of
catatonia cases occur in patients with a mood disorder. For this reason, catatonia was
added as an episode specifier for the major mood disorders in DSM-IV. Catatonic symp-
toms need to be recognized because they have prognostic and treatment implications.
The presence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome should be ruled out because of the
serious nature of its complications.
The name of the associated mental disorder should be included when recording
the name of the disorder (e.g., catatonia associated with schizoaffective disorder).

Diagnostic Criteria for Catatonia Associated With
Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier) **293.89 (F06.1)**

A. The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more) of the following symptoms: 

1. Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to environment).
2. Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity).
    3. Waxvy flexibility (i.e., slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner).
4. Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [exclude if known aphasia]).
5. Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli).
6. Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against
    gravity).
7. Mannerism (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions).
8. Stereotypy (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed move-
    ments).
9. Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli.
10. Grimacing.
11. Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another’s speech).
12. Echopraxia (i.e., mimicking another’s movements).

**Coding note:** Indicate the name of the associated mental disorder when recording
the name of the condition (i.e., 293.89 [F06.1] catatonia associated with major depres-
sive disorder). Code first the associated mental disorder (e.g., neurodevelopmental
disorder, brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaf-
fective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or other mental disorder)
(e.g., 295.70 [F25.1] schizoaffective disorder, depressive type; 293.89 [F06.1] catato-
nia associated with schizoaffective disorder).


**84** DSM-5 Guidebook

Catatonic Disorder Due to

Another Medical Condition

Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition has been moved from the DSM-
IV chapter “Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition.” Catatonia has
generally been viewed as a subtype of schizophrenia, as reflected in DSM-IV, but re-
search has shown that catatonic symptoms can result from several medical disorders.
For that reason, catatonic disorder due to a general medical condition was added as
a new category in DSM-IV. The criteria for this disorder have changed to reflect
greater specificity in the symptoms and impairment caused by the condition.

Diagnostic Criteria for Catatonic Disorder
Due to Another Medical Condition **293.89 (F06.1)**

A. The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more) of the following symptoms: 

1. Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to environment).
2. Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity).
3. Waxy flexibility (i.e., slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner).
4. Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [ **Note:** not applicable if there
    is an established aphasia]).
5. Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli).
6. Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against
    gravity).
7. Mannerism (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions).
8. Stereotypy (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed move-
    ments).
9. Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli.
10. Grimacing.
11. Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another’s speech).
12. Echopraxia (i.e., mimicking another’s movements).
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical
condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., a manic ep-
isode).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the medical condition in the name of the mental
disorder (e.g., 293.89 [F06.1]) catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy). The
other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the
catatonic disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 572.2 [K71.90] hepatic enceph-
alopathy; 293.89 [F06.1] catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy).


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **85**

Criterion A

This criterion requires the presence of 3 or more of 12 symptoms typical for catatonia.
In DSM-IV, the criteria were unclear as to how many symptoms were required.

Criteria B and C

Because catatonic symptoms have been associated with a variety of medical disor-
ders, medical conditions apart from the disorder in question need to be ruled out as
a cause. This entails a detailed medical workup to rule out neurological, infectious,
and other potential causes of the symptoms. For example, before concluding that the
catatonia resulted from a herpes-related encephalopathy, the clinician should rule out
brain tumors and other mass lesions.
Catatonic symptoms can occur in the context of other major mental disorders,
such as mania, and these disorders need to be ruled out as well.

Criteria D and E

If the symptoms occur only in the context of a delirium, then delirium is the appro-
priate diagnosis. This criterion is new to DSM-5 and specifies that the symptoms
cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, and other important
areas of functioning.

Unspecified Catatonia

Catatonic syndromes can occur within the context of many other disorders, including
psychotic disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, and general medical condi-
tions. In DSM-5, catatonia is no longer listed as a specific subtype of schizophrenia,
but the text recognizes catatonic disorder as being due to another medical condition,
as a specifier for a psychotic disorder or a depressive or bipolar disorder, or as an un-
specified catatonia.

Unspecified Catatonia

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of catatonia
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning but either the nature of the underlying mental disorder
or other medical condition is unclear, full criteria for catatonia are not met, or there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room
settings).
**Coding note:** Code first **781.99 (R29.818)** other symptoms involving nervous and muscu-
loskeletal systems, followed by **293.89 (F06.1)** unspecified catatonia.

The diagnosis unspecified catatonia may be used when individuals with catatonic
symptoms have clinically significant distress or impairment but the nature of the un-

derlying mental disorder or other medical condition is unclear, the full criteria for
catatonic disorder are not met, or there is insufficient information to make a more spe-
cific diagnosis.

Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and

Other Psychotic Disorder and Unspecified

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic

Disorder

Other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disor-
ders are residual categories for individuals whose symptoms do not fit within one of
the more specific categories. The categories replace DSM-IV’s psychotic disorder not
otherwise specified.
Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder can be used
in situations in which an individual has symptoms characteristic of a spectrum disor-
der that cause distress or impairment but that do not meet full criteria for a more spe-
cific disorder. In this case, the clinician chooses to communicate the reason that
individual’s symptoms do not meet the criteria. Specific examples are given in DSM-
5 to describe situations in which this diagnosis may be appropriate. The category un-
specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder is used when the cli-
nician chooses not to specify the reason that criteria are not met for a more specific
disorder, or when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorder **298.8 (F28)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a schizo-
phrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predom-
inate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spec-
trum and other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The other specified schizophre-
nia spectrum and other psychotic disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not
meet the criteria for any specific schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
This is done by recording “other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “persistent auditory hallucinations”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Persistent auditory hallucinations** occurring in the absence of any other features.
2. **Delusions with significant overlapping mood episodes:** This includes persis-
    tent delusions with periods of overlapping mood episodes that are present for a
    substantial portion of the delusional disturbance (such that the criterion stipulating
    only brief mood disturbance in delusional disorder is not met).


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **87**

3. **Attenuated psychosis syndrome:** This syndrome is characterized by psychotic-
    like symptoms that are below a threshold for full psychosis (e.g., the symptoms are
    less severe and more transient, and insight is relatively maintained).
4. **Delusional symptoms in partner of individual with delusional disorder:** In the
    context of a relationship, the delusional material from the dominant partner pro-
    vides content for delusional belief by the individual who may not otherwise entirely
    meet criteria for delusional disorder.

Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorder **298.9 (F29)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a schizo-
phrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predom-
inate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spec-
trum and other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder category is used in situations in which the cli-
nician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emer-
gency room settings).

Clinician-Rated Dimensions of

Psychosis Symptom Severity

The Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity is available to help
the clinician make detailed assessments of individuals across important domains,
including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor
behavior, negative symptoms, impaired cognition, depression, and mania. This in-
strument is described in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures.”

KEY POINTS

- Chapter organization has changed so that schizophrenia spectrum and other
    psychotic disorders are arranged along a gradient from least to most severe.
    Severity is defined by the level, number, and duration of psychotic signs and
    symptoms.
- Schizotypal personality disorder has been included in the schizophrenia spec-
    trum, but the criteria and text remain in the personality disorders chapter. Evi-
    dence has accumulated since its initial description in DSM-III confirming its
    close etiological relationship with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.


**88** DSM-5 Guidebook

- In the criteria for delusional disorder, the adjective nonbizarre has been re-
    moved (Criterion A), and the somatic subtype has been edited to ensure that
    individuals with a delusion regarding a physical defect are more appropriately
    diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder.
- The diagnosis shared psychotic disorder has been eliminated because it was
    infrequently used and persons with the diagnosis generally had symptoms that
    met criteria for some other psychotic disorder (e.g., delusional disorder).
- With schizophrenia, bizarre delusions and “first-rank” hallucinations are no longer
    accorded special treatment. Further, clinicians will no longer record schizophre-
    nia subtypes; despite historical precedent, there is scant research evidence sup-
    porting their clinical utility or predictive validity.
- The criteria for schizoaffective disorder now clarify that mood symptoms must
    constitute the “majority of the total duration of the active and residual portions
    of the illness.” The change was necessary because of the low reliability and lim-
    ited clinical utility of the wording in DSM-IV.

## The major change in DSM-5 regarding mood disorders is that the

DSM-IV chapter of that name has been divided into two separate chapters: one for bi-
polar and related disorders and the other for depressive disorders. Both diagnostic
classes are reviewed in this chapter.
Mood disorders are highly prevalent, have high morbidity, and are associated
with early mortality and suicide. They are among the world’s most disabling ill-
nesses, as documented in _The Global Burden of Disease_ (Murray and Lopez 1996). Char-
acterized by prominent and prolonged disturbances of mood generally inappropriate
to the individual’s life situation, depression and mania are considered the primary
syndromes. Many symptoms occur in individuals with mood disorder, including in-
somnia, suicidal thoughts, anorexia, and feelings of being a burden to others in indi-


**90** DSM-5 Guidebook

viduals with depression, and euphoria, irritability, decreased need for sleep, and
hyperactivity in individuals with mania. In DSM-III, these conditions were collec-
tively referred to as _affective disorders,_ but they were renamed mood disorders for
DSM-III-R. The term _mood disorder_ is more appropriate because _affect_ refers to fluctu-
ating mood changes in emotional expression, whereas _mood_ refers to more sustained
and pervasive feeling states.
The mood disorders have been divided in many different ways over the years in
attempts to identify the best classification scheme. Although that goal has been elu-
sive, research and clinical experience both show that the fundamental symptoms of
mood disorders are depressed mood, elevated mood, or an admixture of the two.
Despite having a limited number of disorders, the two DSM-5 mood disorder chap-
ters are lengthy because of all the specifiers that can be used to provide greater detail
about an individual’s illness. These allow the clinician to record whether the current or
most recent episode is manic, hypomanic, or depressed; whether the mood disorder is
accompanied by anxious distress; whether there are mixed features, melancholic fea-
tures, atypical features, psychotic features, or catatonia; whether there is rapid cycling;
whether there is a peripartum onset; or whether there is a seasonal pattern.
Because mood symptoms are not specific to these diagnostic classes and are found
in many other psychiatric disorders, differential diagnosis is complicated. For exam-
ple, manic/hypomanic symptoms commonly occur in individuals with neurocogni-
tive disorders or in those with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders,
whereas depression is found to some extent in individuals with disorders as wide
ranging as adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Mood
symptoms are sometimes masked as complaints about insomnia, fatigue, or unex-
plained pain, which can further complicate the differential diagnosis.
Historically, mood disorders are among the oldest recognized psychiatric syn-
dromes, and have been included in nearly all diagnostic classification systems through
the centuries. Both depressive and bipolar conditions were included within the same
category in DSM-I (“manic depressive reaction”) and DSM-II (“manic-depressive ill-
ness”). All were classified as psychoses except one: mood syndromes precipitated by
stressful life experience. Later, unipolar and bipolar disorders were separated in re-
sponse to research showing that individuals with manic episodes have a fundamentally
different course and outcome than those who experience only depression. These new
concepts were reflected in the Feighner criteria (Feighner et al. 1972), the Research Di-
agnostic Criteria (Spitzer et al. 1975), and DSM-III. This fundamental distinction has
been fully accepted by psychiatric clinicians and researchers.
We begin with a review of the DSM-5 chapter on bipolar and related disorders,
which include those disorders listed in Table 5–1.

BIPOLAR AND RELATED DISORDERS

This diagnostic class recognizes disorders characterized by marked oscillations in mood,
activity, and behavior. The classic form of bipolar disorder was described by Kraepelin
as an illness that was episodic and nondeteriorating, in contrast to schizophrenia. Re-
search evidence has confirmed the existence of a milder form of the disorder, which was

listed in DSM-III as an atypical bipolar disorder and given its own category, bipolar II
disorder, in DSM-IV. In DSM-5, bipolar and related disorders are placed between the
chapters on schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders and the depressive
disorders in recognition of their place in bridging these diagnostic classes.
Several changes were made in the criteria for DSM-5, with the goal of improving
specificity and sensitivity of the bipolar diagnoses. One objective was to reduce the
delay from the onset of first symptoms to correct diagnosis. Because of misdiagnosis,
people with bipolar disorder often receive inappropriate treatments, such as antide-
pressant pharmacotherapy in the absence of mood stabilizers, and thus are exposed
to the risk of cycle acceleration or hypomanic/manic switches, mixed states, and sui-
cidal behaviors. Improving diagnostic precision is expected to increase recognition of
bipolarity among people presenting with depressed mood and increase the probabil-
ity of their receiving early treatment.
The Mood Disorders Work Group added the phrase “persistently increased goal-
directed activity or energy” to Criterion A for both mania and hypomania. This addi-
tion should make explicit the requirement that this hallmark symptom of bipolar I or
II disorder needs to be present for the diagnosis to be made. The work group also rec-
ommended deleting the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, mixed type, which required
the criteria for mania and major depressive episode to be met simultaneously. In-
stead, a “with mixed features” specifier has been added that can be applied to mania
or hypomania when depressive features are present. The requirement that both full
syndromes be present was difficult to employ and had the potential to lead clinicians
to ignore important mood symptoms that failed to meet full diagnostic threshold
(Cassano et al. 2004; Goldberg et al. 2009).
Another change is that mania or hypomania that emerges during antidepressant
treatment (a medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at full syndromal
level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is now considered sufficient
evidence for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
In summary, these changes reflect refinements aimed at improving the recognition
and treatment of bipolar disorders by encouraging the clinician to observe and record
symptoms reflecting increased activity and mixed forms of mania/hypomania and
depression to consider in treatment decisions and future patient follow-up. Addition-
ally, people with substance-induced conditions that persist beyond the action of a
medication or substance will now receive a bipolar diagnosis.

Manic Episode

Diagnostic Criteria for Manic Episode

For a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the following criteria for a
manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed
by hypomanic or major depressive episodes.

A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable
mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least
1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospital-
ization is necessary).
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or
more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a
significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:

1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant exter-
    nal stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)
    or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-
    quences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or
    foolish business investments).
C. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social
or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self
or others, or there are psychotic features.
D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.
**Note:** A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,
medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level be-
yond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic ep-
isode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.
**Note:** Criteria A–D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is
required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

Criterion A

The phrase “persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy” has been added
to ensure that changes in both mood and activity level are appropriately recognized.
Increased activity or energy is a core symptom of mania and hypomania. This change
is prompted by the concern that mild mania, hypomania, and subthreshold bipolar
features are often unrecognized or misdiagnosed as major depressive disorder when


**_Mood Disorders_** **93**

level of activity is not taken into account (Angst et al. 2011, 2012). Furthermore, be-
cause the clinician is often seeing the individual in the depressive state and attempt-
ing to assess mania retrospectively, it may be easier for the individual to recall periods
of increased activity than changes in mood that may be more subtle and ego-syntonic.
The addition of “persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy” will increase
specificity of the application of this diagnosis.
The wording has also been changed to acknowledge that these symptoms are
present “most of the day, nearly every day.” This helps clinicians distinguish mania
(and hypomania) from borderline personality disorder and the mood swings that
people with this condition typically report (i.e., very short-lived, usually involving a
change from feeling normal to suddenly feeling angry or depressed, and tending to
occur in response to a psychosocial stressor).

Criterion B

The wording “increased energy or activity” has been added to this criterion to empha-
size the importance of this symptom in distinguishing mania and hypomania. In addi-
tion, the wording “and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior” was added
to emphasize that mania and hypomania represent a change from the person’s usual
behavior, and constitute a distinct mood or mood state. Clearly, manic changes repre-
sent an alteration in conduct and behavior that is not normal for the individual, and that
is usually observable to others, especially family members distressed by the changes
noted in their loved one. Three or more of seven classic manic symptoms are required
for the diagnosis (four if the mood is only irritable).

Criterion C

This criterion is simplified from DSM-IV Criterion D. Mania is clearly impairing. Al-
though mild forms may be tolerated (and perhaps even desirable in some situations),
full-blown mania can be disastrous to the individual’s personal and professional life,
particularly when the individual makes bad decisions about his or her personal life
(e.g., infidelity, sexual promiscuity) or business (e.g., major purchases, personnel de-
cisions). Delusions and/or hallucinations (e.g., believing one is wealthy, has a special
religious mission, knows famous persons) may further influence a person’s behavior.

Criterion D

This criterion requires that the mania not be induced by a substance (e.g., drug of
abuse, medication, other treatment). There are many drugs that have been associated
with manic symptoms and need to be ruled out (e.g., stimulants, corticosteroids). The
notation that mania resulting from antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, elec-
troconvulsive therapy) and persisting “at a fully syndromal level beyond the physio-
logical effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and,
therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis” is new to DSM-5. By contrast, in DSM-IV, “manic-like
episodes” that were “clearly caused by somatic antidepressant treatment” were not
to be counted toward a bipolar I diagnosis.


**94** DSM-5 Guidebook

Specifiers

In DSM-5, the “with mixed features” specifier for mania, hypomania, and depressive
episodes has replaced the criteria in DSM-IV for bipolar I disorder, most recent episode
mixed. The criteria were often considered confusing, and therefore persons with de-
pressive symptoms may have been ignored and their symptoms unrecognized. Be-
cause a substantial proportion of individuals with bipolar disorder (and persons
whose symptoms meet criteria for a major depressive episode) also describe an admix-
ture of depressive (or manic) symptoms that are insufficient in number to meet the
DSM-IV definition of a mixed episode, the significance of the symptoms went unno-
ticed or the symptoms were altogether ignored. The presence of mixed symptoms is
important to recognize because it has been associated with course (earlier onset),
greater number of episodes, higher likelihoods of alcohol abuse and suicide attempts,
greater likelihood of rapid cycling, and greater likelihood of a lifetime diagnosis of bi-
polar disorder.

Hypomanic Episode

The criteria for hypomanic episode describe a mild form of mania that may be seen
either in the course of bipolar I disorder or as a regular part of bipolar II disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Hypomanic Episode

A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable
mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least
4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or
more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted,
represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a
significant degree:

1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant exter-
    nal stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)
    or psychomotor agitation.
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-
    quences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or
    foolish business investments).
C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is un-
characteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.
D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.


**_Mood Disorders_** **95**

E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occu-
pational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic fea-
tures, the episode is, by definition, manic.
F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment).
**Note:** A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,
medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond
the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic epi-
sode diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (partic-
ularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are
not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indica-
tive of a bipolar diathesis.
**Note:** Criteria A–F constitute a hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes are com-
mon in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

The criteria for hypomanic episode are mostly unchanged from DSM-IV other
than the added phrase “persistently increased activity or energy” in Criterion A, and
the added requirement that the changes be present “most of the day, nearly every
day,” also in Criterion A. Also new is the notation indicating that a hypomanic epi-
sode can result from antidepressant therapy, but that if only one or two symptoms are
present, the diagnosis is not justified.

Major Depressive Episode

See “Depressive Disorders” later in this chapter for criteria for and discussion of ma-
jor depressive episode.

Bipolar I Disorder

DSM-5 no longer includes six separate criteria sets for bipolar I disorder as in DSM-
IV. Emphasis is now given to the use of specifiers, as previously noted.

Diagnostic Criteria for Bipolar I Disorder

A. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode (Criteria A–D under “Manic
Episode” above).
B. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better ex-
plained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, de-
lusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorder.

**Coding and Recording Procedures**
The diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current or most recent
episode and its status with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features,
and remission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full


**96** DSM-5 Guidebook

criteria are currently met for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifi-
ers are only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a manic, hypomanic,
or major depressive episode. Codes are as follows:

In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: bi-
polar I disorder, type of current or most recent episode, severity/psychotic/remission
specifiers, followed by as many specifiers without codes as apply to the current or
most recent episode.

Bipolar II Disorder

Criteria for bipolar II disorder are relatively unchanged from DSM-IV except for mi-
nor editing. Emphasis is placed on the use of specifiers, as noted earlier in the chapter.

Diagnostic Criteria for Bipolar II Disorder **296.89 (F31.81)**

For a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, it is necessary to meet the criteria for a current or
past hypomanic episode and the following criteria for a current or past major depressive
episode.

A. Criteria have been met for at least one hypomanic episode (Criteria A–F under “Hy-
pomanic Episode”; see p. 94) and at least one major depressive episode (Criteria
A–C under “Major Depressive Episode”; see pp. 108–109).
B. There has never been a manic episode.
C. The occurrence of the hypomanic episode(s) and major depressive episode(s) is
not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform
disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spec-
trum and other psychotic disorder.
D. The symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent alternation
between periods of depression and hypomania causes clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding and Recording Procedures**
Bipolar II disorder has one diagnostic code: 296.89 (F31.81). Its status with respect to
current severity, presence of psychotic features, course, and other specifiers cannot
be coded but should be indicated in writing (e.g., 296.89 [F31.81] bipolar II disorder,
current episode depressed, moderate severity, with mixed features; 296.89 [F31.81]
bipolar II disorder, most recent episode depressed, in partial remission).

Specify current or most recent episode:
**Hypomanic
Depressed**

Specify if:
**With anxious distress** (DSM-5, p. 149)
**With mixed features** (DSM-5, pp. 149–150)
**With rapid cycling** (DSM-5, pp. 150–151)
**With mood-congruent psychotic features** (DSM-5, p. 152)
**With mood-incongruent psychotic features** (DSM-5, p. 152)
**With catatonia** (DSM-5, p. 152). **Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89
(F06.1).
**With peripartum onset** (DSM-5, pp. 152–153)
**With seasonal pattern** (DSM-5, pp. 153–154): Applies only to the pattern of major
depressive episodes.

Specify course if full criteria for a mood episode are not currently met:
**In partial remission** (DSM-5, p. 154)
**In full remission** (DSM-5, p. 154)


**98** DSM-5 Guidebook

Specify severity if full criteria for a mood episode are currently met:
**Mild** (DSM-5, p. 154)
**Moderate** (DSM-5, p. 154)
**Severe** (DSM-5, p. 154)

Cyclothymic Disorder

The individual with cyclothymic disorder has mild swings between the two poles of
depression and hypomania. In the hypomanic phase, the person appears to be high
but not so high as to be socially or professionally incapacitated. In the depressed
phase, the individual has symptoms of depression, but not severe enough to meet cri-
teria for a full major depressive episode. Thus, the individual with cyclothymic dis-
order tends to swing from high to low and may have chronic mild mood instability.
The disorder was first included in DSM-III and was derived from DSM-II (Amer-
ican Psychiatric Association 1968) cyclothymic personality, described as a “behavior
pattern [that is] manifested by recurring and alternating periods of depression and
elation” (p. 42). The move to the mood disorders chapter (“Affective Disorders” in
DSM-III) was made based on evidence that cyclothymic disorder was related to bipo-
lar disorder; for example, some individuals will develop manic episodes, whereas
others will develop major depressive episodes, and therefore meet criteria for either
a bipolar I or II disorder.
The DSM-5 criteria for cyclothymia are mostly unchanged from DSM-IV, but have
been edited for clarity. The major change has been to indicate that during the 2-year
period hypomanic and depressive symptoms have been present for “at least half the
time.” This is in addition to the existing requirement (in DSM-IV) that individuals
could not be without symptoms for “more than 2 months at a time.” The new word-
ing provides greater guidance to clinicians, and reinforces the concept of cyclothymia
being a relatively chronic and persistent mood disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Cyclothymic Disorder **301.13 (F34.0)**

A. For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been nu-
merous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic
episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for
a major depressive episode.
B. During the above 2-year period (1 year in children and adolescents), the hypoman-
ic and depressive periods have been present for at least half the time and the in-
dividual has not been without the symptoms for more than 2 months at a time.
C. Criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have never been met.
D. The symptoms in Criterion A are not better explained by schizoaffective disorder,
schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or
unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).

F. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.

Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and

Related Disorder

The criteria for substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder derive from those for
DSM-IV substance-induced mood disorder but are specific to bipolar disorder. These
criteria are patterned after those for manic episode except that the bipolar disorder is
induced by a substance of abuse or a medication.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Bipolar and Related Disorder

A. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture
and is characterized by elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, with or without depressed
mood, or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both
(1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxica-
    tion or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
    Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a bipolar or related disorder that is not
substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent bipolar or relat-
ed disorder could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the ces-
sation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-in-
duced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/
medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medica-
tion]-induced bipolar and related disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with
the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and
the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced


**100** DSM-5 Guidebook

bipolar and related disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar
and related disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with
the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and
the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance]
use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there
is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the sub-
stance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub-
stance-induced bipolar and related disorder.

Specify if (see Table 16–1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders”
for diagnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
**With onset during withdrawal:** If criteria are met for withdrawal from the sub-

Clinicians should note the potential for confusing this disorder with a bipolar I or
II disorder that emerges during antidepressant treatment. In substance/medication-
induced bipolar and related disorder, the symptoms are clearly associated with the
ingestion of a substance and do _not_ persist beyond the physiological effect of that
treatment. The opposite occurs in bipolar I or II disorder, in that a manic/hypomanic
episode emerging _during_ antidepressant treatment (medication, electroconvulsive
therapy) and persisting at the full syndromal level for a _substantial period of time_ after
the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication is evidence of bipolarity.

Bipolar and Related Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

The criteria for bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition are pat-
terned after the DSM-IV criteria for mood disorder due to a general medical condition


**_Mood Disorders_** **101**

but are specific to bipolar disorder. In this case, the manic or hypomanic episode has
been attributed to a medical condition.

Diagnostic Criteria for Bipolar and Related Disorder
Due to Another Medical Condition

A. A prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable
mood and abnormally increased activity or energy that predominates in the clinical
picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the dis-
turbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning, or necessitates hospitalization
to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for bipolar and related disorder due to another
medical condition is **293.83,** which is assigned regardless of the specifier. The ICD-
10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below).

Specify if:
**(F06.33) With manic features:** Full criteria are not met for a manic or hypomanic
episode.
**(F06.33) With manic- or hypomanic-like episode:** Full criteria are met except
Criterion D for a manic episode or except Criterion F for a hypomanic episode.
**(F06.34) With mixed features:** Symptoms of depression are also present but do
not predominate in the clinical picture.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the
mental disorder (e.g., 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with
manic features). The other medical condition should also be coded and listed sepa-
rately immediately before the bipolar and related disorder due to the medical condition
(e.g., 242.90 [E05.90] hyperthyroidism; 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder due to hyper-
thyroidism, with manic features).

Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder

and Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder

The diagnoses other specified bipolar and related disorder and unspecified bipolar
and related disorder are residual categories that replace DSM-IV’s bipolar disorder
not otherwise specified.
The category other specified bipolar and related disorder is used for individuals
with symptoms characteristic of a bipolar or related disorder that cause distress or
impairment but do not meet the full criteria for a more specific disorder. In this case,
the clinician chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet


**102** DSM-5 Guidebook

full criteria. Clinicians are encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., short-dura-
tion hypomanic episodes [2-3 days] and major depressive episodes).
The category unspecified bipolar and related disorder is used when characteristic
symptoms are present that cause distress or impairment but these symptoms do not
meet full criteria for a more specific disorder, and the clinician chooses not to commu-
nicate the reason criteria for a more specific disorder are not met, or there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Bipolar and
Related Disorder **296.89 (F31.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar
and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class.
The other specified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does
not meet the criteria for any specific bipolar and related disorder. This is done by re-
cording “other specified bipolar and related disorder” followed by the specific reason
(e.g., “short-duration cyclothymia”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2–3 days) and major depressive episodes:**
    A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals whose pre-
    sentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have
    experienced two or more episodes of short-duration hypomania that meet the full
    symptomatic criteria for a hypomanic episode but that only last for 2–3 days. The ep-
    isodes of hypomanic symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive epi-
    sodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with
    mixed features.
2. **Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major depressive epi-**
    **sodes:** A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals
    whose presentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but
    who have experienced one or more episodes of hypomania that do not meet full
    symptomatic criteria (i.e., at least 4 consecutive days of elevated mood and one or
    two of the other symptoms of a hypomanic episode, or irritable mood and two or
    three of the other symptoms of a hypomanic episode). The episodes of hypomanic
    symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive episodes, so the distur-
    bance does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with mixed features.
3. **Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive episode:** One or more hy-
    pomanic episodes in an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria
    for a major depressive episode or a manic episode. If this occurs in an individual
    with an established diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), both
    diagnoses can be concurrently applied during the periods when the full criteria for
    a hypomanic episode are met.


**_Mood Disorders_** **103**

4. **Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 24 months):** Multiple episodes of hypo-
    manic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and multiple ep-
    isodes of depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive
    episode that persist over a period of less than 24 months (less than 12 months for
    children or adolescents) in an individual whose presentation has never met full cri-
    teria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and does not meet crite-
    ria for any psychotic disorder. During the course of the disorder, the hypomanic or
    depressive symptoms are present for more days than not, the individual has not been
    without symptoms for more than 2 months at a time, and the symptoms cause clini-
    cally significant distress or impairment.

Unspecified Bipolar and
Related Disorder **296.80 (F31.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar and
related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full cri-
teria for any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clini-
cian chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific bipolar
and related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information
to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS

The DSM-5 depressive disorders are listed in Table 5–2. There are two new diagnoses:
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A new
specifier to indicate the presence of mixed symptoms has been added across the depres-
sive disorders. The core criterion items applied to the diagnosis major depressive dis-
order, as well as its 2-week duration, are unchanged from DSM-IV, although minor
editing changes have been made. The Mood Disorders Work Group concluded that the
major depressive disorder criteria, which were introduced in DSM-III and which had
accumulated considerable research support, have held up well over the past 30 years.
One important change is the omission of the so-called bereavement exclusion.
This change led to unwanted controversy whereby critics claimed it would medical-
ize the normal process of bereavement. In DSM-IV, major depressive episode Crite-
rion E required that the symptoms be “not better accounted for by Bereavement.”
This exclusion applied to symptoms lasting less than 2 months following the death of
a loved one. The change for DSM-5 was made because evidence does not support the
separation of loss of a loved one from other stressors in terms of its likelihood of pre-
cipitating a major depressive episode or in terms of the relative likelihood that the
symptoms will remit spontaneously. Bereavement is a severe psychosocial stressor
known to precipitate major depressive episodes in vulnerable persons. Typically, when


**104** DSM-5 Guidebook

that happens, the depression begins soon after the loss. Although bereavement may
be painful, most persons do not develop a major depressive episode. Those who do,
however, typically experience more suffering, feel worthless, and may have suicidal
ideation. General medical health can suffer, as can interpersonal and work function.
These individuals can be at risk for “complicated grief,” characterized by ruminating
about the deceased person, seeking proximity to the deceased person, and striving to
avoid experiences that trigger reminders of loss. Furthermore, bereavement-related
depression has most of the characteristics of a major depressive episode; that is, it is
most likely to occur in individuals with past personal and family history of a major
depressive episode, is genetically influenced, and is associated with similar personal-
ity characteristics, patterns of comorbidity, and outcome. Finally, the symptoms asso-
ciated with a bereavement-related major depressive disorder respond to antidepres-
sant medication. Depending on the particular circumstances, the clinician observing
a full depressive syndrome in an individual within the first 2 months following the
death of a loved one can elect to observe rather than initiate treatment.
The coexistence within a major depressive episode of at least three manic/hypo-
manic symptoms insufficient to satisfy criteria for a manic/hypomanic episode is now
acknowledged with the specifier “with mixed features.” This change recognizes find-
ings from family and follow-up studies that show that the presence of mixed features
in an episode of major depressive disorder increases the likelihood that the illness falls
within the bipolar spectrum. The presence of a full manic syndrome within a depres-
sive episode will continue to be an exclusion criterion for a depressive disorder diag-
nosis, and individuals with this pattern will be considered to have a bipolar disorder.
The addition of _disruptive mood dysregulation disorder_ and _premenstrual dysphoric
disorder_ has generated controversy, although of a different order of magnitude than
that pertaining to the bereavement exclusion. Disruptive mood dysregulation disor-
der was created in part to address concerns about the possible overdiagnosis of bipo-
lar disorder in children younger than 12 years who display persistent irritability and
frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol (Axelson et al. 2006). On the other
hand, premenstrual dysphoric disorder was moved from Appendix B of DSM-IV (“Cri-
teria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study”) to become a stand-alone diagnosis
following a careful literature review.

**_Mood Disorders_** **105**

There has been some controversy about the premenstrual dysphoric disorder di-
agnosis through the years. Some groups have felt that a disorder that focuses on the
menstrual cycle may “pathologize” normal reproductive functioning. Others have
believed that the disorder serves to stigmatize women’s health, and perhaps implies
that women would not be able to perform needed activities during the premenstrual
phase of the cycle. Because the disorder is common and problematic, work group
members concluded that it would be inappropriate _not_ to acknowledge the condition
or encourage clinicians to recognize the disorder and offer appropriate treatment.
Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is new to DSM-5 and merges DSM-IV-
defined chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major depressive
disorder may precede persistent depressive disorder, and major depressive episodes
may occur during persistent depressive disorder. There is no longer a requirement
that the disturbance not occur exclusively during the course of a chronic psychotic dis-
order, such as schizophrenia or delusional disorder (DSM-IV Criterion F). This change
allows clinicians to diagnose persistent depressive disorder in persons with one of
these psychotic conditions.
In summary, the depressive disorders chapter reflects refinements aimed at im-
proving the recognition and treatment of these conditions by encouraging the clini-
cian to record and consider specifiers that allow coverage of important information
not conveyed by the categorical diagnoses themselves. New diagnoses have been
added that address problems that are common and have been inadequately covered
in DSM, yet are associated with significant distress and impairment, and merit recog-
nition and special clinical management.

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder

The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will help fill an important
gap for children with mood dysregulation characterized by chronic, severe persistent
irritability. In the past 20 years, there has been a 40-fold increase in the number of
youth diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Research, however, shows that children with
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have a different outcome, gender ratio, and
family history than those with bipolar disorder. Furthermore, they do not go on to de-
velop manic or hypomanic episodes. While impaired, these children often have
symptoms that meet criteria for other disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disor-
ders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The Childhood and Adolescent
Disorders Work Group concluded that the best fit was with the depressive disorders.
Initially, the work group considered naming the disorder “temper dysregulation
disorder” but in response to feedback chose to name it “disruptive mood dysregula-
tion disorder.” Because most of the children who meet criteria for this new disorder
will also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder (due to overlapping symp-
toms), the work group decided that youth who meet criteria for both disorders should
be assigned only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. This
avoids the problem of having artificial comorbidity due to overlapping criteria.


**106** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Disruptive Mood
Dysregulation Disorder **296.99 (F34.8)**

A. Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g., verbal rages) and/or
behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly
out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation.
B. The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level.
C. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week.
D. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the
day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
E. Criteria A–D have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the
individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all of
the symptoms in Criteria A–D.
F. Criteria A and D are present in at least two of three settings (i.e., at home, at
school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these.
G. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18
years.
H. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria A–E is before 10 years.
I. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the
full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been
met.
**Note:** Developmentally appropriate mood elevation, such as occurs in the context
of a highly positive event or its anticipation, should not be considered as a symp-
tom of mania or hypomania.
J. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive dis-
order and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent de-
pressive disorder [dysthymia]).
**Note:** This diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent
explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder, though it can coexist with others, including
major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disor-
der, and substance use disorders. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for
both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder
should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an
individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned.
K. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to
another medical or neurological condition.

Criteria A and B

This item notes that the child has “severe recurrent _temper outbursts_ ...that are grossly
out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation” (emphasis
added). Because nearly all children have temper tantrums, this criterion is needed to
help distinguish ordinary tantrums from outbursts that stand apart due to their se-


**_Mood Disorders_** **107**

verity and regularity. Furthermore, the outbursts are inconsistent with the situation,
and most parents would see these as indicating the child is out of control. Also, the
outbursts are manifested verbally and/or behaviorally, such as in a tantrum, and are
not consistent with the child’s developmental level (i.e., the child is outside the range
of the “terrible twos”).

Criteria C, D, and E

The requirement that temper outbursts occur three or more times per week is some-
what arbitrary, but the point is that the outbursts occur regularly and with some fre-
quency. Between outbursts the child’s mood is persistently irritable or angry “most of
the day, nearly every day.” In other words, the symptoms are not just a passing phase.
These symptoms have been present for 12 or more months, during which time the
child has not had at least 3 consecutive months without all of the symptoms in Crite-
ria A–D. This item also indicates that the symptoms do not represent a temporary
phase, but are pervasive and lasting.

Criterion F

The symptoms occur in at least two settings, such as at home and school. Some chil-
dren seem to turn symptoms on and off at will, and this criterion separates those chil-
dren in whom the symptoms seem voluntary from those who seem less likely to be
able to control themselves.

Criteria G and H

This diagnosis is not made before the child is age 6 years nor after the youth turns age
18 years (Criterion G). This criterion helps to establish that the temper outbursts are
not attributable to a neurodevelopmental syndrome, in which the symptoms would
likely have an earlier onset, and are not attributable to adult misbehavior from an an-
tisocial personality disorder, which is not diagnosed in persons under age 18 years.
Onset is before age 10 years (Criterion H). Again, this criterion helps guard against
using the diagnosis to justify a bipolar diagnosis, which generally has an onset during
adolescence or beyond.

Criteria I, J, and K

Criterion I helps separate disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar dis-
order by excluding individuals with symptoms that meet the full criteria for a manic
or hypomanic episode for more than 1 day. Also, the item recognizes, in a note, that
some “developmentally appropriate” episodes of mood elevation can occur in the
context of a highly positive event or its anticipation (e.g., a birthday party, a visit to
an amusement park) and should not be confused with bipolar disorder.
Criteria J and K ensure that the temper outbursts do not occur exclusively during
a major depressive episode and are not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., autism spectrum disorder), and that the symptoms are not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance or to another medical or neurological condition.


**108** DSM-5 Guidebook

It is further noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot coexist with
oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder. On
the other hand, it may coexist with some other mental disorders, such as major de-
pressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and sub-
stance use disorders.
If the child’s symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation dis-
order and oppositional defiant disorder, the former diagnosis trumps the latter. Re-
search shows that most children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will
also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, but the
reverse is not true. Only about 15% of children with oppositional defiant disorder will
have symptoms that also meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Major Depressive Episode

The syndrome major depressive episode described in DSM-III continues in DSM-5
nearly unchanged apart from editing changes, except for the bereavement exclusion
and several new specifiers to help clinicians better describe an individual’s episode
(see “Depressive Disorders” introduction above). Major depressive disorder is the
codable disorder for people with one or more major depressive episodes. Major de-
pressive disorders are coded based on whether only a single major depressive episode
has occurred or the episodes are recurrent.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major Depressive Episode

A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-
week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the
symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.
**Note:** Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical con-
dition.

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either sub-
    jective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others
    (e.g., appears tearful). ( **Note:** In children and adolescents, can be irritable
    mood.)
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of
    the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or obser-
    vation).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more
    than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly
    every day. ( **Note:** In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others,
    not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be


**_Mood Disorders_** **109**

```
delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being
sick).
```
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day
    (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation
    without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing sui-
    cide.
B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to an-
other medical condition.
**Note:** Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode.
**Note:** Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from
a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of
intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss
noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symp-
toms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a
major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss
should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of
clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the ex-
pression of distress in the context of loss.^1
D. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional dis-
order, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-
chotic disorders.
E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.
**Note:** This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like epi-
sodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of an-
other medical condition.

(^1) In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in
grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent
depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief
is likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs
of grief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The
depressed mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupa-
tions. The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are unchar-
acteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of MDE. The thought content
associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the
deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in MDE. In grief, self-
esteem is generally preserved, whereas in MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are
common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings
vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much
he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts
are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in
MDE such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless, unde-
serving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.

**Coding and Recording Procedures**
The diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether this is a single
or recurrent episode, current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission
status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are cur-
rently met for a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if
the full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes are as fol-
lows:

In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: ma-
jor depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission
specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to
the current episode.

Specify:
**With anxious distress** (DSM-5, p. 184)
**With mixed features** (DSM-5, pp. 184–185)

Criterion A

This item specifies that five or more of nine depressive symptoms must be present for
a diagnosis of major depressive episode to be given, and at least one must be criterion
A1 (depressed mood) or A2 (loss of interest or pleasure). This list has remained un-
changed since DSM-III-R and contains the classic depressive symptoms recognized for


**_Mood Disorders_** **111**

centuries. Although individual symptoms are common in the general population, the
fact that they cluster together over a minimum of 2 weeks to form the syndrome sets
the diagnosis apart. It is important for clinicians to note that each item must be present
during the 2-week period before it is counted as “present.” Some symptoms that may
have been present before the onset of the episode count only if they become apprecia-
bly worse during the episode. For example, some individuals have chronic insomnia
that would otherwise not count unless it worsens as part of the depressive illness.
The most important symptoms are depressed mood (Criterion A1) and loss of in-
terest or pleasure (criterion A2), and one of the two is required. Some depressed indi-
viduals will have lost the ability to describe their emotions (alexithymia) or to feel
that they are depressed; others have trouble acknowledging depressed mood for cul-
tural or other reasons. In almost all cases, the person will be able to admit to loss of
interest or pleasure. Criterion A8 can be vexing because many disorders can cause
poor concentration. Many individuals with mild or early forms of dementia will re-
port memory impairment and difficulty concentrating. That said, the most important
cause of these symptoms is depression and not dementia.
Suicidal thoughts or behaviors (criterion A9) are the most worrisome of the de-
pressive symptoms, and once these are ascertained, the clinician will need to explore
this symptom at greater length to determine the individual’s degree of suicidality and
the urgency of medical intervention.
Clinicians should note that there must be an interval of at least 2 months in which
criteria are _not_ met for two major depressive episodes to be considered separate and
independent episodes.

Criterion B

Originally Criterion C in DSM-IV, this criterion states that depressive symptoms must
cause “clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning.” This criterion, added to the diagnosis in DSM-IV, is
supplemented by the specifiers of mild, moderate, and severe. Although depression
is perceived by most as distressing, the social and occupational impairment may
manifest in a variety of ways. The individual may have poor job performance due to
impaired concentration or being overly tired and therefore being inefficient at work.
He or she may take too many sick days or not show up. In the social arena, the person
may ignore friendships and become withdrawn; irritability may drive off remaining
friends. Families may suffer because the person ignores household tasks due to lack
of motivation. In severe cases, individuals may become preoccupied with thoughts of
death or dying, or develop suicidal plans; some will attempt (or complete) suicide.

Criterion C

Alternative explanations for the syndrome must be eliminated during the process of
differential diagnosis. Substances of abuse, medications, and other medical condi-
tions need to be ruled out. Alcohol and other drugs are known to induce depression;
in such cases, the appropriate diagnosis is substance/medication-induced depressive
disorder. Likewise, medical conditions such as hypothyroidism are associated with


**112** DSM-5 Guidebook

depression and need to be ruled out as the cause; in these cases, the more appropriate
diagnosis is depressive disorder due to another medical condition. These conditions
will have important treatment implications.

Criterion D

The depression is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder and is not superim-
posed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other
specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. All of
these disorders may be accompanied to some extent by the presence of depression.

Criterion E

The individual has never had a manic or a hypomanic episode. This criterion is im-
portant because it helps to separate major depressive disorder from bipolar disorder.
This distinction is fundamental to the mood disorders and has important treatment im-
plications. That said, for individuals with subsyndromal manic or hypomanic symp-
toms, the specifier “with mixed features” is available.

Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode

Specifiers

The specifiers allow the clinician to describe the individual’s illness in great detail, in-
cluding recording whether the mood disorder is accompanied by anxious distress;
whether there are mixed features, melancholic features, atypical features, psychotic
features, or catatonia; and whether the depression had a peripartum onset or has a
seasonal pattern. Clinicians can rate the major depressive episode as mild, moderate,
or severe and as with or without psychotic features.
The DSM-IV specifier “with postpartum onset” has been changed to “with peri-
partum onset.” This change acknowledges that half of major depressive episodes oc-
cur _prior_ to delivery. The specifier is appropriate for when a major depressive episode
develops during pregnancy or during the 4 weeks following delivery.

Major Depressive Disorder,

Recurrent Episode

For a major depressive disorder to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval
of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not
met for a major depressive episode.

Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)

Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is a chronic and persistent disturbance in
mood present for at least 2 years (or at least 1 year for children and adolescents) and


**_Mood Disorders_** **113**

characterized by relatively typical depressive symptoms, such as anorexia, insomnia,
decreased energy, low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of hopeless-
ness. The diagnosis merges DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and
dysthymic disorder. Clinicians had trouble distinguishing the two disorders, and
consolidating the disorders will make it easier to identify individuals with chronic
and persistent depression.
Dysthymic disorder was introduced in DSM-III and was referred to parentheti-
cally as depressive neurosis. Individuals with a persistent depressive disorder often
develop relatively more severe major depressive episodes. When the major depres-
sive episode clears, these individuals subsequently return to their chronic state of
dysthymia. The coexistence of both mild and severe forms of depression is sometimes
referred to as “double depression” because both disorders are coded.
The criteria for persistent depressive disorder are mostly unchanged from those
for DSM-IV dysthymic disorder. The most important difference affects Criterion D.
DSM-IV specified the _absence_ of any major depressive episode in the first 2 years of
the disturbance. The Mood Disorders Work Group was concerned that clinicians were
unable to reliably distinguish dysthymic disorder from chronic major depressive dis-
order. Many clinicians were confused about the differences and tended to ignore one
or the other diagnosis. Part of the confusion stems from the fact that patients are
asked to recall information that most individuals are unable to retrieve. That is, does
the patient recall having had in that 2-year period (that could have been decades in
the past) any symptom-free periods longer than 2 months in duration, or having had
2 weeks or more in which he or she had symptoms that met criteria for a major de-
pressive episode (in which case the patient would receive the diagnosis major depres-
sive disorder). These changes should help clinicians distinguish these disorders more
reliably. Research also showed that there were few differences among individuals
with dysthymic disorder and those with chronic major depressive disorder in symp-
toms, family history, or treatment response (Klein et al. 2004; McCullough et al. 2000).

Diagnostic Criteria for Persistent Depressive
Disorder (Dysthymia) **300.4 (F34.1)**

This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive
disorder and dysthymic disorder.

A. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as indicated by either
subjective account or observation by others, for at least 2 years.
**Note:** In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at
least 1 year.

B. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following:

1. Poor appetite or overeating.
2. Insomnia or hypersomnia.
3. Low energy or fatigue.
4. Low self-esteem.


**114** DSM-5 Guidebook

5. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions.
6. Feelings of hopelessness.

C. During the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents) of the disturbance, the
individual has never been without the symptoms in Criteria A and B for more than 2
months at a time.
D. Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously present for 2 years.
E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode, and criteria have
never been met for cyclothymic disorder.
F. The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent schizoaffective disorder,
schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).
H. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include four symptoms that
are absent from the symptom list for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), a very
limited number of individuals will have depressive symptoms that have persisted longer
than 2 years but will not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. If full criteria
for a major depressive episode have been met at some point during the current epi-
sode of illness, they should be given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Other-
wise, a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive
disorder is warranted.

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

The Mood Disorders Work Group recommended that premenstrual dysphoric disor-
der receive full disorder status in DSM-5. In DSM-IV, it was included in Appendix B
and, if present, was coded as depressive disorder not otherwise specified. Since the
disorder was initially proposed in DSM-III-R as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder,
research evidence has accumulated and shown the disorder to be prevalent and to
cause significant distress and impairment. The work group felt that information on
the diagnosis, treatment, and validators of the disorder had matured to the point that
the disorder qualified for inclusion as an independent diagnosis.
Clinical research and epidemiological studies have shown that many women ex-
perience symptoms that begin during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and ter-
minate around the onset of menses. Additionally, these studies identified a subset of
women (about 2% in the community) who suffer intermittently from severe symptoms
associated with the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Women with these symptoms
have not been adequately covered in DSM. Including premenstrual dysphoric disor-
der helps ensure that clinicians will recognize the syndrome and that women with the
disorder will receive appropriate treatment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Premenstrual
Dysphoric Disorder **625.4 (N94.3)**

A. In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the
final week before the onset of menses, start to improve within a few days after the
onset of menses, and become minimal or absent in the week postmenses.
B. One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:

1. Marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings; feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or
    increased sensitivity to rejection).
2. Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts.
3. Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating
    thoughts.
4. Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge.
C. One (or more) of the following symptoms must additionally be present, to reach a
total of five symptoms when combined with symptoms from Criterion B above.
1. Decreased interest in usual activities (e.g., work, school, friends, hobbies).
2. Subjective difficulty in concentration.


**116** DSM-5 Guidebook

3. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy.
4. Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings.
5. Hypersomnia or insomnia.
6. A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control.
7. Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain,
    a sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain.
**Note:** The symptoms in Criteria A–C must have been met for most menstrual cycles
that occurred in the preceding year.
D. The symptoms are associated with clinically significant distress or interference with
work, school, usual social activities, or relationships with others (e.g., avoidance of
social activities; decreased productivity and efficiency at work, school, or home).
E. The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disor-
der, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, persistent depressive dis-
order (dysthymia), or a personality disorder (although it may co-occur with any of
these disorders).
F. Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least two
symptomatic cycles. ( **Note:** The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this
confirmation.)
G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition (e.g.,
hyperthyroidism).

Substance/Medication-Induced

Depressive Disorder

Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is diagnosed when an individ-
ual’s depressive symptoms have clearly resulted from the effect of a substance or
from its withdrawal. Such disorders occur commonly and have been associated with
particular substances, with alcohol being perhaps the most common incitant. The dis-
order is also frequently observed in hospital and clinic populations. The diagnostic
criteria are mostly unchanged from those for substance-induced mood disorder in
DSM-IV except that Criterion A has been edited to reflect the focus on depressive
symptoms, as is appropriate for this chapter. Coding depends on the substance impli-
cated as inducing the disorder. The name of the substance is included in the name of
the disorder (e.g., alcohol-induced depressive disorder).

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Depressive Disorder

A. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical
picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest
or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):


**_Mood Disorders_** **117**

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
    Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not sub-
stance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent depressive disor-
der could include the following:
The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms
persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of
acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the
existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced depressive disor-
der (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/med-
ication]-induced depressive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use dis-
order present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comor-
bid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,”
and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-
induced depressive disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced
depressive disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and
the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance]
use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the
substance-induced depressive disorder.

stance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.

Depressive Disorder Due to

Another Medical Condition

Some people develop depressive symptoms that are attributable to a known medical
disorder. These disorders are common, particularly in hospitals and consultation-
liaison services. Many physical disorders, such as hypothyroidism, are known to in-
duce depressive disorders. The DSM-5 criteria alert clinicians to the possibility that a
person’s depression is induced and that a search for a medical cause may be appro-
priate. For that reason, this diagnosis has important treatment implications.
The diagnosis may be further specified as with depressive features, with major de-
pressive–like episode, or with mixed features. In recording the diagnosis, the name of
the other medical condition should be included in the name of the disorder (e.g., de-
pressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with mixed features).

est or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical
condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., adjustment
disorder, with depressed mood, in which the stressor is a serious medical condition).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.


**_Mood Disorders_** **119**

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for depressive disorder due to another medical
condition is **293.83,** which is assigned regardless of the specifier. The ICD-10-CM

**(F06.31) With depressive features:** Full criteria are not met for a major depressive
episode.
**(F06.32) With major depressive–like episode:** Full criteria are met (except Crite-
rion C) for a major depressive episode.
**(F06.34) With mixed features** : Symptoms of mania or hypomania are also present
but do not predominate in the clinical picture.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental
disorder (e.g., 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depres-
sive features). The other medical condition should also be coded and listed separately im-
mediately before the depressive disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 244.9 [E03.9]
hypothyroidism; 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depres-
sive features).

Other Specified Depressive Disorder and

Unspecified Depressive Disorder

These categories replace DSM-IV’s depressive disorder not otherwise specified. The
category other specified depressive disorder is used when symptoms characteristic of
a depressive disorder are present and cause distress or impairment but do not meet the
full criteria for a more specific disorder in the class, and when the clinician chooses to
communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet full criteria. The clinician
is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., recurrent brief depression, short-dura-
tion depressive episode [4–13 days], depressive episode with insufficient symptoms).
The category unspecified depressive disorder is used when the the full criteria for
a more specific disorder are not met but symptoms cause clinically significant distress
or impairment, and the clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not
met, or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Depressive Disorder **311 (F32.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
any of the disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The other specified de-
pressive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any
specific depressive disorder. This is done by recording “other specified depressive dis-
order” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “short-duration depressive episode”).


**120** DSM-5 Guidebook

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Recurrent brief depression:** Concurrent presence of depressed mood and at
    least four other symptoms of depression for 2–13 days at least once per month
    (not associated with the menstrual cycle) for at least 12 consecutive months in an
    individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or
    bipolar disorder and does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psy-
    chotic disorder.
2. **Short-duration depressive episode (4–13 days):** Depressed affect and at least
    four of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with
    clinically significant distress or impairment that persists for more than 4 days, but less
    than 14 days, in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any
    other depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual cri-
    teria for any psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for recurrent brief de-
    pression.
3. **Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms:** Depressed affect and at least
    one of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with
    clinically significant distress or impairment that persist for at least 2 weeks in an
    individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or
    bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psy-
    chotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for mixed anxiety and depressive dis-
    order symptoms.

Unspecified Depressive Disorder **311 (F32.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depres-
sive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The un-
specified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific depressive
disorder, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make
a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- The mood disorders have been split into two chapters: “Bipolar and Related
    Disorders” and “Depressive Disorders.”
- The wording “persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy” has been
    added to Criterion A for manic episode and hypomanic episode. This should
    make explicit the requirement that this hallmark symptom of bipolar I or II dis-
    order needs to be present for the diagnosis to be made.


**_Mood Disorders_** **121**

- The diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, most recent episode mixed, which required
    criteria for both mania and major depressive episode to be met simultaneously,
    has been deleted. Instead, a “with mixed features” specifier has been added that
    can be applied to a manic episode or a hypomanic episode when depressive
    features are present.
- With the depressive disorders, an important change is the omission of the be-
    reavement exclusion that applied in DSM-IV to depressive symptoms lasting less
    than 2 months following the death of a loved one. This change was made because
    evidence does not support the separation of loss of a loved one from other stress-
    ors in terms of its likelihood of precipitating a major depressive episode.
- Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is new to the depressive disorders and
    describes the presentation of children with persistent irritability and behavioral
    dyscontrol. This change should help reduce the problem of overdiagnosis of bi-
    polar disorder in children and adolescents.
- Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is new and merges DSM-IV-defined
    chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Clinicians had trou-
    ble distinguishing the two disorders.
- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder has been elevated to a stand-alone diagnosis.
    The diagnosis applies to the presentation of women who develop a cluster of
    depressive symptoms in association with their menstrual cycle.

## Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric con-

ditions worldwide. Research consistently shows them to be associated with increased
psychiatric and physical morbidity, use of health care services, and psychosocial im-
pairment. Necessity dictates that clinicians recognize and treat anxiety disorders
without delay. Table 6–1 lists the DSM-5 anxiety disorders.
The word _anxiety_ has been used to describe diverse phenomena, but in the clinical
literature the term refers to the presence of fear or apprehension that is out of propor-
tion to the situation. Anxiety was considered to play an important role in several con-
ditions identified in the nineteenth century (Goodwin and Guze 1989). In the late
nineteenth century, Da Costa wrote about an “irritable heart syndrome,” character-
ized by chest pain, palpitations, and dizziness, a disorder thought to be due to a func-
tional cardiac disturbance. He described the syndrome as occurring in a Civil War
veteran, and later the syndrome was variously referred to as “soldier ’s heart,” the “effort
syndrome,” or “neurocirculatory asthenia.” At about the same time, Beard described
_neurasthenia,_ thought to be a disorder of nervous exhaustion. Freud later separated
neurasthenia from cases affected mainly with anxiety symptoms under the name _anx-_

_iety neurosis._ He described its clinical characteristics as including general irritability,
anxious expectation, pangs of conscience, anxiety attacks, and phobias.
In DSM-I, the category psychoneurotic disorders constituted a distinct class in
which anxiety was the chief characteristic. According to DSM-I, the anxiety “may be
directly felt and expressed or... may be unconsciously and automatically controlled
by the utilization of various psychological defense mechanisms” (p. 31). Several “reac-
tions” were enumerated, including “anxiety reaction” and “phobic reaction”—disorders
that continue to be recognized as anxiety disorders—and others that now fall into sepa-
rate categories (i.e., dissociative reaction, obsessive compulsive reaction). In DSM-II,
the category was renamed “neuroses” and the term _reaction_ was eliminated, but the
category was otherwise mostly unchanged.
DSM-III’s all-encompassing changes led to a regrouping of some disorders and
the creation of new disorders in which anxiety was either experienced as the predom-
inant disturbance or experienced by the person as he or she attempted to master its
symptoms (e.g., confronting a dreaded object or situation). The new diagnostic class,
anxiety disorders, included panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, simple pho-
bia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic
stress disorder (which was hyphenated until DSM-IV). Acute stress disorder was later
added in DSM-IV. DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and DSM-IV-TR otherwise remained true to DSM-
III, except for minor changes in the criteria sets and some name changes (e.g., from
simple phobia to specific phobia).
In DSM-5, the anxiety disorders chapter has remained largely faithful to its immedi-
ate predecessor, with several major exceptions. Obsessive-compulsive disorder now has
its own chapter (see Chapter 7, “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders”). Post-
traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder have been moved to “Trauma- and
Stressor-Related Disorders” (see Chapter 8). These changes were made in response to sci-
entific data showing that these disorders stand apart from the other anxiety disorders.
The sequential order of the chapters in DSM-5 (i.e., the metastructure), however, reflects
the close relationship among the disorders. Last, separation anxiety disorder and selec-


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **125**

tive mutism are new to the chapter, having been formerly included in the DSM-IV chap-
ter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.”
Other changes include the wording of criteria sets, which have been modified to
1) reflect the dysfunction underlying these disorders as intense, frequent, and chronic
fear and anxiety; 2) separate the main constructs (e.g., situational triggers, cognitive ide-
ation, intensity, frequency, duration); and 3) enhance consistency across the disorders.
For specific phobia and social anxiety disorder, changes include deletion of the require-
ment that adults recognize that their anxiety is excessive or unreasonable. In addition,
the minimum 6-month duration, which had been limited to individuals under age 18
years in DSM-IV, has been extended to all ages. The essential features of panic attacks
remain unchanged, but the terminology for describing different types has been re-
placed with the terms _expected_ or _unexpected._ Panic disorder and agoraphobia have been
unlinked, and the criteria for agoraphobia have been extended to be consistent with cri-
teria sets for the other disorders. With social anxiety disorder, the “generalized” speci-
fier had been deleted and replaced with a “performance only” specifier.

Separation Anxiety Disorder

Separation anxiety disorder is a condition in which a person has excessive anxiety re-
garding separation from places or people to whom he or she has a strong emotional
attachment. Included with the childhood disorders in DSM-III through DSM-IV-TR,
separation anxiety disorder has now been moved because of research that links it to
the anxiety disorders and the growing recognition that it occurs in adults. In fact, the
lifetime estimate of separation anxiety disorder in childhood is 4.1%, whereas the rate
among adults is 6.6%. Although about one-third of adults with separation anxiety
disorder had it in childhood, the majority of adults had a first onset in adulthood. In
children, the strong emotional attachment is likely to a parent; with adults, the attach-
ment might be to a spouse or a friend.
Separation anxiety disorder should not be confused with separation anxiety that
occurs as a normal stage of development for healthy, secure babies. Separation anxi-
ety typically starts at around 8 months of age and increases until 13–15 months, when
it begins to decline.

Diagnostic Criteria for Separation Anxiety Disorder **309.21 (F93.0)**

A. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation
from those to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by at least three of the
following:

1. Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing separation
    from home or from major attachment figures.
2. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures or about
    possible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or death.
3. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event (e.g.,
    getting lost, being kidnapped, having an accident, becoming ill) that causes
    separation from a major attachment figure.


**126** DSM-5 Guidebook

4. Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to school, to work,
    or elsewhere because of fear of separation.
5. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without ma-
    jor attachment figures at home or in other settings.
6. Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to sleep with-
    out being near a major attachment figure.
7. Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.
8. Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches,
    nausea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is
    anticipated.

B. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and
adolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults.
C. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, aca-
demic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refus-
ing to leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum
disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders;
refusal to go outside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill
health or other harm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or
concerns about having an illness in illness anxiety disorder.

Criterion A

Although some separation anxiety is normal at various developmental phases, when
the fear or anxiety is excessive and functionally impairing, this diagnosis may be ap-
propriate. To increase the relevance to adults with separation anxiety disorder, terms
have been added (e.g., addition of “work” in Criterion A4) or deleted (e.g., removal
of “adults” in DSM-IV’s Criterion A5 because attachment figures are not always
adults; for adults, attachment figures can be partners, children, and so forth).

Criterion B

The duration is specified as typically lasting at least 6 months in adults (instead of the
4-week requirement in DSM-IV that has been retained in DSM-5 for children and ad-
olescents) to minimize overdiagnosis of transient fears. A caveat permits shorter du-
rations in cases of acute onset or exacerbation of severe symptoms.

Criteria C and D

Separation anxiety disorder is associated with significant impairment. People with
the disorder may refuse to attend school or work, complain of somatic problems, and
become socially isolated. Untreated, the disorder is associated with low educational
attainment, unemployment, and either remaining unmarried or experiencing marital
disruption. Because separation anxiety may occur in association with other mental
disorders, the clinician needs to determine whether the person’s symptoms meet full
criteria for an independent diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder.


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **127**

Selective Mutism

Selective mutism is characterized by the consistent failure to speak in specific social
situations where speaking is expected despite being able to speak in other situations
(e.g., at home). Originally named “elective mutism” in DSM-III, and renamed “selec-
tive mutism” for DSM-IV, the disorder was included with DSM-IV’s “Disorders Usu-
ally First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.” Selective mutism has been
moved because of research that connects it with the anxiety disorders, and growing
recognition that it continues into adulthood (or in rare cases begins in adulthood). Se-
lective mutism is rare and most likely to manifest in young children.

Diagnostic Criteria for Selective Mutism **313.23 (F94.0)**

A. Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which there is an expec-
tation for speaking (e.g., at school) despite speaking in other situations.
B. The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with
social communication.
C. The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of
school).
D. The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with,
the spoken language required in the social situation.
E. The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder (e.g., child-
hood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively during the course of
autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder.

Criterion A

When encountering individuals in specific social interactions, children and adults
with selective mutism do not initiate speech or reciprocally respond when spoken to
by others. These same individuals when seen at home, however, can interact nor-
mally. The diagnosis requires a _consistent_ failure to speak in social situations.

Criterion B

Selective mutism is associated with significant impairment. Children with selective
mutism often refuse to speak at school, leading to academic or educational impair-
ment. As these children mature, they may face increasing social isolation, and in
school settings, they suffer academic impairment because often they do not commu-
nicate appropriately with teachers regarding academic or personal needs.

Criterion C

Selective silence lasting less than a month (e.g., a child’s being upset and refusing to
talk for a few days) would not meet criteria for the diagnosis.


**128** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion D

Children in families who have immigrated to a country where a different language is
spoken may refuse to speak the new language because of lack of knowledge of the
language. If comprehension of the new language is adequate but refusal to speak per-
sists, a diagnosis of selective mutism would be warranted.

Criterion E

Although children with selective mutism generally have normal language skills, there
may occasionally be an associated communication disorder. Selective mutism should be
distinguished from speech disturbances that are better explained by a communication
disorder, such as language disorder, speech sound disorder (previously phonological
disorder), childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), or pragmatic (social) communi-
cation disorder. Unlike selective mutism, the speech disturbance in these conditions is
not restricted to a specific social situation. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder,
schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, or severe intellectual disability may have
problems with social communication and be unable to speak appropriately in social sit-
uations. In contrast, selective mutism should be diagnosed only when a child has an es-
tablished capacity to speak in some social situations (typically at home).

Specific Phobia

The term _phobia_ refers to an excessive fear of a specific object, circumstance, or situa-
tion. Phobias are classified on the basis of the feared object or situation. Both specific
phobia and social anxiety disorder (social phobia) require the development of intense
anxiety, upon exposure to the feared object or situation. Both diagnoses also require
that the fear or anxiety either interferes with functioning or causes marked distress.
Specific phobia includes the following specifiers: animal, natural environment,
blood-injection-injury, situational, and other (for phobias that do not clearly fall into
the previous four categories). The key feature for each stimulus type is that the fear
or anxiety is limited to a specific object, both temporally and with respect to other ob-
jects. An individual with specific phobia becomes immediately frightened or anxious
when presented with a feared object. This fear may relate to concern about harm from
a feared object, concern about embarrassment, or fear of consequences related to expo-
sure to the feared object. For example, individuals with blood-injection-injury phobia
may be afraid of fainting on exposure to blood, and individuals with fear of heights may
be afraid of becoming dizzy.
Specific phobia may involve fear of more than one object, particularly within a
specific subcategory of phobia. For example, an individual with a phobia of insects
may also have a phobia of mice, both phobias being classified as animal-type phobias.
Quantifying the impairment associated with a specific phobia is sometimes difficult,
because a comorbid disorder typically tends to cause more impairment than a specific
phobia. Impairment associated with specific phobia typically restricts the social or
professional activities of the individual.
Phobias have been recognized as incapacitating for more than 100 years. The
prominent place of phobias in the history of modern mental health is indicated by the


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **129**

major role that case histories of patients with phobias played in the development of
both psychoanalytic and cognitive therapies. The phobia category has undergone
progressive refinement over the years. In DSM-III, phobias were regarded as a group
of related but distinct conditions. Between DSM-III and DSM-IV, specific phobia was
modified to include subcategories, based on research noting distinct physiology and
demographics of the stimulus types.
Specific phobias are usually quite easily distinguished from other conditions be-
cause of the focused nature of the anxiety, both over time and with respect to objects
or situations. The most difficult diagnostic issues involve differentiating specific pho-
bia from other anxiety disorders.
Specific phobia exhibits a bimodal age at onset, with a childhood peak for animal
phobia, natural environment phobia, and blood-injection-injury phobia and an early
adulthood peak for other phobias, such as situational phobia. Because individuals
with isolated specific phobias rarely present for treatment, research on the course of
the disorder in the clinic is limited. Data suggest that most specific phobias that begin
in childhood and persist into adulthood will continue to persist over many years. The
severity of the condition when it persists into adulthood is thought to remain rela-
tively constant, without the waxing and waning course of the disorder during child-
hood and adolescence or seen with other anxiety disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Specific Phobia

A. Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, an-
imals, receiving an injection, seeing blood).
**Note:** In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freez-
ing, or clinging.

B. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety.
C. The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or
anxiety.
D. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific
object or situation and to the sociocultural context.
E. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.
F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
G. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disor-
der, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like
symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia); objects or situa-
tions related to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of
traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or at-
tachment figures (as in separation anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in so-
cial anxiety disorder).

300.29 (F40.248) Situational (e.g., airplanes, elevators, enclosed places).
300.29 (F40.298) Other (e.g., situations that may lead to choking or vomiting; in chil-
dren, e.g., loud sounds or costumed characters).
```
**Coding note:** When more than one phobic stimulus is present, code all ICD-10-CM
codes that apply (e.g., for fear of snakes and flying, F40.218 specific phobia, animal,
and F40.248 specific phobia, situational).

Criteria A and B

There is marked fear or anxiety that is triggered by exposure to a specific stimulus.
The term _marked_ has been operationalized as “intense.” The phrase “fear or anxiety”
is used consistently across anxiety disorders. The phobic object or situation almost al-
ways provokes immediate fear or anxiety.

Criterion C

There are generally two responses to the fear or anxiety elicited by the stimulus. A per-
son may avoid situations in which he or she is exposed to the stimulus, or the person
may expose himself or herself to the phobic object or situation and endure the fear or
anxiety. DSM-5 has added the descriptor “actively avoided” to minimize overdiagno-
sis of mild fears.

Criterion D

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion, or more intense than is deemed necessary,
given the actual danger that the object or situation poses—that is, the fear or anxiety
is greater than is deemed appropriate to the actual danger in the situation. Although
people with specific phobia often recognize their reactions as disproportionate to the
situation, they tend to overestimate the danger in their feared situations, and thus the
judgment of being out of proportion should not be made solely on the basis of self-
report. In DSM-IV, Criterion C required that the individual be aware that the fear or
anxiety was excessive, but stated that this requirement might not be present in chil-
dren. Self-recognition has been removed because many adults deny that their fears
are out of proportion or excessive, and the notation that in children the feature many
be absent has been deleted. This criterion requires that the sociocultural context be
taken into account.

Criterion E

With the duration criterion “typically lasting for 6 months or more” (with text clarifi-
cation that the cutoff should not be applied too rigidly), the overdiagnosis of tran-
sient fears and phobias should be minimized. DSM-IV included a duration criterion


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **131**

(6 months or more) for children under age 18, but this is now extended to all age
groups given the evidence that transient fears and phobias occur in adulthood.

Criterion F

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance needs to result in clinically significant distress or func-
tional impairment. For example, a person who avoids the ferris wheel at a state fair
because of fear of heights may still have a lovely day at the fair and pay little heed to
how this fear affects the experience. Some people cope with their phobias by manip-
ulating their environments (e.g., avoidance of zoos by a person who fears snakes). In
these cases, the impairment would be minimal or nonexistent and the person’s pre-
sentation would not qualify for the diagnosis. If the manipulation of the environment
affects the person’s work, for example, then it may cause significant interference.

Criterion G

Many disorders are characterized by avoidance (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder,
agoraphobia). Specific phobia should be diagnosed only when avoidance is related to
an object or situation and is not accounted for by another disorder.

Specifiers

The specifiers reflect the general categories of phobic stimulus. DSM-5 has removed
reference to fears of contracting an illness in the “other” category because of the relat-
edness of such fears to obsessive-compulsive disorder and to hypochondriasis (which
has been replaced, in DSM-5, by somatic symptom disorder and, in a minority of cases,
illness anxiety disorder).

Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

Social anxiety disorder involves fear of or anxiety about social situations, including situ-
ations that involve scrutiny or contact with strangers. Individuals with this disorder typ-
ically fear embarrassing themselves in social situations, such as while speaking in public
or meeting new people. This disorder can involve specific fears or anxiety about per-
forming certain activities, such as writing, eating, or speaking in front of others. It can
also involve a vague, nonspecific fear of embarrassing oneself or feeling foolish. The cli-
nician should recognize that many individuals exhibit at least some social anxiety or self-
consciousness. Community studies suggest that roughly one-third of all people consider
themselves to be more anxious than other people in social situations. Such anxiety be-
comes a disorder only when the anxiety either prevents the person from participating in
desired activities or causes marked distress in such activities.

Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder
(Social Phobia) **300.23 (F40.10)**

A. Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual
is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions


**132** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
(e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eat-
ing or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech).
Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during inter-
actions with adults.
```
B. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that
will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to
rejection or offend others).
C. The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.

```
Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freez-
ing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations.
```
D. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.
E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation
and to the sociocultural context.
F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.
G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
H. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
I. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another
mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spec-
trum disorder.
J. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, obesity, disfigurement from
burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is ex-
cessive.
Specify if:
**Performance only:** If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.

Criteria A and B

These items cover the three contexts in which social anxiety disorder most commonly
occurs: social interactions, being observed by others, and performing in front of others.
In Criterion B, _humiliation_ and _embarrassment_ have been brought under the broader
phrase “negatively evaluated,” which is the core fear in social anxiety disorder. The
phrase “offend others” has been added to increase cultural sensitivity; in some cul-
tures the underlying fear is the concern that one will make others uncomfortable.

Criterion C

This criterion highlights that social anxiety is a conditioned, stimulus response. In ad-
dition, the criterion clarifies that in children, fear and anxiety may present in a range of
ways (e.g., tantrums).

Criterion D

Although some individuals with social anxiety disorder avoid the contexts that elicit
their anxiety, others endure the anxiety-provoking environments even when the anx-
iety or fear is intense.


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **133**

Criterion E

People with social anxiety disorder often have difficulty recognizing that their fear is
excessive. Therefore, the clinician may be in a better position to judge this. Use of the
phrase “out of proportion to the actual threat posed” is intended to operationalize what
was meant by “excessive or unreasonable” in DSM-IV. Criterion C in DSM-IV included
a note that self-recognition may be absent in children; this note has been deleted. Fi-
nally, the DSM-5 item reminds the clinician to take into account the “sociocultural con-
text.”

Criterion F

The DSM-IV requirement that the duration be 6 months or more in children under age
18 years has now been extended to all age groups, given the data that transient social
anxieties can occur in adulthood as well. This duration criterion helps to minimize
overdiagnosis of transient social anxiety.

Criteria G, H, I, and J

Most individuals experience some social anxiety at some point in their lives. Criterion
G requires that the symptoms cause considerable impairment or distress. This crite-
rion prevents the overdiagnosis of social anxiety disorder.
Many disorders are characterized by fear of social situations. Social anxiety disor-
der should be diagnosed only when the avoidance is not attributable to the effects of
a substance or medication, is not better explained by another mental disorder, and is
not related to another medical condition (Criteria H, I, and I).

Specifiers

Evidence suggests that the “performance only” specifier represents a subset of the
larger social anxiety disorder group with different pathophysiological correlates and
treatment response.

Panic Disorder

Panic disorder is characterized by a pattern of recurrent panic attacks accompanied by
persistent worry or behavioral change. Therefore, individuals with panic disorder ex-
perience anxiety symptoms and functional impairment independent of the actual attack.
The panic attacks occur spontaneously, arising without any trigger or environmental
cue. There has been considerable interest in the relationship between panic disorder
and agoraphobia. Although DSM-IV described panic disorder both with agoraphobia
and without agoraphobia, this distinction is not included in DSM-5 because it was not
meaningful. Panic disorder often co-occurs with a number of mental conditions beyond
agoraphobia, particularly anxiety and depressive disorders.
Panic disorder was included in DSM-III and was recognized as a distinct entity.
From DSM-III through DSM-IV-TR, panic disorder and agoraphobia were tightly
linked. As conceptualized in DSM-IV, agoraphobia invariably involves at least some


**134** DSM-5 Guidebook

form of spontaneous crescendo anxiety, even if such episodes do not meet formal cri-
teria for panic attacks. In the earlier versions of DSM and in ICD-10, agoraphobia is
considered less closely linked to panic disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Panic Disorder **300.01 (F41.0)**

A. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense
fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which
time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur:
**Note:** The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state.

1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.
    2. Sweating.
    3. Trembling or shaking.
    4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.
    5. Feelings of choking.
    6. Chest pain or discomfort.
    7. Nausea or abdominal distress.
    8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint.
    9. Chills or heat sensations.
10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).
11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from
oneself).
12. Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”
13. Fear of dying.
**Note:** Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncon-
trollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as
one of the four required symptoms.

B. At least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 month (or more) of one or both
of the following:

1. Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their conse-
    quences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, “going crazy”).
2. A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., be-
haviors designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance of exercise
or unfamiliar situations).

C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism,
cardiopulmonary disorders).
D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., the panic
attacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety
disorder; in response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific
phobia; in response to obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder; in re-
sponse to reminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or in
response to separation from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **135**

Criteria A and B

Panic disorder requires recurrent and “unexpected” panic attacks, at least one of which
is associated with either persistent concern or worry about additional attacks, or
changes in behavior related to the attacks. Examples are provided to help the clinician
understand the functional impact of the attacks.

Criteria C and D

Panic disorder must be differentiated from medical conditions that produce similar
symptoms. Panic attacks have been associated with a variety of endocrinological dis-
orders, including both hypo- and hyperthyroid states, hyperparathyroidism, and
pheochromocytomas. Episodic hypoglycemia can also produce panic symptoms. Sei-
zure disorders, vestibular dysfunction, neoplasms, prescribed and illicit substances,
and cardiac and pulmonary problems (e.g., arrhythmias, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, asthma) can all result in panic symptoms. Clues to an underlying medical
cause for panic symptoms include atypical features during panic attacks, such as ataxia,
alterations in consciousness, or bladder dyscontrol; onset of panic disorder relatively
late in life; or physical signs and symptoms indicating a medical condition.
Panic disorder also must be differentiated from a number of mental disorders,
particularly other anxiety states. Differentiation from generalized anxiety disorder
can sometimes be difficult, but classic panic attacks are characterized by rapid onset
and short duration, in contrast to the anxiety associated with generalized anxiety dis-
order, which emerges and dissipates more slowly. Anxiety also frequently accompa-
nies many other psychiatric disorders, including psychotic and mood disorders.

Panic Attack Specifier

A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear or discomfort lasting minutes to
hours that triggers uncomfortable physical sensations. Panic attacks usually begin
abruptly, peak within minutes, and can be frightening to the individual. When they
occur, the person may believe he or she is losing control, having a heart attack, or even
dying. Although many people have isolated panic attacks during stressful times,
these attacks do not occur repeatedly. Panic attacks may occur in various psycho-
pathological states.
Freud’s description of anxiety neurosis was defined by the coexistence of a state
of moderate and permanent anxiety and of anxiety attacks, whose manifestations
were similar to today’s panic attack. Anxiety neurosis was later subdivided into the
acute anxiety attack (i.e., a panic attack) and a state of moderate and continuous anx-
iety (now referred to as generalized anxiety disorder). This distinction was included
in the Research Diagnostic Criteria (Spitzer et al. 1975) and appeared a few years later
in DSM-III.
Importantly, as stated in DSM-5, panic attacks can be noted as a specifier for any
anxiety disorder as well as for other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders,
posttraumatic stress disorder) and some medical conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory,
vestibular, gastrointestinal). When the presence of a panic attack is identified, it


**136** DSM-5 Guidebook

should be documented with the specifier “with panic attacks” (e.g., posttraumatic
stress disorder with panic attacks).

Panic Attack Specifier

**Note:** Symptoms are presented for the purpose of identifying a panic attack; however,
panic attack is not a mental disorder and cannot be coded. Panic attacks can occur in
the context of any anxiety disorder as well as other mental disorders (e.g., depressive
disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders) and some medical
conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal). When the presence
of a panic attack is identified, it should be noted as a specifier (e.g., “posttraumatic
stress disorder with panic attacks”). For panic disorder, the presence of panic attack is
contained within the criteria for the disorder and panic attack is not used as a specifier.

An abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within min-
utes, and during which time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur:
**Note:** The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state.

1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.
2. Sweating.
3. Trembling or shaking.
4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.
5. Feelings of choking.
6. Chest pain or discomfort.
7. Nausea or abdominal distress.
8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint.
9. Chills or heat sensations.
10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).
11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from
oneself).
12. Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”
13. Fear of dying.

**Note:** Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrol-
lable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one of
the four required symptoms.

By itself, a panic attack is not a codable disorder. Episodes of abrupt fear occur in
many situations. A healthy person might experience a panic attack when confronted
with sudden extreme danger, and an individual with a phobia of heights might expe-
rience a panic attack when confronted with the feared situation. DSM-5 requires that
panic attacks be listed as a specifier to the specific disorder with which they occur. The
importance of the specifier is based on data demonstrating that panic attacks predict
the severity of other forms of psychopathology. A person who meets at least four of
the symptoms qualifies as having a panic attack. Data from the DSM-IV field trial
confirmed that the four-symptom threshold is optimal.
Although the DSM-5 symptoms are unchanged from DSM-IV, they are now rank-
ordered from most to least common. In addition, “heat sensations” replaces the DSM-IV


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **137**

symptom “hot flushes.” The concluding note is included to increase clinician aware-
ness of culture-based symptoms. For example, higher rates of paresthesias occur in
African Americans, trembling in Caribbean Latinos, and depersonalization/dereal-
ization in Puerto Ricans.

Agoraphobia

Agoraphobia was first identified by Westphal in the late 19th century when he de-
scribed people who feared public places (Goodwin and Guze 1989). DSM-III intro-
duced and codified agoraphobia as a distinctive syndrome characterized by “marked
fear and avoidance of being alone or in public places from which escape might be dif-
ficult or help not available in case of sudden incapacitations” (p. 226). In DSM-III-R,
agoraphobia was specifically defined as a classically conditioned response to panic
attacks. Although agoraphobia could be diagnosed in the absence of a history of
panic attacks, such an occurrence was thought to be rare. Therefore, agoraphobia be-
came conceptually linked to panic attacks, but was also seen explicitly and exclu-
sively as a secondary complication. In DSM-IV, agoraphobia could be diagnosed only
within the context of panic disorder or as the result of panic attacks or panic-like
symptoms (i.e., agoraphobia was related to fear of developing panic symptoms such
as dizziness or diarrhea). In community samples, however, the majority of people
with agoraphobia never experienced panic attacks or panic-like symptoms or psycho-
physiological symptoms of other types that clearly preceded the onset of agoraphobic
avoidance. In DSM-5, agoraphobia is a codable disorder independent of panic disor-
der or panic attacks (Wittchen et al. 2010).

Diagnostic Criteria for Agoraphobia **300.22 (F40.00)**

A. Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the following five situations:

1. Using public transportation (e.g., automobiles, buses, trains, ships, planes).
2. Being in open spaces (e.g., parking lots, marketplaces, bridges).
3. Being in enclosed places (e.g., shops, theaters, cinemas).
4. Standing in line or being in a crowd.
5. Being outside of the home alone.

B. The individual fears or avoids these situations because of thoughts that escape
might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like
symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear of falling
in the elderly; fear of incontinence).
C. The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.
D. The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the presence of a com-
panion, or are endured with intense fear or anxiety.
E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agora-
phobic situations and to the sociocultural context.
F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.
G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.


**138** DSM-5 Guidebook

H. If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson’s dis-
ease) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly excessive.
I. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another
mental disorder—for example, the symptoms are not confined to specific phobia,
situational type; do not involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder);
and are not related exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disor-
der), perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance (as in body dysmorphic dis-
order), reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear
of separation (as in separation anxiety disorder).

**Note:** Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic disorder. If an
individual’s presentation meets criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diag-
noses should be assigned.

Criterion A

The person with agoraphobia must report fear or anxiety arising from at least two of the
five general situations listed. The requirement of at least two such situations differentiates
agoraphobia from a specific phobia, which may be limited to one particular situation.
Also, the fear or anxiety is related exclusively to the situations and is not attributable to
more generalized anxiety that the person experiences in multiple situations.

Criterion B

The diagnosis of agoraphobia requires the person to have a cognitive ideational com-
ponent related to the fear or avoidance. This criterion emphasizes the motivation for
the avoidance, such as fear that escape will be difficult. In addition, the cognitive as-
pect of agoraphobia can be associated with fear or avoidance of the situation because
of thoughts that “help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like
symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear of falling in
the elderly; fear of incontinence),” and thereby allows for the diagnosis in the absence
of panic-like symptoms.

Criterion C

This criterion requires that the situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety and
therefore raises the threshold for making the diagnosis. A single or even occasional
event of avoiding situations due to fear would not qualify for the diagnosis.

Criterion D

DSM-5 includes the phrase “actively avoided” to minimize overdiagnosis of mild fears.

Criterion E

This criterion is new and is used to increase reliability and separation from normal fears.
The criterion evokes clinician judgment (vs. self-recognition). For example, a person with
a history of incontinence may refuse to leave home for long stretches of time, and that


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **139**

may be reasonable. If the person had only a single episode of incontinence and has re-
fused to leave home for years, then that would be out of proportion to the fear.

Criterion F

To avoid overdiagnosis of transient fear or anxiety, the duration is indicated as typi-
cally for 6 months or more. This was previously not a requirement.

Criteria G, H, and I

The degree of impairment associated with agoraphobia can vary from only avoiding sit-
uations to being entirely housebound (Criterion G). This criterion is intended to increase
separation of individuals with agoraphobia from those with mild or transient fears.
The core feature of agoraphobia is avoidance, a symptom that may be present in
a number of other disorders. The clinician should rule out other medical conditions
(e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) in which avoidance behavior may be present (Cri-
terion H). Other mental disorders also need to be ruled out (e.g., obsessive-compulsive
disorder) (Criterion I).

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by a pattern of frequent, persistent exces-
sive anxiety and worry that is out of proportion to the impact of the event or circum-
stance that is the focus of the worry. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may
not acknowledge the excessive nature of their worry, but they are bothered by their de-
gree of worry. This pattern of worry occurs “more days than not for at least 6 months”
(Criterion A). Individuals find it difficult to control this worry and report at least three
of six somatic or cognitive symptoms (or one symptom for children).
Generalized anxiety disorder was first included in DSM-III, having been split off
from anxiety neurosis. The disorder was originally considered a diagnosis of exclu-
sion, because it could not be “attributable to another mental disorder.” DSM-III also
required a 1-month duration of symptoms, but concerns later arose about the low re-
liability of the diagnosis. In DSM-III-R, the duration was increased to 6 months and the
symptom list was expanded. DSM-III-R also removed some of the hierarchical rules
that had limited the diagnosis to individuals in whom the symptoms were not due to
another disorder. Finally, in DSM-IV the list of associated symptoms was simplified
from 18 to 6, of which individuals had to exhibit at least 3. More emphasis was placed
on the pervasiveness of the worry, and the criteria were modified to accommodate child-
hood presentations. DSM-IV attempted to integrate the approach to worry across devel-
opment. In DSM-5, the diagnosis is mostly unchanged from that in DSM-IV except for
wording changes and a reorganization of the criteria.

Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder **300.02 (F41.1)**

A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days
than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work
or school performance).


**140** DSM-5 Guidebook

B. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.
C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six
symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than
not for the past 6 months):
**Note:** Only one item is required in children.

1. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge.
2. Being easily fatigued.
3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.
4. Irritability.
5. Muscle tension.
6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying
    sleep).

D. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).
F. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or
worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anx-
iety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-com-
pulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder,
reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in an-
orexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appear-
ance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety
disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).

Criteria A and B

Generalized anxiety disorder is not the same as normal worry, and these criteria are
intended to distinguish the two. Worries considered sufficient for the disorder must
be excessive. An evaluation of the intensity, frequency, and focus of worries provides
clues to whether the anxiety is excessive. The minimum duration requirement of 6
months is set high enough to distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from episodic
or short-lived events that cause worry. Furthermore, the person finds it difficult to
control the worry.

Criterion C

This item includes both somatic and cognitive aspects of generalized anxiety disor-
der. The requirement of three or more symptoms for adults and one for children is un-
changed from DSM-IV.

Criterion D

This criterion establishes a threshold by which normal worry will not become pathol-
ogized. The requirement that the worry cause significant distress or impairment should
prevent an individual from receiving this diagnosis unless the worry is severe.


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **141**

Criteria E and F

Anxiety is a frequent symptom of substance use and of several medical conditions,
which must be ruled out. Anxiety or worry is also a defining or associated feature of
many mental disorders. Criterion F provides examples of worries covered by other
diagnoses and thereby reserves the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder to those
worries not covered by other conditions. An additional diagnosis of generalized anx-
iety disorder, however, may be appropriate when the worries extend beyond the spe-
cific symptoms of another disorder.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Anxiety Disorder

For individuals with a substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, clinically sig-
nificant symptoms of panic, worry, phobia, or obsessions emerge in the context of
prescribed or illicit substance use. The differential diagnosis requires that substance
use and medications be ruled out as possible causes of anxiety before one of the other
anxiety disorders is diagnosed. Clinicians should routinely document the substance
use status of all patients and record all medications.
Clinicians should be particularly attuned to substance misuse when encountering
an anxious individual. If misuse is present, the clinician must then determine whether
it has any relationship to the ongoing anxiety symptoms. Although no definitive test
exists to establish such a causal relationship, several factors can help confirm the di-
agnosis. These include the timing of the symptoms, the existing literature pertaining
to the strength of the association between anxiety and the potential complicating fac-
tor, and signs or symptoms that are atypical of an anxiety disorder.
Onset of anxiety symptoms may occur during substance intoxication or withdrawal,
and onset of such symptoms is indicated by use of specifiers. Anxiety is associated
with multiple illicit substances (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine), alcohol, and caffeine.
The diagnosis can also be made when the anxiety is associated with use of prescrip-
tion drugs (e.g., anticholinergics, antidepressants, lithium). A diagnosis of substance-
induced anxiety disorder rather than substance intoxication or withdrawal is appropri-
ate when the anxiety symptoms predominate and are in excess of what is expected and
warrant independent clinical attention.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Anxiety Disorder

A. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
    Criterion A.


**142** DSM-5 Guidebook

C. The disturbance is not better explained by an anxiety disorder that is not sub-
stance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent anxiety disorder
could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the ces-
sation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-in-
duced anxiety disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-
related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/med-
ication]-induced anxiety disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-
10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the
clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced
anxiety disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced anxiety disor-
der”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-
induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should
record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” de-
pending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comor-
bid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then
the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-
induced anxiety disorder.

Specify if (see 16–1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-
agnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** This specifier applies if criteria are met for intox-
ication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
**With onset during withdrawal:** This specifier applies if criteria are met for withdraw-
al from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.
**With onset after medication use:** Symptoms may appear either at initiation of
medication or after a modification or change in use.

Anxiety Disorder Due to

Another Medical Condition

Anxiety symptoms can develop in the context of identifiable medical syndromes. En-
docrine conditions (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia), cardiovascular conditions
(e.g., arrhythmia, congestive heart failure), respiratory diseases (e.g., chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, pneumonia), neurological conditions (e.g., neoplasms, en-
cephalitis), and metabolic conditions (e.g., vitamin B 12 deficiency) all may be
associated with anxiety. If another medical condition is present and determined to be
the direct physiological cause of the anxiety symptoms, then anxiety disorder due to
another medical condition should be diagnosed. When recording the diagnosis, the
clinician should include the name of the other medical condition within the name of
the mental disorder (e.g., 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma).
The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately be-
fore the anxiety disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 227.0 [D35.00] pheochro-
mocytoma; 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma).

the anxiety disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 227.0 [D35.00] pheochromo-
cytoma; 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma.

Other Specified Anxiety Disorder and

Unspecified Anxiety Disorder

Because anxiety represents one of the most common psychiatric symptoms, it is not un-
common to encounter individuals who have impairment from anxiety but whose symp-
toms do not meet criteria for one of the specific anxiety disorders. These individuals are
appropriately classified as having an other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder.
The categories replace DSM-IV’s anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. Other
specified anxiety disorder is used when symptoms characteristic of an anxiety disor-
der are present and cause distress or impairment but do not meet the full criteria for
a more specific disorder in the class. The category is used when the clinician chooses
to communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet full criteria. The clini-
cian is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., limited-symptom attacks).
The category unspecified anxiety disorder is used when the individual’s symp-
toms do not meet full criteria for a more specific disorder that causes distress or im-
pairment, and the clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met
or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Anxiety Disorder **300.09 (F41.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
of the disorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The other specified anxiety dis-
order category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the
specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific anxiety
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified anxiety disorder” followed by the spe-
cific reason (e.g., “generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Limited-symptom attacks.**
2. **Generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not.**
3. **Khyâl cap (wind attacks):** See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the
    Appendix to DSM-5.
4. **Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves):** See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Dis-
    tress” in the Appendix to DSM-5.


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **145**

Unspecified Anxiety Disorder **300.00 (F41.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
any of the disorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified anxiety
disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the
reason that the criteria are not met for a specific anxiety disorder, and includes pre-
sentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis
(e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- The anxiety disorders class no longer includes obsessive-compulsive disorder,
    posttraumatic stress disorder, or acute stress disorder. Separation anxiety dis-
    order and selective mutism have been added to the class. The wording of the
    former has been changed to more adequately represent the expression of sep-
    aration anxiety symptoms in adulthood.
- For specific phobia and social anxiety disorder, changes to the criteria include
    deletion of the requirement that adults recognize their anxiety as excessive or
    unreasonable. Instead, the anxiety should be “out of proportion” to the actual
    danger or threat, after sociocultural factors are taken into account. The typical
    minimum 6-month duration, which was limited to individuals younger than age
    18 years, has been extended to persons of all ages.
- The specific phobia criteria are reworded so that the chance of encountering the
    phobic stimulus is no longer a determinant of whether an individual receives the
    diagnosis. The different stimulus types of specific phobias (now specifiers) are
    mostly unchanged.
- With social anxiety disorder, the “generalized” specifier has been dropped and
    replaced with a “performance only” specifier.
- Panic disorder and agoraphobia have been unlinked. The specifier “with panic
    attacks” can be used for any anxiety disorder, other mental disorders, and some
    medical conditions.

## The chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders is new to

DSM-5 and brings together disorders previously classified in DSM-IV with the anxi-
ety disorders (obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]), somatoform disorders (body
dysmorphic disorder), and impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified
(trichotillomania). The chapter represents a departure from DSM-IV but shows conti-
nuity with the approach taken by the DSM-5 Task Force to group related disorders to-
gether. Relatedness is a fundamental concept underlying any classification system.
The placement of these disorders in DSM-IV had been criticized because of the per-
ceived failure to recognize the similarities among them. Evidence has accumulated
showing the various disorders’ relatedness to OCD in terms of shared phenomenol-
ogy, patterns of familial aggregation, and etiological mechanisms (Hollander et al.
2011). With these disorders now grouped together, clinicians are encouraged to screen
for these conditions and consider their overlap. Finally, the metastructure of DSM-5
is reflected by the placement of this chapter following the one on anxiety disorders.
The obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (Table 7–1) are unified by the pres-
ence of obsessions (recurrent and persistent intrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges,


**148** DSM-5 Guidebook

or images that lead to marked anxiety or distress) and/or compulsive rituals (repeti-
tive behaviors or mental acts performed in a habitual or stereotyped manner) that
cause significant functional impairment in important life domains. These disorders
are relatively common, with OCD having a lifetime prevalence of 1.6%–3%, and the other
disorders in this chapter having estimated prevalence rates ranging from 1% to 5%.
OCD is one of the top causes of global disability according to the World Health Orga-
nization (2001).

Hoarding—long considered a subtype of OCD—is now accorded its own diagno-
sis, in response to research showing that it has unique features, symptom patterns,
and treatment response. Body dysmorphic disorder has been moved from the DSM-
IV chapter “Somatoform Disorders” in recognition of its close relationship with OCD.
Trichotillomania has been renamed “trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)” and
has been moved from the DSM-IV chapter “Impulse-Control Disorders Not Else-
where Classified.” Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, long considered an impulsive
disorder similar to trichotillomania, is new (Stein et al. 2010).

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

The hallmark of OCD is the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. _Obsessions_ are
recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intru-
sive and unwanted and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress (e.g.,
fears of germs and contamination). _Compulsions_ are repetitive and intentional behaviors
or mental acts performed in response to obsessions or according to certain rules that
must be applied rigidly (e.g., repetitive hand washing, ritualistic checking). Compul-
sions are meant to neutralize or reduce the person’s discomfort or prevent a dreaded
event or situation. The rituals are not connected in a realistic way to the event or situa-
tion or are clearly excessive. The specific definitions for obsessions and compulsions
have treatment implications because each requires a different approach.
First described clinically by Esquirol (1838), OCD was considered a form of mono-
mania, or partial insanity. Esquirol described how disturbed patients would ruminate
on a central theme, giving it their full attention. Later, obsessive-compulsive symp-


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **149**

toms were attributed to depression, but this gave way to their acceptance as a neu-
rotic syndrome. Freud (1895/1962) drew upon his concepts of mental structure and
described _obsessional neurosis,_ a syndrome in which the person struggles with unac-
ceptable impulses (obsessions) and attempts to control them through imperfect de-
fenses that result in rituals (compulsions). Psychoanalytic ideas held sway until
advances in neuroscience and learning theory led to a more useful reconceptualiza-
tion of OCD. As for formal classification, DSM-I included “obsessive compulsive re-
action,” giving rise to “obsessive compulsive neurosis” in DSM-II:

```
This disorder is characterized by the persistent intrusion of unwanted thoughts, urges,
or actions that the patient is unable to stop. The thoughts may consist of single words
or ideas, ruminations, or trains of thought often perceived by the patient as nonsensical.
The actions vary from simple movements to complex rituals such as repeated hand
washing. Anxiety and distress are often present either if the patient is prevented from
completing his compulsive ritual or if he is concerned about being unable to control it
himself. (p. 40)
```
The disorder was included in the Feighner criteria (Feighner et al. 1972), which be-
came the basis for the DSM-III criteria. The criteria were slightly modified for DSM-
III-R and DSM-IV. The DSM-5 criteria have been further refined to reflect the field’s
greater understanding of this disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder **300.3 (F42)**

A. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both:

```
Obsessions are defined by (1) and (2):
```
1. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at
    some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most
    individuals cause marked anxiety or distress.
2. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images,
or to neutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e., by performing a
compulsion).
Compulsions are defined by (1) and (2):
1. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts
(e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven
to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be ap-
plied rigidly.
2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or
distress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behav-
iors or mental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are de-
signed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive.
**Note:** Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these behaviors
or mental acts.
B. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour
per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation-
al, or other important areas of functioning.


**150** DSM-5 Guidebook

C. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
D. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disor-
der (e.g., excessive worries, as in generalized anxiety disorder; preoccupation with
appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with
possessions, as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania [hair-pull-
ing disorder]; skin picking, as in excoriation [skin-picking] disorder; stereotypies, as
in stereotypic movement disorder; ritualized eating behavior, as in eating disorders;
preoccupation with substances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictive
disorders; preoccupation with having an illness, as in illness anxiety disorder; sex-
ual urges or fantasies, as in paraphilic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-
control, and conduct disorders; guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder;
thought insertion or delusional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorders; or repetitive patterns of behavior, as in autism spectrum
disorder).

Specify if:
**With good or fair insight:** The individual recognizes that obsessive-compulsive
disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be
true.
**With poor insight:** The individual thinks obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs
are probably true.
**With absent insight/delusional beliefs:** The individual is completely convinced
that obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true.

Specify if:
**Tic-related:** The individual has a current or past history of a tic disorder.

Criterion A

Instead of four features defining an obsession, as in DSM-IV, DSM-5 relies on two: 1)
“recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some
time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals
cause marked anxiety or distress,” and 2) attempts to “ignore or suppress such thoughts,
urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.”

**Obsessions**

**Criterion A1.** The wording of Criterion A1 has changed from “recurrent and persis-
tent thoughts, _impulses,_ or images” to “recurrent and persistent thoughts, _urges,_ or im-
ages.” Both _impulse_ and _urge_ capture the involuntary (losing control) nature of some
obsessions. However, _impulse_ indirectly refers to the notion of impulse-control disor-
ders, which may complicate differential diagnosis. For example, someone with klep-
tomania may report recurrent impulses to steal, and so the criteria for OCD would
potentially be met. The change in wording in this criterion, in addition to a larger ex-
clusionary list in Criterion D, is aimed at preventing this misdiagnosis. Interestingly,
_urge_ was a descriptor used in DSM-II.
Additionally, the DSM-IV definition of _obsession_ stated that the thoughts are “experi-
enced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and _inappropriate._ ” In DSM-5,


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **151**

the last word has been changed to _unwanted_. Replacing _inappropriate_ with _unwanted_ at-
tempts to address the difficulties in operationalizing the ego-dystonic quality of ob-
sessional thoughts. In DSM-III, the term _ego-dystonic_ was used to reflect the belief that
obsessional thoughts are involuntary and regarded as senseless or repugnant. In DSM-
III-R, _ego-dystonic_ was replaced with _senseless_. In DSM-IV, _senseless_ was dropped be-
cause the term could imply a loss of reality testing and thereby confuse OCD with psy-
choses. Also, the term _inappropriate_ may have different definitions based on culture,
gender, and age; use of the term _unwanted_ in DSM-5 seeks to avoid these social and cul-
tural differences that may complicate the diagnosis.
The final change in the DSM-5 definition of obsession is the addition of “in most
individuals” before the phrase “cause marked anxiety or distress.” Data from several
large studies show that although most people with OCD experience at least moderate
anxiety or distress from obsessional thoughts, not all obsessions generate marked
anxiety or distress. In addition, some people who have experienced OCD for many
years may not report the same level of anxiety or distress from their obsessions as
they did at illness onset.

**Criterion A2.** Many DSM-5 disorders are characterized by repetitive thoughts or
behaviors, and these must be distinguished from obsessions and compulsions. The
statement that the person attempts to ignore or suppress the obsessive thoughts,
urges, or images, or to neutralize them by performing a compulsion, provides a func-
tional link between obsessions and compulsions. This link allows the clinician to dis-
tinguish the thoughts of OCD from those found in anxiety disorders such as
generalized anxiety disorder _because_ of the presence of compulsions. Although not
everyone with OCD reports obsessions _and_ compulsions, the vast majority (approxi-
mately 90%) do so.
In DSM-5, two DSM-IV criteria have been deleted from the definition of obsession:
that the thoughts are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems (A2) and
that the person recognizes that the thoughts are a product of his or her own mind
(A4). These criteria were originally used to distinguish OCD from generalized anxiety
disorder (e.g., a person worrying excessively about financial problems when out of
work) and from psychotic disorders (e.g., when a person believes someone has in-
serted these thoughts into his or her head). In DSM-5, instead of being used to define
an obsession, these criteria have been incorporated into Criterion D, which includes
information about the differential diagnosis between OCD, generalized anxiety dis-
order, psychotic disorders, and other mental disorders.

**Compulsions**

**Criterion A1.** Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that a person feels driven to per-
form. The “feels driven” aspect of the behavior reflects that the behavior is not willed,
purposeful, or intentional.

**Criterion A2.** The definition of compulsion requires that the person’s motivation
for the behavior be to reduce or prevent anxiety or distress associated with an obses-
sive thought. For example, a person may need to write a sentence over and over again


**152** DSM-5 Guidebook

as a means of reducing the anxiety associated with “just right” obsessions. Another
example is when a person asks forgiveness multiple times to reduce the distress from
an obsessive thought of violence. This requirement that the compulsion be designed
to reduce anxiety or distress from an obsession helps to differentiate the behavior
from repetitive behaviors seen in tics or stereotypies.
The requirement that the compulsive behavior be designed to reduce a negative
feeling triggered by an obsessive thought also differentiates OCD from repetitive be-
haviors seen in impulsive or addictive disorders. The motivating drive behind impulsive
or addictive behaviors is generally, although not exclusively, the pleasure or gratifi-
cation associated with the behavior.
The second criterion further defines compulsive behaviors as those that are “not
connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or
are clearly excessive.” For example, most people consider it advisable to check that
the iron is unplugged and lights are off before leaving home. Checking once or twice
is prudent, whereas checking multiple times is clearly excessive. The extremes, such as
checking 30 times, are much easier to recognize than the “gray areas” of checking (e.g.,
four times).

Criterion B

DSM-IV’s Criterion B has been deleted from DSM-5. It stated that during the course
of illness, “the person has recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are exces-
sive or unreasonable.” Because _excessive_ and _unreasonable_ were not defined or opera-
tionalized, it was unclear how clinicians and researchers should interpret the terms.
DSM-5 Criterion B is a modified version of DSM-IV Criterion C. Given that most
people have some obsessive thoughts or engage in repetitive behaviors, this criterion
gives the clinician a general threshold for when thoughts or behaviors may be consid-
ered problematic and not normative. The time threshold should be considered an ap-
proximation for when these thoughts or behaviors have become excessive, which is
why the phrase “take more than 1 hour per day” has been added as an example. Many
people with OCD rationalize that their behavior is useful; they also may present with
an apparent lack of concern over the behavior or lack insight regarding the impact of
these symptoms on their lives. Ritualistic behaviors that consume more than 1 hour
per day are not necessarily evidence of OCD. For example, a surgeon may wash her
hands more than 1 hour each day, and yet this should not be taken as evidence of OCD.

Criterion C

This item mirrors DSM-IV Criterion E, with minor edits, and is intended to remind
clinicians to distinguish OCD from obsessions or compulsions that occur in relation
to substance use or a medical condition. For example, people who misuse stimulants
(e.g., amphetamines) sometimes report compulsive skin picking. Likewise, individu-
als treated with dopaminergic medications (e.g., pramipexole) for Parkinson’s dis-
ease often exhibit “punding” behaviors, which are repetitive mechanical tasks, such
as sorting, collecting, or assembling/disassembling common items. An OCD diagno-
sis is not appropriate in these cases.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **153**

Criterion D

Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by recurrent, intrusive thoughts and/or re-
petitive behaviors. This criterion clarifies the instances in which the diagnosis of OCD
would not be appropriate. DSM-5 has expanded the list of diagnoses with symptoms
that may resemble those in OCD, to include disorders such as major depressive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, illness anxiety disorder, impulse-control disorders, hoard-
ing disorder, excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, and paraphilic disorders.

Specifiers

The subtyping of OCD has been expanded to allow clinicians to make a more detailed
assessment of the individual and his or her disorder (Leckman et al. 2010). Instead of
the single specifier “with poor insight,” as in DSM-IV, DSM-5 includes a range of in-
sight specifiers (good or fair, poor, absent), as well as a specifier of tic-related OCD.
Because insight may fluctuate over time, the insight specifier has been changed to re-
fer to the current presentation. The revised specifiers have the potential advantage of
conveying the broad range of insight that can characterize OCD beliefs, including de-
lusional beliefs. Insight may be associated with clinical presentation (e.g., greater
OCD severity, higher rates of co-occurring depression) and treatment outcome (e.g.,
less robust treatment response to cognitive-behavioral therapy).
Research evidence provides support for the inclusion of a tic-related specifier. This
OCD variant is highly familial with specific clinical characteristics (early onset, male
predominance) and high rates of symmetry and exactness obsessions and of ordering
and arranging compulsions, as well as sensory phenomena. Individuals with symp-
toms characteristic of this specifier may also benefit differentially from antipsychotic
augmentation if treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor does not suf-
ficiently reduce the symptoms.

Body Dysmorphic Disorder

Body dysmorphic disorder requires both obsessional thoughts regarding perceived
defects in appearance and, at some point, compulsive behaviors that develop in re-
sponse to those thoughts. Body dysmorphic disorder and OCD have many similarities—
symptoms, aspects of treatment response, comorbidities, and perhaps underlying
pathophysiology. They also have important differences; for example, people with body
dysmorphic disorder have poorer insight and are more likely to have suicidal ide-
ation and co-occurring substance use disorders.
The condition has been referred to in the past as _dysmorphophobia._ Body dysmor-
phic disorder was included in DSM-III as an example of an atypical somatoform disor-
der and received full disorder status in DSM-III-R. DSM-IV continued to include body
dysmorphic disorder with the somatoform disorders. The relocation of body dysmor-
phic disorder to the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders reflects research re-
garding its etiological relationship with OCD (Phillips et al. 2010).
Body dysmorphic disorder is relatively common, with prevalence rates in the general
population of 0.7%–2.4%, although studies of clinical samples suggest higher rates: 3%–


**154** DSM-5 Guidebook

16% among cosmetic surgery patients, 9%–15% among dermatology patients, 8%–12%
among patients with OCD, and 39% among patients with anorexia nervosa.

Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder **300.7 (F45.22)**

A. Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance
that are not observable or appear slight to others. 
B. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed re-
petitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reas-
surance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that
of others) in response to the appearance concerns.
C. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat
or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating
disorder.

Specify if:
**With muscle dysmorphia:** The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or
her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if
the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case.

Specify if:
Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., “I look ugly”
or “I look deformed”).

```
With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic
disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be
true.
With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs
are probably true.
With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced
that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true.
```
Criterion A

Persons with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with the idea that some as-
pect or aspects of their appearance look abnormal. They may describe these areas as
being unattractive, deformed, disfigured, ugly, hideous, or “not right.” The face or
head is commonly the body area that troubles these individuals, with a focus on skin
flaws, defects, blemishes, wrinkles, scars, or supposed acne. Typically, these individ-
uals are preoccupied with their appearance for several hours each day. DSM-5 has
changed the initial criterion from preoccupation with an “imagined defect in appear-
ance” to preoccupation with “perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that
are not observable or appear slight to others.” This clarifies the criterion’s meaning,
and eliminating the term _imagined_ prevents clinicians from characterizing the disor-
der as due to psychosis.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **155**

Criterion B

All people with body dysmorphic disorder have at some point in their illness per-
formed repetitive, time-consuming behaviors in response to their preoccupations.
These behaviors focus on examining, improving, being reassured about, or hiding the
perceived defect. These behaviors are often described as “compulsive” in the sense
that the urge to perform them is strong and difficult to resist. They are also sometimes
referred to as “safety behaviors,” meaning that they are performed to prevent a feared
catastrophe (e.g., camouflaging “ghostlike” skin with bronzer to prevent feared scru-
tiny by other people).

Criterion C

This item recognizes that individuals with body dysmorphic disorder experience
clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning
because of their appearance concerns. They also have poor quality of life; about 25%
of individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are so distressed that they attempt sui-
cide. However, severity varies, with some individuals appearing to lead relatively
normal lives despite the distress and interference they experience.

Criterion D

Body dysmorphic disorder must be distinguished from eating disorders. Body dys-
morphic disorder and anorexia nervosa, for example, share disturbed body image
and a preoccupation with perceived appearance flaws. Many individuals with an-
orexia nervosa are preoccupied with aspects of appearance other than weight, such
as the size of the stomach or thighs, or even body areas such as the skin or nose. Con-
versely, some individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with body
weight and body shape. Although anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder
have similarities, as well as some overlap, they also appear to have some important
differences, including gender distribution (more individuals with anorexia nervosa
are female), comorbidity, patterns of familial aggregation of psychiatric disorders, and
response to treatment.

Specifiers

In DSM-5, specifiers regarding whether the body dysmorphic disorder focuses on
one’s body build (muscle dysmorphia, defined as preoccupation with the idea that
one’s body is too small or not muscular enough) and insight have been added.
Muscle dysmorphia appears to have several important differences from other
forms of body dysmorphic disorder (e.g., higher rates of suicidal behavior, comorbid
substance use disorders), and the treatment approach may require some modifica-
tion. Thus, adding this specifier may have clinical utility.
Although the majority of individuals with body dysmorphic disorder also have
ideas of reference (thinking that others notice their imagined defect and react to it with
dislike or disgust), there appear to be far more similarities than differences between de-
lusional and nondelusional body dysmorphic disorder. The insight specifier reflects the


**156** DSM-5 Guidebook

broad range of insight (including delusional thinking) that can characterize body dys-
morphic disorder beliefs. These levels of insight are similar to categories in widely used
scales for body dysmorphic disorder, and they are the same as those for OCD.

Hoarding Disorder

Hoarding is a persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions. The accu-
mulation of possessions makes it hard to use living areas of the home for their in-
tended purposes (Frost et al. 2012; Mataix-Cols et al. 2010). The hoarding causes
clinically significant distress or impairment. Hoarding is surprisingly common and
potentially disabling. Significant hoarding has been shown to occur in 2%–6% of the
general population. Prior to DSM-5, hoarding was mentioned in DSM-IV only in the
context of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (Item 5), but the related text
suggests that serious hoarding behavior should be considered a form of OCD. The high
prevalence and serious consequences of hoarding disorder, together with research on
its distinctiveness from OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, have
led the authors of DSM-5 to classify it as an independent disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Hoarding Disorder **300.3 (F42)**

A. Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual
value.
B. This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associ-
ated with discarding them.
C. The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions
that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their in-
tended use. If living areas are uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of
third parties (e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities).
D. The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning (including maintaining a safe envi-
ronment for self and others).
E. The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., brain injury,
cerebrovascular disease, Prader-Willi syndrome).
F. The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder
(e.g., obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, decreased energy in major
depressive disorder, delusions in schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder,
cognitive deficits in major neurocognitive disorder, restricted interests in autism
spectrum disorder).

Specify if:
**With excessive acquisition:** If difficulty discarding possessions is accompanied by
excessive acquisition of items that are not needed or for which there is no available
space.

Specify if:
**With good or fair insight:** The individual recognizes that hoarding-related beliefs
and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acqui-
sition) are problematic.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **157**

```
With poor insight : The individual is mostly convinced that hoarding-related beliefs
and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acqui-
sition) are not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.
With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced
that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding
items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are not problematic despite evidence to the
contrary.
```
Criterion A

The desire to retain objects of value, either sentimental or financial, is common. With
hoarding disorder, the difficulty with discarding possessions seems driven by fears of
losing important things. Criterion A refers to the core characteristic, which is diffi-
culty discarding. The wording “discarding or parting with” is intended to make clear
that this difficulty is not confined to throwing things away, but rather to any attempt
to let go of a possession, including giving it away, recycling it, or selling it. The second
clause, “regardless of their actual value,” distinguishes this definition from that used
to define hoarding as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder in
DSM-IV, in which the hoarding was defined as being “unable to discard worn-out or
worthless objects.” What is considered worthless or worn out varies considerably
from person to person. The most frequently hoarded items include clothes, newspa-
pers, and magazines. Many of these items, especially clothes, are frequently new and
never worn.

Criterion B

A central feature of hoarding disorder is the need to save possessions. Clutter that re-
sults is due to purposeful saving and reluctance to discard items because they have
sentimental significance, are potentially useful, or have intrinsic aesthetic value. The
nature of emotional attachment is reflected in the person’s reaction to getting rid of a
possession; the emotion experienced is either anxiety or a feeling of grief at the loss.
Associated with this is the tendency to assign humanlike qualities to possessions. An-
other form of emotional attachment concerns a sense of comfort and security pro-
vided by possessions. The thought of getting rid of a possession appears to violate
feelings of safety.

Criterion C

The major consequence of hoarding is disorganized clutter, which elicits great con-
cern from family and friends. Clutter makes a space unusable or unsanitary, and find-
ing important items may be nearly impossible. This criterion emphasizes the living
areas of the home or workspace rather than locations such as attics, basements, or ga-
rages, which are sometimes cluttered in homes of persons without hoarding disorder.
In some cases, family members keep the living area from being cluttered, and in such
cases, the individual can still receive a diagnosis of hoarding disorder if sufficient dis-
tress or other impairment is generated by the behavior.


**158** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion D

People who hoard experience distress largely due to the consequences of the behav-
ior, such as conflict with family members over the clutter, and not due to the thoughts
or behaviors themselves. Research suggests that functioning is impaired in a variety
of domains. People are often unable to use living spaces in the home, and in severe
cases appliances are not functional and utilities such as water and electricity are shut
off. Hoarding poses a serious public health burden (e.g., fire hazards, infestations)
and increases costs to the public in the form of involvement by social service agencies.

Criterion E

Several other medical conditions can lead to clutter and difficulty discarding posses-
sions. For example, hoarding behaviors have occurred in people with lesions in the
anterior ventromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Also, many individuals with
Prader-Willi syndrome (a rare genetic disorder associated with short stature, hyper-
phagia, insatiability, and food-seeking behavior) display hoarding behavior, mostly
associated with food, but with nonfood items as well.

Criterion F

In some people, hoarding may be related to OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, or
major depressive disorder instead of being an independent disorder. These disorders
need to be ruled out. Hoarding behavior can also occur in individuals with severe de-
mentia; however, hoarding associated with dementia appears to stem from significant
cognitive deterioration rather than from excessive attachment to objects. Hoarding is
also described in institutionalized patients with schizophrenia, but the behavior does
not appear to be motivated by a true attachment to objects. OCD is the disorder most
closely associated with hoarding, and about approximately 20% of individuals with
OCD have hoarding symptoms. In some cases where the hoarding behavior appears
to be secondary to more classic OCD symptoms, such as contamination, the diagnosis
of hoarding disorder would not be appropriate.

Specifiers

DSM-5 includes the specifier “with excessive acquisition.” People with hoarding prob-
lems tend to buy and carry with them a large number of “just in case” items, and stud-
ies have confirmed excessive acquiring in the context of hoarding. Acquisition of free
things also tends to be excessive. Stealing is another form of excessive acquisition as-
sociated with hoarding. Although only a small percentage of people with hoarding
disorder steal, kleptomania is not uncommon (10%). The diagnostic criteria do not in-
clude excessive acquisition, because a small percentage (10%–15%) of people who
hoard report no excessive acquisition.
Insight specifiers similar to those for OCD are also available. When the disorder is
severe, the hoarding may appear to take on delusional proportions. Clinicians gener-
ally rate hoarding patients as having poor or limited insight compared with more typ-
ical individuals with OCD. Sometimes the term _insight_ is confused with _overvalued_


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **159**

_ideation,_ which refers to a belief maintained despite evidence to the contrary. In the
context of hoarding, overvalued ideation involves beliefs about the value or useful-
ness of possessions. Many individuals with hoarding recognize the problem with
their behavior, but their unreasonable ideas about the value of their possessions make
it impossible for them to discard. This may appear to an observer as a lack of insight,
but in reality these beliefs about the value and usefulness of possessions may repre-
sent part of the disorder.

Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)

Trichotillomania involves repetitive hair pulling leading to noticeable hair loss, sub-
jective distress, and social or occupational impairment. Research has shown that the
prevalence of trichotillomania among adults and adolescents in the United States
ranges from 1% to 2%. Trichotillomania was included in the DSM-IV chapter “Im-
pulse-Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified.”
The name has been modified in DSM-5 by including a more descriptive term— _hair-
pulling disorder_ —parenthetically. Given that research in clinical phenomenology, neurobi-
ology, and genetics has suggested an association between trichotillomania and OCD,
DSM-5 includes trichotillomania with the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Trichotillomania
(Hair-Pulling Disorder) **312.39 (F63.3)**

A. Recurrent pulling out of one’s hair, resulting in hair loss.
B. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling.
C. The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a
dermatological condition).
E. The hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder
(e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dys-
morphic disorder).

Criterion A

Hair pulling may occur in any body region. The most common sites are the scalp, eye-
brows, and eyelids; less common sites are axillary, facial, pubic, and perirectal regions.
Hair-pulling sites may vary over time, and hair pulling may occur in brief episodes scat-
tered throughout the day or in less frequent but more sustained periods. Criterion A re-
quires that hair pulling lead to hair loss, but unlike in DSM-IV, this criterion does not
require that the hair loss be “noticeable.” In fact, individuals with trichotillomania may
pull hair in a widely distributed pattern (i.e., pulling single hairs from all over a site) such
that hair loss may not be clearly visible. Alternatively, individuals may attempt to conceal
or camouflage hair loss (e.g., with makeup, scarves, or wigs).


**160** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion B

This item requires that individuals with trichotillomania attempt unsuccessfully to
control their pulling. This criterion reflects the intense drive underlying the behavior.
The criterion also more accurately represents what many individuals with the condi-
tion report (i.e., that they do not feel tension before pulling or experience relief or grat-
ification after pulling). This item replaces DSM-IV’s Criteria B (“sense of tension imme-
diately before pulling”) and C (“pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the
hair”) based on evidence that some individuals with trichotillomania did not have
these symptoms and thus their presentations did not qualify for the diagnosis.

Criterion C

Trichotillomania is associated with subjective distress as well as with social and occu-
pational impairment. The disorder causes significant embarrassment. People attempt
to avoid pulling in front of others and to avoid situations where the consequences of
pulling may be noticed (e.g., swimming, sexual intimacy). Individuals also attempt to
camouflage bald spots with wigs or scarfs. In addition, there may be irreversible dam-
age to hair growth and hair quality. Infrequent medical consequences of behavior in-
clude digit purpura, musculoskeletal injury (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome; back,
shoulder, and neck pain), blepharitis, and dental damage (e.g., worn or broken teeth
due to hair biting). Swallowing of hair (trichophagia) may lead to trichobezoars, with
subsequent anemia, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea and vomiting, bowel ob-
struction, and even perforation.

Criterion D

Trichotillomania is not diagnosed when the hair pulling or hair loss is due to another
medical condition (e.g., inflammation of the skin or other dermatological conditions).
Other causes of scarring alopecia (e.g., alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, telogen
effluvium) or nonscarring alopecia (e.g., chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen
planopilaris, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, pseudopelade, folliculitis decal-
vans, dissecting folliculitis, acne keloidalis) should be considered in individuals with
hair loss who deny hair pulling. Skin biopsy or dermoscopy can be used to differen-
tiate individuals with trichotillomania from those with dermatological disorders.

Criterion E

Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder may remove body hair they perceive as
ugly or abnormal. People with OCD may pull out hairs as part of their symmetry rit-
uals. Hair pulling may meet the definition of stereotyped behaviors (as in stereotypic
movement disorder), but the diagnostic criteria for stereotypic movement disorder
exclude symptoms better explained by trichotillomania. Individuals with a psychosis
may remove hair in response to delusions or hallucinations. Trichotillomania is not
diagnosed in such cases. Although hair-pulling symptoms may be exacerbated by
certain substances, such as stimulants, it is not clear that substances can be the pri-
mary cause of recurrent hair pulling.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **161**

Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder

Excoriation disorder is characterized by the recurrent, compulsive picking of skin, lead-
ing to skin lesions. Although long described in the medical literature, excoriation dis-
order is new to DSM-5, partly in response to the growing body of data emphasizing
its prevalence and potentially disabling nature. There are significant clinical similari-
ties between excoriation disorder and trichotillomania, and the criteria for the two dis-
orders are very similar. The criteria for excoriation disorder are supported by a field
survey.
Prevalence studies have found that excoriation disorder occurs in 1.4%–5.4% of
the general population. Often considered chronic, the disorder fluctuates in intensity
and severity. Few people with this disorder seek treatment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Excoriation (Skin-Picking)
Disorder **698.4 (L98.1)**

A. Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions.
B. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking.
C. The skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The skin picking is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g., scabies).
E. The skin picking is not better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder
(e.g., delusions or tactile hallucinations in a psychotic disorder, attempts to improve
a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder, stereotypies
in stereotypic movement disorder, or intention to harm oneself in nonsuicidal self-
injury).

Criterion A

All individuals at some time pick at their skin, either to smooth out irregularities or
to improve blemishes or acne. Criterion A requires that picking be recurrent and re-
sult in lesions, thereby reflecting the frequency and intensity of the picking. Although
the face is the most commonly reported site of picking, areas such as the hands, fingers,
torso, arms, and legs are also common targets. Individuals with excoriation disorder
report multiple sites of picking and the use of multiple instruments (e.g., fingernails,
knives, tweezers, pins). Picking may result in significant tissue damage and may lead
to medical complications such as localized infections and septicemia.

Criterion B

This criterion requires that the person has tried to decrease or stop the picking, reflect-
ing the intense drive underlying the behavior. Neurocognitive data support the idea
that individuals with this disorder have difficulty inhibiting motor behaviors once
the behaviors have begun.


**162** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion C

Individuals with excoriation disorder spend a significant amount of time picking
their skin, with many reporting that the behavior takes up several hours each day.
Because of the amount of time spent picking, individuals report missing or being
late for work, school, or social activities. The picking also leads to problems with self-
esteem and difficulties in personal relationships.

Criterion D

Use of stimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines can lead to skin picking
and should be ruled out. In addition, many dermatological conditions, including sca-
bies, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and blistering skin disorders, can lead to scratching
or picking.

Criterion E

Excoriation disorder is often misdiagnosed as either OCD or body dysmorphic disor-
der. The repetitive motor symptoms of excoriation disorder resemble compulsive rit-
uals, although individuals are less likely to report obsessive thoughts about their skin
and may even be unaware of their picking behavior because of its automatic nature.
Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder pick at their skin to improve their ap-
pearance.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder

It is important to consider whether any of the symptoms associated with OCD or re-
lated disorders are due to the direct effects of a substance, in which case the appropriate
diagnosis is substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, or substance/medication-
induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. A range of obsessive thoughts
and compulsive behaviors occur as part of substance intoxication or substance with-
drawal. If the obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors persist for a substantial pe-
riod of time after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication, and are in
excess of what is expected and warrant independent clinical attention, then the diag-
nosis of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is
appropriate.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder

A. Obsessions, compulsions, skin picking, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive
behaviors, or other symptoms characteristic of the obsessive-compulsive and re-
lated disorders predominate in the clinical picture.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **163**

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by an obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an indepen-
dent obsessive-compulsive and related disorder could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessa-
tion of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-in-
duced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent
non-substance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of substance intoxi-
cation or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in
the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medi-
cation]-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are indicated in the table
below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid
substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use
disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related dis-
order, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance]
use disorder” before the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
(e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and relat-
ed disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-
stance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character
is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe
[substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use dis-
order. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use
of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record
only the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.

for diagnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
**With onset during withdrawal:** If criteria are met for withdrawal from the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.
**With onset after medication use:** Symptoms may appear either at initiation of
medication or after a modification or change in use.

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

The initial evaluation of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders requires that the
clinician rule out medical conditions as a cause of the symptoms. If a medical condi-
tion is present, and the OCD or related disorder is determined to be the direct patho-
physiological consequence of the medical condition, then the person should be
diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition. When communicating or recording the diagnosis, the clinician should use
the name of the etiological medical condition. That said, although cases have been re-
ported in the literature of various medical conditions inducing obsessive-compulsive
behaviors, they are rare.

Diagnostic Criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive and
Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition **294.8 (F06.8)**

A. Obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance, hoarding, skin pick-
ing, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive behaviors, or other symptoms char-
acteristic of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder predominate in the clinical
picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical
condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**With obsessive-compulsive disorder–like symptoms:** If obsessive-compulsive
disorder–like symptoms predominate in the clinical presentation.
**With appearance preoccupations:** If preoccupation with perceived appearance
defects or flaws predominates in the clinical presentation.
**With hoarding symptoms:** If hoarding predominates in the clinical presentation.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **165**

```
With hair-pulling symptoms: If hair pulling predominates in the clinical presen-
tation.
With skin-picking symptoms: If skin picking predominates in the clinical presen-
tation.
```
**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the
mental disorder (e.g., 294.8 [F06.8] obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due
to cerebral infarction). The other medical condition should be coded and listed sepa-
rately immediately before the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to the
medical condition (e.g., 438.89 [I69.398] cerebral infarction; 294.8 [F06.8] obsessive-
compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction).

Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and

Related Disorder and Unspecified Obsessive-

Compulsive and Related Disorder

These are residual categories to use for individuals with symptoms of an obsessive-
compulsive or related disorder who have distress or impairment but whose symp-
toms do not meet criteria for a more specific disorder in the class. The category other
specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is used when the clinician
chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet full criteria.
The clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., body dysmorphic–like
disorder with actual flaws).
The category unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is used when
the clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met, or there is in-
sufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and
Related Disorder **300.3 (F42)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an obses-
sive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate
but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive
and related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any
specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. This is done by recording “other
specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder” followed by the specific reason
(e.g., “body-focused repetitive behavior disorder”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:


**166** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. **Body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws:** This is similar to body dys-
    morphic disorder except that the defects or flaws in physical appearance are clear-
    ly observable by others (i.e., they are more noticeable than “slight”). In such cases,
    the preoccupation with these flaws is clearly excessive and causes significant im-
    pairment or distress.
2. **Body dysmorphic–like disorder without repetitive behaviors:** Presentations
    that meet body dysmorphic disorder except that the individual has not performed
    repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the appearance concerns.
3. **Body-focused repetitive behavior disorder:** This is characterized by recurrent
    body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., nail biting, lip biting, cheek chewing) and
    repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviors. These symptoms cause clin-
    ically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
    areas of functioning and are not better explained by trichotillomania (hair-pulling
    disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, stereotypic movement disorder, or
    nonsuicidal self-injury.
4. **Obsessional jealousy:** This is characterized by nondelusional preoccupation with
    a partner’s perceived infidelity. The preoccupations may lead to repetitive behav-
    iors or mental acts in response to the infidelity concerns; they cause clinically sig-
    nificant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
    functioning; and they are not better explained by another mental disorder such as
    delusional disorder, jealous type, or paranoid personality disorder.
5. **Shubo-kyofu:** A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of
    Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5) that is similar to body dysmorphic disorder
    and is characterized by excessive fear of having a bodily deformity.
6. **Koro:** Related to dhat syndrome (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress”
    in the Appendix to DSM-5), an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the pe-
    nis (or the vulva and nipples in females) will recede into the body, possibly leading
    to death.
7. **Jikoshu-kyofu:** A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of
Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5) characterized by fear of having an offensive
body odor (also termed olfactory reference syndrome).

Unspecified Obsessive-Compulsive and
Related Disorder **300.3 (F42)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an obses-
sive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate
but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive
and related disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified obsessive-compulsive and re-
lated disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to spec-
ify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information
to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- This chapter is new and reflects the scientific understanding that a spectrum of
    disorders related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is sufficiently distinct
    from anxiety disorders that it should stand alone.
- Hoarding disorder and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder are new, both achiev-
    ing full disorder status because of data showing their high prevalence, associ-
    ated functional impairment, and familial relationship to OCD.
- Trichotillomania is now termed “trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)” and has
    been moved from the DSM-IV chapter “Impulse-Control Disorders Not Else-
    where Classified.” Body dysmorphic disorder has been moved from the DSM-
    IV “Somatoform Disorders” chapter. In each case, the Anxiety, Obsessive-Com-
    pulsive Spectrum, Posttraumatic, and Dissociative Disorders Work Group rec-
    ognized the putative etiological relationship with OCD.
- A “muscle dysmorphia” specifier for body dysmorphic disorder has been added
    in recognition of the growing literature on this distinction.
- The OCD criteria have been revised to emphasize that obsessions are often urg-
    es, not impulses, and that they are intrusive and unwanted rather than merely in-
    appropriate. The DSM-IV “with poor insight” specifier has been refined, and an
    analogous specifier has been added for body dysmorphic disorder.

## Trauma- and stressor-related disorders is a new diagnostic

class that brings together conditions previously listed in DSM-IV as anxiety disorders
(acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]); disorders that are usu-
ally first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence (reactive attachment disor-
der, the new disinhibited social engagement disorder); and adjustment disorders. All
disorders in this class, listed in Table 8–1, result from exposure to traumatic or stress-
ful situations or events explicitly recognized in the diagnostic criteria. In DSM-5, the
trauma- and stressor-related disorders are placed directly following the obsessive-
compulsive and related disorders and precede the dissociative disorders. The close
placement of these disorders is a reflection of the manual’s metastructure, whereby
the proximity of disorders denotes presumed etiological relationships. Many of the
symptoms of these disorders resemble those observed in individuals with obsessive-
compulsive disorder (i.e., uncontrolled thoughts and preoccupations), whereas disso-
ciative symptoms may occur in individuals with acute stress disorder, PTSD, or ad-
justment disorders.
The DSM-5 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum, Posttraumatic, and Disso-
ciative Disorders Work Group recommended creating a separate diagnostic class for
trauma- and stressor-related disorders because of research showing variations in the
clinical expression of psychological distress following exposure to traumatic or stress-
ful events (Andrews et al. 2009). Rather than a fear- or anxiety-based response, which

had been the justification for placing acute stress disorder and PTSD with the anxiety
disorders, the most prominent clinical features are anhedonic and dysphoric symp-
toms, anger and aggressive symptoms, or dissociative symptoms, thus calling for a
new and separate diagnostic class. Furthermore, it was thought logical to combine
these with the adjustment disorders, which also result from exposure to stressful events
and have a variable presentation. The childhood-onset reactive attachment disorder
and disinhibited social engagement disorder both result from social neglect, defined
as the absence of appropriate caregiving during childhood, and therefore fit well within
this new diagnostic class.
Important changes have been made to the DSM-5 criteria for the disorders. With
acute stress disorder, the traumatic event is now more explicitly specified as having
been experienced directly, witnessed, or experienced indirectly. DSM-IV’s Criterion
A2, regarding the person’s subjective reaction, has been eliminated. Based on evi-
dence that acute posttraumatic reactions vary considerably, and evidence that DSM-
IV’s emphasis on dissociative symptoms was overly restricting, the menu of symp-
toms has been expanded to 14 qualifying as intrusion, negative mood, dissociative,
avoidance, and/or arousal symptoms.
PTSD is no longer considered narrowly as a fear- and anxiety-based disorder, but
has been reconceptualized to include a wide spectrum of negative responses to trau-
matic experiences, including anhedonia-like and externalizing symptoms. The elimi-
nation of the requirement for a subjective negative response _at the time of_ the event is
one of the changes that led to removing PTSD from the anxiety disorders and placing
it in a class with other disorders that arise in response to traumatic or stressful events
that precede the emergence of symptoms. DSM-IV’s Criterion A2, which related to
the person’s subjective reaction to the event, has been deleted, as it was for acute
stress disorder. In addition, rather than three symptom clusters (reexperiencing,
avoidance/numbing, and arousal), there are now four clusters, because the avoid-
ance/numbing cluster has been split into two (described more fully in the section
“Posttraumatic Stress Disorder” later in this chapter). A “with dissociative symptoms”
subtype is new, having been added to acknowledge the fact that these symptoms are
frequent and constitute the presentation of a definable group of individuals with
PTSD. Also, a criteria set for PTSD in children 6 years and younger has been devel-
oped for use in preschool children, with a lowered diagnostic threshold. For that rea-
son, PTSD is now developmentally sensitive.


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **171**

In DSM-IV, reactive attachment disorder was a childhood diagnosis characterized
by aberrant social behaviors that resulted from what was described as “pathogenic
care” involving disregard for the child’s emotional and physical needs, in addition to
changes of primary caregiver that prevented the development of stable attachments.
There were two subtypes: _inhibited,_ in which the child showed little responsiveness to
others and no discriminated attachments, and _disinhibited,_ in which the child showed
no reticence with unfamiliar adults and a pattern of social boundary violations. In
DSM-5, these two subtypes are now distinct disorders: reactive attachment disorder
and disinhibited social engagement disorder.
These two disorders essentially result from social neglect and/or other situations
that limit a child’s opportunity to form selective attachments. Despite their etiological
similarities, they differ in important respects. Reactive attachment disorder resembles
internalizing disorders and overlaps modestly with depression, whereas disinhibited
social engagement disorder resembles externalizing disorders, particularly attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, with which it partially overlaps. Furthermore, the dis-
orders have distinctive relationships with attachment behaviors. Reactive attachment
disorder involves the lack of, or incompletely formed preferred attachments to, care-
giving adults. On the other hand, disinhibited social engagement disorder occurs in
children who lack attachments, children who have established attachments, and even
children with secure attachments. The two disorders also differ in their clinical corre-
lates, course, and response to intervention. For these reasons, the work group recom-
mended two separate diagnoses in DSM-5.
Last, the adjustment disorders are relatively unchanged from DSM-IV, apart from
their new placement in this chapter (Strain and Friedman 2011).

Reactive Attachment Disorder

Reactive attachment disorder has been refashioned from the broad DSM-IV conceptual-
ization and, as noted in the introduction above, is characterized by absent or underde-
veloped attachment between the child and caregivers. Because it is caused by grossly
inadequate parenting, the disorder may be associated with signs of severe neglect (e.g.,
malnutrition, poor hygiene) and may co-occur with developmental delays in language
acquisition and cognitive ability. The children show little responsiveness to others and
make scant effort to obtain comfort, support, nurturance, or protection from caregivers.
In addition, these children have episodes of negative emotions (e.g., irritability, sadness,
fearfulness) that are not easily explained. The diagnosis is not appropriate for children
developmentally unable to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must
have the cognitive capacity of at least a 9-month-old to receive the diagnosis.

Diagnostic Criteria for Reactive
Attachment Disorder **313.89 (F94.1)**

A. A consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward adult
caregivers, manifested by both of the following:


**172** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. The child rarely or minimally seeks comfort when distressed.
2. The child rarely or minimally responds to comfort when distressed.

B. A persistent social and emotional disturbance characterized by at least two of the
following:

1. Minimal social and emotional responsiveness to others.
2. Limited positive affect.
3. Episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness, or fearfulness that are evident
    even during nonthreatening interactions with adult caregivers.

C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced
by at least one of the following:

1. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emo-
    tional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met by caregiving adults.
2. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportunities to form stable
attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).
3. Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective at-
tachments (e.g., institutions with high child-to-caregiver ratios).

D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in
Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the lack of ade-
quate care in Criterion C).
E. The criteria are not met for autism spectrum disorder.
F. The disturbance is evident before age 5 years.
G. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months.

Specify if:
**Persistent:** The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.

Specify current severity:
Reactive attachment disorder is specified as **severe** when a child exhibits all symp-
toms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively high levels.

Criterion A

This criterion defines disturbed and inappropriate attachment behaviors observed in
the child toward adult caregivers. The child rarely or minimally seeks nurturance
from an attachment figure and rarely or minimally responds to comfort when dis-
tressed. Although some have suggested that social impairment or social communica-
tion is a core of this disorder, it is likely that the absence of a selective attachment
necessarily impairs social functioning, and that social behaviors improve markedly
once the child is in a more favorable environment, making attachment the core of the
disorder.

Criterion B

This criterion indicates that the diagnosis requires a persistent social and emotional
disturbance characterized by at least two of three behaviors: minimal social and emo-
tional responsiveness to others, limited positive affect, and episodes of unexplained


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **173**

irritability, sadness, or fearfulness even during nonthreatening interactions with care-
givers. Separating these behaviors from Criterion A restricts the diagnosis to those
children who have both of these features, which are highlighted in the DSM-5 criteria,
and the absence of an attachment figure, implied but not spelled out in DSM-IV (Cri-
terion A).

Criterion C

This criterion requires that “a pattern of extremes of insufficient care” be present, as
evidenced by at least one of three caregiver behaviors: disregard for a child’s needs
for comfort, stimulation, and affection; repeated changes of primary caregivers; and
rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective attach-
ments, such as institutions with a high child:caregiver ratio. From a practical point of
view, this criterion poses challenges for the clinician, because insufficient care is not
always disclosed and cannot always be clearly identified. Many young children can-
not describe their own experiences, and caregivers may be implicated in inadequate
care (and therefore have no reason to self-report). Yet, retaining Criterion C precludes
making the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder in children whose maltreat-
ment is unknown to the clinician. On the other hand, there are no case reports of
young children exhibiting reactive attachment disorder without at least a reasonable
inference of seriously inadequate caregiving. The revisions are intended to describe
in more detail what is known about the types of care that appear to predispose chil-
dren to reactive attachment disorder. The criteria remain less specific than desirable,
but this is a challenging area of investigation and data are limited.

Criterion D

This criterion is unchanged from DSM-IV. It is presumed that the pattern of extremes
of insufficient care described in Criterion C is responsible for the child’s aberrant be-
havior.

Criterion E

Because of symptom overlap, autism spectrum disorder needs to be ruled out. Aber-
rant social behaviors manifest in young children with reactive attachment disorder,
but they are also features of autism spectrum disorder. The two disorders can be dis-
tinguished on the basis of developmental histories of neglect, the presence of re-
stricted interests or ritualized behaviors, specific deficits in social communication,
and the presence of selective attachment behaviors. Although the work group ac-
knowledged that autism spectrum disorder and reactive attachment disorder could
be comorbid, the lack of data combined with the concern about mistaking the former
for the latter led them to recommend that the criterion be included.

Criteria F and G

The symptoms must be evident before age 5 years (Criterion F), as in DSM-IV. New
to DSM-5, however, is the requirement that the child has reached a developmental age


**174** DSM-5 Guidebook

of 9 months (Criterion G). This criterion has been added to ensure that an attachment
disorder is not diagnosed in children who are developmentally incapable of demon-
strating a focused attachment. Stranger wariness and separation protest, in addition
to selective comfort seeking or behavioral indicators of selective attachment, typically
emerge between ages 7 and 9 months.

Specifiers

The specifiers may be used to indicate chronicity (present for more than 12 months)
and current severity.

Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder

Disinhibited social engagement disorder is new in DSM-5, having been split off from
the DSM-IV reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood. The essential
feature of disinhibited social engagement disorder is a pattern of behavior that in-
volves inappropriate and overly familiar behavior with unfamiliar adults or relative
strangers, thus violating the social boundaries of the culture. The child must have the
cognitive capacity of at least a 9-month-old. The disorder is uncommon, even among
those who were severely neglected and subsequently placed in foster care or raised
in group facilities. Disinhibited social engagement disorder has been described from
the second year of life through adolescence. At very young ages, children are usually
reticent when interacting with strangers. Children with this disorder not only lack
such reticence but willingly engage with strangers and will even go off with unfamil-
iar adults. In preschool children, verbal and social intrusiveness are common, often
accompanied by attention-seeking behaviors. When the disorder persists into middle
childhood, verbal and physical overfamiliarity manifest, as well as inauthentic ex-
pression of emotions, and by adolescence indiscriminate behavior extends to peers.
Peer relationships tend to be superficial and characterized by conflict.
Like reactive attachment disorder, disinhibited social engagement disorder is as-
sociated with cognitive and language delays, stereotypies, and other signs of severe
neglect, including malnutrition and poor hygiene. Signs of the disorder may persist
even when the neglect is no longer present. Thus, disinhibited social engagement dis-
order may be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attachments or
whose attachment to their caregivers ranges from disturbed to secure.

Diagnostic Criteria for Disinhibited Social
Engagement Disorder **313.89 (F94.2)**

A. A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and interacts with unfa-
miliar adults and exhibits at least two of the following:

1. Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar
    adults.
2. Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (that is not consistent with culturally
sanctioned and with age-appropriate social boundaries).


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **175**

3. Diminished or absent checking back with adult caregiver after venturing away,
    even in unfamiliar settings.
4. Willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with minimal or no hesitation.

B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder) but include socially disinhibited behavior.
C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced
by at least one of the following:

1. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emo-
    tional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met by caregiving adults.
2. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportunities to form stable
attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).
3. Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective at-
tachments (e.g., institutions with high child-to-caregiver ratios).

D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in
Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the pathogenic
care in Criterion C).
E. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months.

Specify if:
**Persistent:** The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.

Specify current severity:
Disinhibited social engagement disorder is specified as **severe** when the child ex-
hibits all symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively
high levels.

Criterion A

This criterion focuses the disorder more on aberrant social behavior than on disordered
attachment behavior. The diagnosis requires that two or more of four examples of disin-
hibited behavior be present. These include reduced (or absent) reticence in approaching
and interacting with unfamiliar adults, overly familiar verbal or physical behavior, di-
minished or absent checking back with the caregiver, and willingness to go off with an
unfamiliar adult. These behaviors are aberrant in many cultures, where a child would
typically become upset in these situations. The items composing the criterion are empir-
ically derived from investigations of the construct.

Criterion B

This criterion is presumed necessary from several lines of evidence suggesting co-oc-
currence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) signs and the social im-
pulsivity that characterizes the indiscriminately social/disinhibited phenotype. For
that reason, it is important that the behavior not be explained as a result of the impul-
sivity typically seen in children with ADHD. It appears that one may have ADHD
with socially indiscriminate behavior and that one may have socially indiscriminate
behavior without ADHD, but there are often moderately strong correlations between
the two symptom profiles. Thus, rather than make ADHD a rule-out for disinhibited


**176** DSM-5 Guidebook

social engagement disorder, it seems more useful to direct attention to the distinct-
ness of the latter from ADHD.

Criterion C

Extremes of insufficient care must be present as evidenced by at least one of three
caregiver patterns: disregard for a child’s need for comfort, stimulation, and affection;
repeated changes of caregivers; and rearing in unusual settings that severely limit op-
portunities to form selective attachments, such as institutions with a high child:care-
giver ratio. Insufficient care is retained in Criterion C (as in DSM-IV for the disinhib-
ited type of reactive attachment disorder) for the important reason that children with
adequate caregiving but chromosome 7 deletion demonstrate behavior phenotypi-
cally similar to that of individuals with disinhibited social engagement disorder. In-
sufficient care is described exactly as in reactive attachment disorder because no evi-
dence suggests that certain types of pathogenic care are more or less likely to lead to
reactive attachment disorder or to disinhibited social engagement disorder.

Criterion D

This criterion is retained from DSM-IV for the same reason that it was retained in re-
active attachment disorder, described in the previous section: the presumption is that
the pathogenic care situation described in Criterion C is responsible for the child’s
disturbed behavior.

Criterion E

The requirement that the child has reached a developmental age of 9 months serves
the same purpose as Criterion G for reactive attachment disorder, as noted earlier.

Specifiers

The specifiers may be used to indicate chronicity (present for more than 12 months)
and current severity.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

PTSD was introduced in DSM-III, but in the past this syndrome was recognized as “shell
shock” or “war neurosis” because it was most commonly seen in wartime situations.
Many of its symptoms, such as intrusive thoughts and autonomic hyperarousal, were
also seen in victims of other traumatic events, including natural disasters. In DSM-I, the
disorder was recognized as “gross stress reaction,” considered one of several transient
situational personality disorders:

```
Under conditions of great or unusual stress, a normal personality may utilize established
patterns of reaction to deal with overwhelming fear. The patterns of such reactions differ
from those of neurosis or psychosis chiefly with respect to clinical history, reversibility
of reaction, and its transient character. When promptly and adequately treated, the con-
dition may clear rapidly. It is also possible that the condition may progress to one of the
```

**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **177**

```
neurotic reactions.... This diagnosis is justified only in situations in which the individual
has been exposed to severe physical demands or extreme emotional stress, such as in
combat or in civilian catastrophe (fire, earthquake, explosion, etc.). (p. 40)
```
PTSD is common in the general population and can occur at any age, even in young
children. In women the most frequent precipitating event is a physical assault, whereas
in men the event often involves a combat experience. PTSD generally begins soon af-
ter the event is experienced, but onset can be delayed. For many individuals, PTSD is
chronic, but symptoms can fluctuate and may worsen during stressful times.
The major etiological factor leading to PTSD is a traumatic event that involves ex-
posure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. The event is
typically outside the range of normal human experience. Business losses, marital con-
flicts, and the death of a loved one are _not_ stressors that cause PTSD. A person’s age,
history of psychiatric illness, level of social support, and proximity to the stressor are
all factors that affect the likelihood of developing PTSD.
The DSM-5 criteria depart from those in DSM-IV in several important respects
(Friedman et al. 2011). The stressor (Criterion A) is more explicitly described, and the sub-
jective reaction (Criterion A2 in DSM-IV) has been eliminated. Whereas DSM-IV had
three major symptom clusters corresponding to Criteria B, C, and D (reexperiencing,
avoidance/numbing, and arousal, respectively), DSM-5 has four because the avoid-
ance/numbing cluster has been split into two distinct clusters: persistent avoidance
and negative alterations in cognitions and mood. The latter includes new or reconcep-
tualized symptoms such as persistent and exaggerated negative expectations about
oneself, others, and the world itself; persistent distorted cognitions about the cause or
consequences of the event; and persistent negative emotional state. The final cluster,
arousal, now includes reckless or self-destructive behavior (Criterion E2), but is oth-
erwise unchanged. Diagnostic thresholds have been lowered for children, and a specific
preschool subtype is included.
The work group dropped DSM-IV Criterion A2, which required individuals to
have subjectively experienced fear, helplessness, or horror at the time of a traumatic
event. In the past, it was believed that PTSD required an intense emotional reaction
at the time of an adverse event, but not all people respond to traumatic events in the
same way. Clinical and research experience show that Criterion A2 was not useful in
predicting who would later exhibit symptoms of PTSD. Furthermore, the criterion
tended to exclude people for whom exposure to a traumatic event was an occupational
hazard for which they had been extensively trained, and who were just “doing their
job,” and therefore did not experience a horrific reaction at the time.
The work group has also added a new symptom cluster. The avoidance and numb-
ing symptoms have been separated, with numbing symptoms renamed as a fourth
cluster called “negative alterations in cognitions and mood” (Criterion D). The cluster
is defined as showing evidence of two or more of seven specified symptoms in per-
sons over age 6. The criteria reflect the anhedonic component of PTSD in which persons
with PTSD are unable to experience positive emotions of joy or love, or enjoyment of
pleasure, which can be devastating to marriages and relationships.
The subtype for children 6 years and younger was created to lower symptom thresh-
olds and eliminate some symptoms that are difficult to assess in preschool children.


**178** DSM-5 Guidebook

Research had shown that the prevalence of PTSD in children when using the DSM-IV
criteria was lower than expected (Scheeringa et al. 2011).
The “with dissociative symptoms” subtype was created because it has long been
known that people exposed to traumatic events can experience dissociation (15%–
30% of persons with PTSD), mainly depersonalization and derealization (Lanius et al.
2012). These people respond differently to treatment, and neuroimaging studies show
that those who dissociate have distinctive patterns of altered neurocircuitry. The body
of information justified creating a specific subtype to recognize this specific subset of
individuals with PTSD.

Diagnostic Criteria for
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder **309.81 (F43.10)**

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Note:** The following criteria apply to adults, adolescents, and children older than 6
years. For children 6 years and younger, see corresponding criteria below.

A. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one
(or more) of the following ways:

1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).
2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others.
3. Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member or close
friend. In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the
event(s) must have been violent or accidental.
4. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic
event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains; police officers repeat-
edly exposed to details of child abuse).
**Note:** Criterion A4 does not apply to exposure through electronic media, televi-
sion, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related.

B. Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the
traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred:

1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic
    event(s).
    **Note:** In children older than 6 years, repetitive play may occur in which themes
    or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed.
2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream
are related to the traumatic event(s).
**Note:** In children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable con-
tent.
3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as
if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a contin-
uum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of
present surroundings.)
**Note:** In children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play.


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **179**

4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external
    cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).
5. Marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or re-
    semble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).

C. Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning
after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by one or both of the following:

1. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about
    or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).
2. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversa-
tions, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts,
or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).

D. Negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s),
beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two
(or more) of the following:

1. Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically
    due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as head injury, alco-
    hol, or drugs).
2. Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about oneself, oth-
ers, or the world (e.g., “I am bad,” “No one can be trusted,” “The world is com-
pletely dangerous,” “My whole nervous system is permanently ruined”).
3. Persistent, distorted cognitions about the cause or consequences of the trau-
matic event(s) that lead the individual to blame himself/herself or others.
4. Persistent negative emotional state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame).
5. Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities.
6. Feelings of detachment or estrangement from others.
7. Persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g., inability to experience
happiness, satisfaction, or loving feelings).

E. Marked alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event(s),
beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two
(or more) of the following:

1. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation) typically ex-
    pressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects.
2. Reckless or self-destructive behavior.
3. Hypervigilance.
4. Exaggerated startle response.
5. Problems with concentration.
6. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep).

Specify whether:
**With dissociative symptoms:** The individual’s symptoms meet the criteria for
posttraumatic stress disorder, and in addition, in response to the stressor, the indi-
vidual experiences persistent or recurrent symptoms of either of the following:


**180** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. **Depersonalization:** Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached
    from, and as if one were an outside observer of, one’s mental processes or
    body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality
    of self or body or of time moving slowly).
2. **Derealization:** Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings
    (e.g., the world around the individual is experienced as unreal, dreamlike, dis-
    tant, or distorted).
**Note:** To use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must not be attributable to
the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts, behavior during alcohol in-
toxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).

Specify if:
**With delayed expression:** If the full diagnostic criteria are not met until at least 6
months after the event (although the onset and expression of some symptoms may
be immediate).

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder for Children 6 Years and Younger**

caregivers.
**Note:** Witnessing does not include events that are witnessed only in electronic
media, television, movies, or pictures.
3. Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a parent or caregiving figure.

B. Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the
traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred:

1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic
    event(s).
    **Note:** Spontaneous and intrusive memories may not necessarily appear dis-
    tressing and may be expressed as play reenactment.
2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream
are related to the traumatic event(s).
**Note:** It may not be possible to ascertain that the frightening content is related
to the traumatic event.
3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the child feels or acts as if the
traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a continuum,
with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of pres-
ent surroundings.) Such trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play.
4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external
cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).
5. Marked physiological reactions to reminders of the traumatic event(s).

C. One (or more) of the following symptoms, representing either persistent avoidance

**182** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion A

This criterion has been edited to remove ambiguities and tighten the definition of a
traumatic event. The criteria make clear that exposure involves actual or threatened
death, serious injury, or sexual violence (the latter replaced the phrase “threat to the
physical integrity of self or others”). The ways in which a person may be exposed are
more explicit than in DSM-IV as well, and include directly experiencing or witnessing
the event, or learning about an event that a close relative or friend experienced, al-
though in the latter cases the actual or threatened death must have been violent or
accidental. Learning that a relative has died from natural causes, for example, is not
qualifying exposure. Criterion A4 is new and requires that the experience be repeated
or that there be extreme exposure to aversive details for an event (such as that expe-
rienced by first responders). Although the DSM-IV language may well have included
such exposures, it became clear following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
that those involved in cleanup activities can develop symptoms (even though they
may not have witnessed the event). DSM-5 also makes clear, in a note, that media ex-
posure is an insufficient qualifier (e.g., reading about the event, or watching the event
on television).

Criteria B, C, D, and E

Instead of three major symptom clusters as in DSM-IV, there are now four: intrusion
symptoms (Criterion B), avoidance (Criterion C), negative alterations in cognitions
and mood associated with the event (Criterion D), and marked alteration in arousal
and reactivity (Criterion E). Reckless or self-destructive behavior (E2) has been added
as a possible alteration in arousal and reactivity.
The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. The individual may
have recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event (B1). The empha-
sis is on spontaneous or triggered recurrent memories of the event that usually in-
clude sensory, emotional, or physiological behavioral components. A common
reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams during which the event is replayed or
represented by related dangers (B2). Distressing dreams may contain themes that are
representative of or thematically related to the major threats involved in the traumatic
event (e.g., in the case of a motor vehicle accident survivor, the dreams may involve
crashing cars). There may be dissociative states during which components of the
event are relived and the person behaves as though reexperiencing the event. Disso-
ciative reactions (“flashbacks”) are typically brief but may cause great distress (B3).
The individual persistently avoids stimuli associated with the trauma (Criterion
C). An individual may refuse to discuss his or her traumatic experience, or may en-
gage in avoidance strategies to minimize awareness of emotional reactions, such as
avoiding watching news coverage of traumatic experiences, refusing to return to the
place where the trauma occurred, or avoiding interacting with others who shared the
same experience (C2).
The individual may have negative alteration in cognitions and mood associated
with the traumatic event—for example, being unable to recall important aspects of
the event (dissociative amnesia) (D1), or exaggerated negative beliefs about oneself


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **183**

(e.g., I’m a bad person.”) (D2). Some may experience a sustained negative emotional
state, including fear, horror, or anger (D4), or develop feelings of detachment or es-
trangement from others (D6), such as _depersonalization,_ a detached sense of oneself, or
_derealization,_ having a distorted view of one’s surroundings. Others may report an in-
ability to feel positive emotions such as happiness or joy (D7), symptoms sometimes
referred to as emotional or psychic numbing.
The person must have two or more symptoms of arousal, such as an exaggerated
startle response or problems with concentration. Some individuals experience irrita-
ble behavior and angry outbursts (E1). In response to research findings, this symptom
description has been expanded in DSM-5 to indicate that the behavior may occur with
little (or no) provocation and may involve verbal or physical aggression toward others
or objects. This helps to distinguish PTSD from other causes of aggression, such as an-
tisocial personality disorder.

Criterion F

The duration is more than 1 month. This is unchanged from DSM-IV (Criterion E) and
helps separate PTSD from acute stress disorder.

Criterion G

This criterion is unchanged from DSM-IV and requires that symptoms cause signifi-
cant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.

Criterion H

The “rule-out” criterion is new to DSM-5 and brings PTSD into conformity with other
disorders whereby substances of abuse, medications, and other medical conditions
are eliminated as the cause of the disturbance. An important condition to rule out is
a postconcussive syndrome, or traumatic brain injury, that is responsible for a variety
of symptoms that could be due to PTSD, such as difficulty concentrating, irritability
or anger, or sensitivity to light or noises. It is possible for an individual to have both
conditions.

Acute Stress Disorder

Acute stress disorder was introduced in DSM-IV to recognize that dissociative symp-
toms could occur immediately following a traumatic event and that this would pre-
dict the development of PTSD. In DSM-5, the symptoms have been collapsed into a
list of 14 possible symptoms (Criterion B), of which at least 9 must be present to indi-
cate a diagnosis, none mandatory. Dissociative symptoms are included, but they are
not required as they were in DSM-IV. Research has shown that acute stress reactions
are variable and that many people with intense and disabling reactions never experi-
ence dissociation (Bryant et al. 2011).
The clinical presentation of this disorder typically involves an anxiety response
with some form of reexperiencing or reactivity to the traumatic event. In some per-


**184** DSM-5 Guidebook

sons, a dissociative or detached presentation can predominate, although these indi-
viduals typically will also display strong emotional or physiological reactivity in
response to trauma reminders. In others, there can be a strong anger response in which
reactivity is characterized by irritable or even aggressive responses.

Diagnostic Criteria for Acute Stress Disorder **308.3 (F43.0)**

A. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation in one
(or more) of the following ways:

1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).
2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others.
3. Learning that the event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend.
**Note:** In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the
event(s) must have been violent or accidental.
4. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic
event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains, police officers repeat-
edly exposed to details of child abuse).
**Note:** This does not apply to exposure through electronic media, television,
movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related.

B. Presence of nine (or more) of the following symptoms from any of the five catego-
ries of intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal, beginning
or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred:
**Intrusion Symptoms**

1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic
    event(s). **Note:** In children, repetitive play may occur in which themes or as-
    pects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed.
2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream
are related to the event(s). **Note:** In children, there may be frightening dreams
without recognizable content.
3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as
if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a contin-
uum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of
present surroundings.) **Note:** In children, trauma-specific reenactment may oc-
cur in play.
4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress or marked physiological reactions
in response to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect
of the traumatic event(s).
**Negative Mood**
5. Persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g., inability to experience
happiness, satisfaction, or loving feelings).
**Dissociative Symptoms**
6. An altered sense of the reality of one’s surroundings or oneself (e.g., seeing
oneself from another’s perspective, being in a daze, time slowing).
7. Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **185**

```
due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as head injury, alco-
hol, or drugs).
Avoidance Symptoms
```
8. Efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely as-
    sociated with the traumatic event(s).
9. Efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations, activities,
    objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings
    about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).
**Arousal Symptoms**
10. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep, restless sleep).
11. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation), typically ex-
pressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects.
12. Hypervigilance.
13. Problems with concentration.
14. Exaggerated startle response.

C. Duration of the disturbance (symptoms in Criterion B) is 3 days to 1 month after trau-
ma exposure.
**Note:** Symptoms typically begin immediately after the trauma, but persistence for
at least 3 days and up to a month is needed to meet disorder criteria.

D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
medication or alcohol) or another medical condition (e.g., mild traumatic brain in-
jury) and is not better explained by brief psychotic disorder.

Criterion A

This criterion describes the range of exposure that may lead to the development of
symptoms and is identical to Criterion A for PTSD, described above. DSM-IV Crite-
rion A2 was deleted because it required that the person’s response involve “intense
fear, helplessness, or horror” and the criterion was thought by the work group to have
little clinical utility.

Criterion B

Nine or more of 14 items are required for the diagnosis, and they roughly correspond
to those described above that occur in PTSD (Criteria B, C, D, and E).

Criterion C

Instead of a minimum duration of 2 days as in DSM-IV (Criterion G), this item requires
that the full symptom picture be present for at least 3 days following a traumatic event
but no longer than 1 month following the event. The purpose of this criterion is to sep-
arate acute stress disorder from PTSD, which lasts more than 1 month.


**186** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion D

The symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment. The extreme level of
anxiety may interfere with sleep, energy levels, and capacity to attend to tasks. Avoid-
ance in acute stress disorder can result in generalized withdrawal from many situa-
tions perceived as potentially threatening, which can result in nonattendance at
medical appointments, avoidance of driving, and absenteeism from work.

Criterion E

The symptoms must not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or an-
other medical condition. When brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event,
symptoms of acute stress disorder may appear. It is important to recognize that what-
ever caused the head trauma may also constitute a psychologically traumatic event
and that postconcussive and acute stress disorder symptoms are not mutually exclu-
sive and may co-occur.

Adjustment Disorders

Adjustment disorders are conditions in which people develop symptoms of emo-
tional distress or behavioral symptoms in response to stressful events, or feel over-
whelmed by their circumstances, but the symptoms fail to meet criteria for a more
specific diagnosis such as acute stress disorder or PTSD. With adjustment disorders,
people can experience varied symptoms, ranging from depression, to anxiety, to im-
paired work ability. These “walking wounded” may have symptoms sufficiently se-
vere to require treatment or care.
Adjustment disorders were accorded a separate class beginning in DSM-III. Ear-
lier DSMs recognized that individuals could develop symptoms in response to “a dif-
ficult situation or to newly experienced environmental factors” (DSM-I, p. 41) in the
absence of serious personality difficulties, yet adjustment disorders were included in
the category “transient situational personality disorders.” Because adjustment disor-
ders develop in response to identifiable stressors, the work group thought it appro-
priate to place them in the diagnostic class trauma- and stressor-related disorders in
DSM-5.
It is important to understand that if the individual’s symptoms lead to a more spe-
cific disorder, such as major depressive disorder or panic disorder, that diagnosis
trumps adjustment disorder, even when a stressor appears central to the onset of the
disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Adjustment Disorders

A. The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifi-
able stressor(s) occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s).
B. These symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced by one or
both of the following:


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **187**

1. Marked distress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stress-
    or, taking into account the external context and the cultural factors that might
    influence symptom severity and presentation.
2. Significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

C. The stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another mental disor-
der and is not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting mental disorder.
D. The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement.
E. Once the stressor or its consequences have terminated, the symptoms do not per-
sist for more than an additional 6 months.

Specify whether:
**309.0 (F43.21) With depressed mood:** Low mood, tearfulness, or feelings of
hopelessness are predominant.
**309.24 (F43.22) With anxiety:** Nervousness, worry, jitteriness, or separation anx-
iety is predominant.
**309.28 (F43.23) With mixed anxiety and depressed mood:** A combination of de-
pression and anxiety is predominant.
**309.3 (F43.24) With disturbance of conduct:** Disturbance of conduct is predom-
inant.
**309.4 (F43.25) With mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct:** Both emo-
tional symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and a disturbance of conduct are pre-
dominant.
**309.9 (F43.20) Unspecified:** For maladaptive reactions that are not classifiable as
one of the specific subtypes of adjustment disorder.

Criterion A

There must be an identifiable stressor, and symptoms must begin within 3 months of
its onset. Symptoms can be emotional or behavioral (e.g., depression, anxiety, acting
out). The operative question in suspected cases of adjustment disorder is, “What is
the individual having trouble adjusting to?”

Criterion B

This criterion is important because it describes the significant impairment in func-
tioning or subjective distress that distinguishes adjustment disorder from normal re-
sponses that many persons experience in the face of a stressful situation or event.
Adjustment disorders now require distress and/or impairment, rather than either
distress or impairment as in DSM-IV.

Criteria C and D

The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting condition, such as ma-
jor depressive disorder, and a more specific mental disorder has been ruled out. For
example, if a person experiencing anxiety in response to a stressor has symptoms that
otherwise meet criteria for panic disorder, that disorder—and not adjustment disor-
der—is the appropriate diagnosis.


**188** DSM-5 Guidebook

The symptoms cannot represent normal bereavement, which is not considered a
mental disorder. That said, should a bereaved individual develop symptoms consis-
tent with major depressive episode, the correct diagnosis is major depressive disorder
because the so-called bereavement exclusion has been removed (see Chapter 5, “Mood
Disorders,” for a discussion of the bereavement exclusion).

Criterion E

Adjustment disorders are time-limited reactions that occur in response to stressors
and that resolve when the stressor or its consequences end; the symptoms do not per-
sist for more than an additional 6 months. If symptoms persist, the person most likely
has some other condition, such as generalized anxiety disorder.

Subtypes

Once an adjustment disorder is diagnosed, the clinician can specify a subtype, which
will differ depending on the person’s presenting symptoms. Adjustment disorders
are varied but in most cases involve either depressive or anxiety-related symptoms,
or a mixture of depression and anxiety. In some cases, the stressor may lead an indi-
vidual to act out or misbehave, justifying the subtype “with disturbance of conduct.”
For example, an adolescent may shoplift or steal, or an adult may engage in an extra-
marital affair or embezzle funds. Sometimes a person may experience a mixture of
emotions and behavior problems, leading to the subtype “with mixed disturbance of
emotions and conduct.”

Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related

Disorder and Unspecified Trauma- and

Stressor-Related Disorder

These are residual categories to use for individuals with symptoms of a trauma- or
stressor-related disorder who have distress or impairment but whose symptoms do
not meet criteria for a more specific disorder in the class. The category other specified
trauma- and stressor-related disorder is used when the clinician chooses to commu-
nicate the reason that the presentation does not meet the full criteria. The clinician is
encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., _ataque de nervios_ ).
The category unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder is used when the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met, or there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Trauma- and
Stressor-Related Disorder **309.89 (F43.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a trauma-
and stressor-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **189**

meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related disorders
diagnostic class. The other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that
the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific trauma- and stressor-related
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified trauma- and stressor-related disor-
der” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “persistent complex bereavement disorder”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Adjustment-like disorders with delayed onset of symptoms that occur more**
    **than 3 months after the stressor.**
2. **Adjustment-like disorders with prolonged duration of more than 6 months**
    **without prolonged duration of stressor.**
3. **Ataque de nervios:** See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appen-
    dix to DSM-5.
4. **Other cultural syndromes:** See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the
    Appendix to DSM-5.
5. **Persistent complex bereavement disorder:** This disorder is characterized by se-
    vere and persistent grief and mourning reactions (see Chapter 22, “Conditions for
    Further Study,” this volume).

Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related
Disorder **309.9 (F43.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a trauma-
and stressor-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related disor-
ders diagnostic class. The unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder category
is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the
criteria are not met for a specific trauma- and stressor-related disorder, and includes
presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diag-
nosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- This new chapter brings together conditions in which an identifiable traumatic
    event or stressor or insufficient parenting has induced the disorder.
- DSM-IV reactive attachment disorder has been split to create a reformulated re-
    active attachment disorder and the new disinhibited social engagement disorder.
    This change was made to recognize that some children exposed to a pattern of
    extremes of insufficient care develop emotionally withdrawn behavior, whereas
    others become indiscriminately social.


**190** DSM-5 Guidebook

- The stressor criterion (A) for acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress dis-
    order (PTSD) has been revised to be more explicit in describing the types of
    events that lead to these disorders. Also, PTSD is now defined by the develop-
    ment of symptoms in each of four clusters, rather than three clusters. The avoid-
    ance/numbing cluster has been split into an avoidance cluster and a negative
    alterations in cognitions and mood cluster. A developmentally sensitive criteria
    set for PTSD has been included for children 6 years and younger.
- Adjustment disorders are mostly unchanged but specifically exclude those ex-
    periencing normal bereavement.

**300.15 (F44.9)** Unspecified Dissociative Disorder

## Dissociative disorders retain an important role in DSM-5,

whose metastructure recognizes that dissociative symptoms are a feature of disorders
in other diagnostic classes in the manual. For that reason, the placement of dissocia-
tive disorders between the trauma- and stressor-related disorders and the somatic
symptom and related disorders is meant to reflect the close relationship among these
categories. Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder include dissocia-
tive symptoms, such as amnesia, flashbacks, and numbing. The somatic symptom
and related disorders also include syndromes involving interference with sensory and
motor function that are dissociative in nature, such as pseudoseizures and other pseu-
doneurological symptoms.
Dissociative states have a long and rich history, their hallmark being a disruption of
and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of conscience, memory, identity, emotion,
perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior. They were first formally
recognized in DSM-I as “dissociative reaction.” DSM-II included the diagnosis “hysteri-
cal neurosis, dissociative type” as one of two neuroses (the other was “hysterical neuro-
sis, conversion type”). According to DSM-II, “In the dissociative type, alterations may
occur in the patient’s state of consciousness or in his identity, to produce such symptoms
as amnesia, somnambulism, fugue, and multiple personality” (p. 40).
Dissociative disorders were accorded a separate class in DSM-III, which included
diagnostic criteria for the many forms of dissociation and depersonalization that had
been described, including multiple personality disorder (renamed “dissociative iden-
tity disorder” in DSM-IV).
Some believe that dissociative disorders are rare, but research suggests they are
relatively common, particularly in hospital and clinic settings (Foote et al. 2006; Sar et
al. 2007). Subclinical forms of dissociation are frequent in the general population and


**192** DSM-5 Guidebook

are not inherently maladaptive (e.g., daydreaming). Experiences of pathological pos-
session and other forms of identity disruption may be even more common in non-
Western cultures. They are frequently found in the aftermath of trauma, and many of the
symptoms are hidden or confusing to individuals, making careful diagnostic evalua-
tion important.
Dissociative disorders cause substantial distress and disability and can disrupt
every important area of psychological function. Symptoms can be experienced as un-
wanted intrusions into awareness and behavior with accompanying loss of continu-
ity in subjective experience, or as an inability to access information or control mental
functions that are normally readily amenable to access or control.
There are several important changes in the dissociative disorders in DSM-5 (Spie-
gel et al. 2011). First, _derealization_ —the feeling of estrangement or detachment from
one’s environment—has been merged with depersonalization in depersonalization/
derealization disorder. This replaces DSM-IV’s depersonalization disorder. The change
is an acknowledgment of the importance of these symptoms and recognizes that they
often co-occur. Research evidence shows that people with prominent derealization
alone do not differ in any important respect from those with depersonalization accom-
panied by derealization.
Next, dissociative fugue is now a specifier for dissociative amnesia rather than an
independent disorder, as in DSM-IV. The criteria for dissociative identity disorder
have been changed to indicate that disruption of identity and conscience may be re-
ported by the individual as well as observed by others, and that the accompanying
amnesia can be for everyday events and for important personal information, not just
for traumatic events.
The dissociative disorders are mutually exclusive and are presented hierarchi-
cally. When present, dissociative identity disorder takes precedence over dissociative
amnesia and depersonalization/derealization disorder. The categories other speci-
fied dissociative disorder and unspecified dissociative disorder can be used for dis-
sociative symptoms that do not meet more specific criteria. Table 9–1 lists the DSM-5
dissociative disorders.

Dissociative Identity Disorder

Described for centuries and first recognized in DSM-III as “multiple personality disor-
der,” dissociative identity disorder is defined in DSM-5 as requiring two or more fully
distinct personality states, which in some cultures may be described as an experience of


**_Dissociative Disorders_** **193**

possession. The disorder is reported to begin in childhood and has been attributed to
adaptation to overwhelming circumstances, such as physical or sexual abuse.
Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may first present with symptoms
of emotional and behavioral turmoil. Some may notice memory gaps and incidents of
out-of-character behavior. These symptoms result from different “alters,” or alternate
identities, controlling an individual’s behavior for varying lengths of time. Switches have
been observed with stressful situations, disputes among alters, and other psycholog-
ical conflicts.

Diagnostic Criteria for Dissociative
Identity Disorder **300.14 (F44.81)**

A. Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states,
which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The dis-
ruption in identity involves marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agen-
cy, accompanied by related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory,
perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symp-
toms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.
B. Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information,
and/or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.
C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious
practice.
**Note:** In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary playmates
or other fantasy play.
E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical con-
dition (e.g., complex partial seizures).

Criterion A

This criterion has been revised to be more specific with regard to how the disorder
disturbs the person’s functioning. The language was changed to acknowledge a
marked discontinuity in the sense of self and sense of agency. DSM-IV required two
or more distinct “identities or personality states,” but the distinction between “iden-
tities” and “personality states” was never clear, nor was it clear that switches had to
represent a break with the person’s usual thinking and behavior. These changes may
be observed by others or reported by the individual (in DSM-IV this was unstated).
The concept of _possession_ appears as well (it wasn’t specified in DSM-IV).

Criterion B

In DSM-IV Criterion C, memory gaps were described as involving “important personal
information.” More guidance is given to clinicians in DSM-5 with regard to memory
lapses, in that they are described as affecting recall of “everyday events, important per-


**194** DSM-5 Guidebook

sonal information, and/or traumatic events.” Clearly, with dissociative identity disorder,
memory gaps tend to occur when one or more of the alters take control of the person’s
executive function, and the individual reports “losing time.” The quality and extent of the
memory loss are not consistent with ordinary forgetting. For example, the person may re-
port that he or she is unable to recall the past 2 days despite having excellent recall of
events immediately preceding and following the period of amnesia.

Criterion C

This criterion, new to DSM-5, recognizes that dissociative identity disorder causes
clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning in important life domains.
Symptoms are consciously experienced and are often quite disturbing to the person,
reflecting an alter’s intrusion into the person’s conscious functioning. When this oc-
curs, the person’s sense of self is disrupted. The person’s sense of directing his or her
speech and actions may be lost, and voices may intrude into the conscious mind; strong
emotions and impulses may emerge suddenly. People may become depersonalized
observers of their actions, which they may feel powerless to stop. The person’s body
may suddenly feel very different—for example, like that of a small child or an individ-
ual of the opposite gender—and all of these alterations in sense of self and this loss of
personal agency may be accompanied by feelings that the person recognizes are “not
mine.” These changes can be highly distressing, and for many people these symp-
toms will adversely affect relationships, marriages, parenting function, and one’s oc-
cupational and professional life.

Criterion D

This criterion recognizes that cultural and religious practices that include or even cel-
ebrate dissociation must be excluded as explanations for the disorder. Some indigenous
societies believe in the concept of _spirit possession._ These beliefs are not uncommon in
the developing world and non-Western societies, but they may also be found in cer-
tain religious groups in the United States and elsewhere. In these situations, alters may
present as spirits, demons, animals, or mythical figures.

Criterion E

This criterion recognizes that substances of abuse or a medical condition could be as-
sociated with dissociation and therefore must be ruled out. For example, hallucinogens
and phencyclidine (PCP) can induce dissociative-like experiences. Brain tumors or
seizure disorders (e.g., complex partial seizures) have been known to cause dissocia-
tive states. These conditions must be ruled out as part of a medical evaluation.

Dissociative Amnesia

Dissociative amnesia is characterized by the inability to recall important autobiograph-
ical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is considered too exten-
sive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. With dissociative amnesia, the person is


**_Dissociative Disorders_** **195**

typically confused and perplexed and may not recall significant personal information or
even his or her own name. The amnesia typically develops suddenly and can last from
minutes to days, or even longer. Most cases last less than 1 week. In DSM-5, two primary
forms are listed: 1) _localized_ or _selective_ amnesia for specific event(s) and 2) _generalized_ am-
nesia for identity and life history. Although some individuals with amnesia notice that
they have “lost time” or that they have a gap in their memory, most people with disso-
ciative disorders are initially unaware of their amnesias.
A major change in DSM-5 is that dissociative fugue is now a specifier for dissocia-
tive amnesia, not a separate diagnosis as in DSM-IV. This change was prompted by
the fact that the disorder is uncommon, is rarely diagnosed, and typically occurs in
the context of an amnesic episode. The fugue usually involves sudden, unexpected
travel away from home or one’s workplace, and the associated amnesia is character-
ized by inability to recall one’s past and the assumption of a new identity that may be
partial or complete. Fugues can last for months and lead to a complicated pattern of
travel and identity formation.

Diagnostic Criteria for Dissociative Amnesia **300.12 (F44.0)**

A. An inability to recall important autobiographical information, usually of a traumatic
or stressful nature, that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.
**Note:** Dissociative amnesia most often consists of localized or selective amnesia
for a specific event or events; or generalized amnesia for identity and life history.
B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
alcohol or other drug of abuse, a medication) or a neurological or other medical
condition (e.g., partial complex seizures, transient global amnesia, sequelae of a
closed head injury/traumatic brain injury, other neurological condition).
D. The disturbance is not better explained by dissociative identity disorder, posttrau-
matic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, somatic symptom disorder, or major
or mild neurocognitive disorder.

**Coding note:** The code for dissociative amnesia without dissociative fugue is **300.12
(F44.0).** The code for dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue is **300.13 (F44.1).**

Specify if:
**300.13 (F44.1) With dissociative fugue:** Apparently purposeful travel or bewil-
dered wandering that is associated with amnesia for identity or for other important
autobiographical information.

Criterion A

Dissociative amnesia primarily affects the ability to recall personal information about
oneself, and it may be selective for specific events or more global. Unlike in DSM-IV, the
criterion now specifies two types of amnesia: localized or selective, and generalized.


**196** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion B

The diagnosis requires clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning.
With this disorder, the person may feel that he or she is “going crazy” or may have con-
cerns about self-identity.

Criteria C and D

Amnesia must be distinguished from the effect of a substance or a neurological or other
medical condition that can induce amnesia. For example, individuals may experience
blackouts during periods of heavy alcohol use, and people who experience seizures
may be amnesic for varying periods of time prior to or following a seizure. Major neu-
rocognitive disorders can cause amnesia, but in these disorders the amnestic symp-
toms generally do not occur in isolation, and other symptoms typical of a dementia,
such as behavioral disturbance, will be present.
Dissociative amnesia must be distinguished from other mental disorders. This is
important because amnesia may be seen in other disorders, such as somatic symptom
disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. For example, a person with dissociative
identity disorder may experience amnesia when an alter takes control.

Specifier

The specifier “with dissociative fugue” is used when the person unexpectedly travels
away from home or the workplace, or wanders bewilderedly, during an episode of
dissociative amnesia.

Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

Depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by clinically significant per-
sistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization and/or derealization. Transient
depersonalization and derealization symptoms are very common. Research shows
that these symptoms comprise four or five factors: numbing, unreality of self, unreal-
ity of others, temporal disintegration, and perceptual alterations. There is no evidence
of any distinction between individuals with predominantly depersonalization or de-
realization symptoms. The disorder rarely begins after age 40 years and can become
chronic, resulting in significant distress and disability.

Diagnostic Criteria for Depersonalization/
Derealization Disorder **300.6 (F48.1)**

A. The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, dereal-
ization, or both:

1. **Depersonalization:** Experiences of unreality, detachment, or being an outside
    observer with respect to one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions
    (e.g., perceptual alterations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emo-
    tional and/or physical numbing).


**_Dissociative Disorders_** **197**

2. **Derealization:** Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect to sur-
    roundings (e.g., individuals or objects are experienced as unreal, dreamlike,
    foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted).

B. During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality testing remains intact.
C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, medication) or another medical condition (e.g., seizures).
E. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as
schizophrenia, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, acute stress disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder, or another dissociative disorder.

Criteria A, B, and C

Criterion A requires the presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonali-
zation and/or derealization. _Depersonalization_ involves feeling detached from oneself or
one’s surroundings, as though one were an outside observer (e.g., a “dreamlike” state).
A person may feel cut off from his or her thoughts, emotions, or identity. Another may
feel like a robot or automaton. _Derealization_ produces a sense of unreality or detach-
ment with respect to one’s surroundings.
Criterion B recognizes that despite the strange thoughts and sensations the person
is experiencing, he or she is not psychotic or out of touch with reality. Intact reality
testing excludes the possibility of a psychotic disorder.
The diagnosis requires the presence of distress or impairment in functioning (Cri-
terion C). The symptoms may be highly distressing; the affectively flattened and ro-
botic demeanor seen in some individuals may be incongruent with the extreme
emotional pain they report. Impairment is often experienced in both interpersonal
and occupational domains, largely due to the sense of hypoemotionality. Others may
experience subjective difficulty in focusing and retaining information, and feel a gen-
eral sense of disconnectedness from life.

Criteria D and E

Depersonalization and derealization can result from the use of substances (e.g., mar-
ijuana, hallucinogens) or from a medical condition (Criterion D). Presentation after
age 40 years should suggest the possibility of an underlying medical condition, such
as a seizure disorder, brain tumor, or stroke. Complex partial seizures are known to
induce depersonalization and derealization, but they are uncommon.
Depersonalization/derealization disorder needs to be distinguished from other
mental disorders associated with these symptoms (Criterion E). Individuals with
schizophrenia may experience depersonalization and derealization symptoms, but
these occur in the context of hallucinations and delusions. Some persons with major
depressive disorder experience feelings of numbness or feel emotionally dead inside,
but these feelings occur only during a mood episode. People with panic disorder can
experience these symptoms, but the symptoms occur during panic attacks and are not


**198** DSM-5 Guidebook

chronic. Depersonalization/derealization symptoms may occur in other dissociative
disorders, but in that case the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder
is preempted.

Other Specified Dissociative Disorder and

Unspecified Dissociative Disorder

The other specified and unspecified dissociative disorder diagnoses replace DSM-
IV’s category dissociative disorder not otherwise specified but serve a similar func-
tion as a residual category for dissociative symptoms that do not fit within a more
specific category.
Other specified dissociative disorder is used when symptoms characteristic of a
dissociative disorder are present and cause distress or impairment but do not meet
the full criteria for a more specific disorder in the class. The category is used when the
clinician chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet full
criteria. The clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., chronic or re-
current syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms).
The category unspecified dissociative disorder is used when the individual’s symp-
toms do not meet full criteria for a more specific disorder that causes distress or im-
pairment, and the clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met,
or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Dissociative Disorder **300.15 (F44.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissocia-
tive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for any specific dissociative disorder. This is done by recording “other specified
dissociative disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “dissociative trance”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms:** This cat-
    egory includes identity disturbance associated with less-than-marked discontinui-
    ties in sense of self and agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of possession
    in an individual who reports no dissociative amnesia.
2. **Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion:** Indi-
    viduals who have been subjected to intense coercive persuasion (e.g., brainwashing,
    thought reform, indoctrination while captive, torture, long-term political imprison-
    ment, recruitment by sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with pro-
    longed changes in, or conscious questioning of, their identity.


**_Dissociative Disorders_** **199**

3. **Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events:** This category is for acute,
    transient conditions that typically last less than 1 month, and sometimes only a few
    hours or days. These conditions are characterized by constriction of conscious-
    ness; depersonalization; derealization; perceptual disturbances (e.g., time slow-
    ing, macropsia); micro-amnesias; transient stupor; and/or alterations in sensory-
    motor functioning (e.g., analgesia, paralysis).
4. **Dissociative trance:** This condition is characterized by an acute narrowing or
    complete loss of awareness of immediate surroundings that manifests as profound
    unresponsiveness or insensitivity to environmental stimuli. The unresponsiveness
    may be accompanied by minor stereotyped behaviors (e.g., finger movements) of
    which the individual is unaware and/or that he or she cannot control, as well as
    transient paralysis or loss of consciousness. The dissociative trance is not a nor-
    mal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.

Unspecified Dissociative Disorder **300.15 (F44.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissocia-
tive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation-
al, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria
for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific dissociative disorder, and
includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- The criteria for dissociative identity disorder have been changed to indicate that
    disruption of identity and conscience may be reported by the individual as well
    as observed, and that the accompanying amnesia can involve everyday events
    and important personal information, as well as traumatic events.
- Dissociative fugue is now a specifier for dissociative amnesia, rather than an
    independent disorder as in DSM-IV.
- Depersonalization/derealization disorder is new to DSM-5 and, by merging de-
    realization with depersonalization, acknowledges that these symptoms often
    co-occur.

**300.82 (F45.9)** Unspecified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder

## The somatic symptom and related disorders are unified by the

presence of physical symptoms and/or excessive concern regarding medical illnesses
or symptoms. The new diagnostic class name was recommended by the DSM-5 So-
matic Symptoms Disorders Work Group because it better reflects the content of the
category and creates less confusion regarding its member disorders than did the for-
mer term _somatoform disorders_.
The concept of unexplained physical complaints was recognized in early editions
of DSM. A broad category of psychoneurotic disorders in DSM-I included “conver-
sion reaction,” in which it was said that the “impulse causing anxiety is ‘converted’
into functional symptoms in organs or parts of the body.. .” (American Psychiatric
Association 1952, p. 32). DSM-II introduced the new category “hysterical neurosis,”
characterized as an “involuntary psychogenic loss of disorder of function... symbolic
of underlying conflicts” (American Psychiatric Association 1968, p. 39). Two subcate-
gories were specified: “hysterical neurosis, conversion type” and “hysterical neuro-
sis, dissociative type.” The former represented continuity with DSM-I’s conversion
reaction and the latter with DSM-I’s dissociative reaction. DSM-III introduced the
new class of _somatoform disorders,_ which included somatization disorder, a syndrome
of unexplained physical complaints, patterned after Briquet’s syndrome (Feighner et
al. 1972) and named after a 19th-century French psychiatrist. Other conditions in-

cluded conversion disorder, psychogenic pain disorder (renamed _somatoform pain dis-
order_ in DSM-III-R and _simplified to pain disorder_ in DSM-IV), hypochondriasis, and
atypical somatoform disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder (dysmorphophobia), un-
differentiated somatoform disorder, and the residual category somatoform disorder
not otherwise specified were added to the class in DSM-III-R. The class was mostly
unchanged in DSM-IV except that criteria for somatization disorder were simplified.
The chapter has been reformulated for DSM-5 and brings together disorders that
were spread among several DSM-IV chapters. Many were listed in DSM-IV in the “So-
matoform Disorders” chapter. In addition, factitious disorder was moved to this
chapter from its own chapter, and psychological factors affecting other medical con-
ditions was moved from “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention.”
On the other hand, body dysmorphic disorder was moved from “Somatoform Disor-
ders” to the new chapter “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders” (see Chap-
ter 7). The somatic symptom and related disorders are listed in Table 10–1.

Although disorders characterized by the presence of somatic symptoms or concerns
are common, nonpsychiatric physicians found the earlier DSM diagnoses confusing
and difficult to understand. DSM-IV’s somatoform disorder diagnoses overlapped,
and clinicians had trouble distinguishing one from another. For these reasons, the di-
agnoses were rarely used and were often ignored. As a case in point, the diagnosis of
somatization disorder was thought by many to be difficult to use because of the require-
ment for what seemed like arbitrary and lengthy symptom counts that changed with
each new DSM edition. The DSM-5 classification minimizes the overlap by reducing
the total number of disorders and their subcategories. Clinicians should find the re-
formulated chapter and the revised criteria more user friendly (Dimsdale and Creed
2009).
There are several important changes from the DSM-IV somatoform disorders.
First, somatic symptom disorder is a new diagnosis that replaces somatization disor-
der, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and undifferentiated somatoform disorder. Because
these disorders all shared the presence of somatic symptoms and similar cognitive
distortions, the work group decided there was little reason for separate diagnoses that
were rarely used. In reconceptualizing these disorders, the work group aimed to make
them more useful.


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **203**

A major criterion for several of these disorders was that symptoms were medically
unexplained. Because of the general unreliability of a clinician’s determination of
whether a symptom is medically based or not, and the fact that such a determination
only encourages “mind-body dualism,” medically unexplained symptoms are no
longer emphasized as core features. Furthermore, unexplained somatic symptoms
sometimes accompany other psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder,
schizophrenia) and some medical conditions, and therefore are often a poor basis for
distinguishing “functional” from genuine physical disorders.
Although many clinicians have had difficulty with the concept of somatoform dis-
orders in general, and patients have found the diagnoses unhelpful and stigmatizing,
these disorders remain important because they can cause considerable subjective dis-
tress and impair functioning. Many individuals with these disorders have repeated
surgeries, develop drug or alcohol use disorders, experience marital instability, and
attempt suicide. Co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders are common. The disor-
ders tend to be chronic, with fluctuations in frequency and severity of symptoms.
In DSM-5, instead of an emphasis on the absence of a medical explanation serving
as an organizing principle for the disorders, the focus is on distressing somatic symp-
toms and abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Basing a diagnosis on the _ab-
sence_ of a medical explanation for the symptoms was as unsatisfying to clinicians as it
was to patients. The work group concluded that incorporating affective, cognitive, and
behavioral components into the criteria improves the validity and clinical utility of the
criteria. Individuals formerly diagnosed with hypochondriasis will now be split be-
tween somatic symptom disorder—for those with somatic symptoms—and illness
anxiety disorder—a new diagnosis for those whose main problem is illness anxiety
that occurs primarily in the absence of somatic symptoms. Pain disorder has been
eliminated as a diagnosis because it was rarely used and was not useful. It was easily
misinterpreted as implying that the person’s pain was psychologically motivated and
“in the patient’s head.” In most cases, individuals had medical disorders that ex-
plained the pain, but it was clear that psychological factors contributed to the pain.
Conversion disorder has been renamed conversion disorder (functional neurolog-
ical symptom disorder) to acknowledge that neurological symptoms are the focus of
concern. The criteria emphasize the importance of the neurological examination and
recognize that relevant psychological factors may not be demonstrable at the time of
the diagnosis. Although the chapter has de-emphasized medically unexplained
symptoms, they remain key features of conversion disorder and pseudocyesis (listed
as an example of an other specified somatic symptom and related disorder). In each
case, medical evaluation can demonstrate that these disorders are inconsistent with
known mechanisms of pathophysiology.

Somatic Symptom Disorder

Somatic symptom disorder is a new omnibus category that replaces DSM-IV’s soma-
tization disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and undifferentiated somatoform
disorder. These diagnoses were rarely used and created confusion for both clinicians
and patients. The new diagnosis de-emphasizes medically unexplained symptoms,


**204** DSM-5 Guidebook

which had a central organizing role for many of the somatoform disorders. Instead,
the category is defined on the basis of distressing somatic symptoms, and the exces-
sive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that arise in response to these symptoms. The
work group felt that the DSM-IV criteria for somatization disorder were overly re-
strictive and that those for undifferentiated somatoform disorder and somatoform
disorder not otherwise specified had such low thresholds that either diagnosis could
apply to a large proportion of individuals seen in primary care. The new diagnosis is
expected to overcome these problems and will be more user friendly.
This new diagnosis follows in the long tradition of recognizing psychiatric disor-
ders whose primary manifestations are somatic symptoms or concerns. Somatic
symptom disorder will likely be used for individuals formerly diagnosed with soma-
tization disorder, hypochondriasis, or pain disorder. To diagnose DSM-IV’s somatiza-
tion disorder, the clinician followed a complicated algorithm that required the
presence of at least eight medically unexplained symptoms, including four pain, two
gastrointestinal, one sexual, and one pseudoneurological. The ensuing distress or
impairment had to be greater than would be expected from the history, physical ex-
amination, or laboratory findings. Many additional patients with fewer unexplained
symptoms were relegated to receiving a diagnosis of undifferentiated somatoform
disorder or somatoform disorder not otherwise specified.

Diagnostic Criteria for Somatic Symptom Disorder **300.82 (F45.1)**

A. One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disrup-
tion of daily life.
B. Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or as-
sociated health concerns as manifested by at least one of the following:

1. Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one’s symp-
    toms.
2. Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms.
3. Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns.

C. Although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the state of
being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months).

Specify if:
**With predominant pain** (previously pain disorder): This specifier is for individuals
whose somatic symptoms predominantly involve pain.

Specify if:
**Persistent:** A persistent course is characterized by severe symptoms, marked im-
pairment, and long duration (more than 6 months).
Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Only one of the symptoms specified in Criterion B is fulfilled.
**Moderate:** Two or more of the symptoms specified in Criterion B are fulfilled.
**Severe:** Two or more of the symptoms specified in Criterion B are fulfilled, plus
there are multiple somatic complaints (or one very severe somatic symptom).


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **205**

Criterion A

This item requires the presence of one or more somatic symptoms that are distressing
or result in significant disruption of daily life. The high bar set by DSM-IV with the
requirement for eight medically unexplained symptoms was confusing. This sim-
plified requirement should encompass the presentation of most of the individuals
whose symptoms formerly met criteria for somatization disorder, pain disorder, and
hypochondriasis.
Persons with somatic symptom disorder are excessively worried about their health,
see their bodily symptoms as unduly threatening, and fear the medical seriousness of
their symptoms. Health concerns often become an organizing principle for the indi-
vidual’s life, dominating all other concerns. Quality of life may be markedly impaired,
and the disorder can lead to a high level of medical care utilization.

Criterion B

Rather than focusing on the medically unexplained nature of symptoms (the empha-
sis since DSM-III), this criterion now requires the presence of excessive thoughts, feel-
ings, and behaviors related to these somatic symptoms or associated health concerns.
This criterion requires at least one of the following: disproportionate and persistent
thoughts about the seriousness of one’s symptoms, persistently high level of anxiety
about health or symptoms, or excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms
or health concerns.

Criterion C

This criterion requires the person to have been persistently symptomatic (typically
for more than 6 months), but not necessarily with any one symptom. Symptom mi-
gration, in which an individual previously preoccupied with a particular symptom
focuses on a new symptom, is not uncommon. For many individuals, preoccupation
with somatic concerns begins early in life and lasts years or decades.

Specifiers

The specifiers allow the clinician to identify individuals whose predominant symp-
tom is pain, as well as to rate the current severity of the condition as mild, moderate,
or severe. Typically, the disorder is more severe when multiple somatic symptoms are
present. The clinician can also specify whether the disorder ‘s course is persistent.

Illness Anxiety Disorder

Research suggests that about one-quarter of persons with hypochondriasis had few
somatic symptoms but were highly anxious and suspicious about the presence of a
serious but undiagnosed medical illness. Most of these patients’ presentations now fit
the new diagnosis illness anxiety disorder. Unlike hypochondriasis, wherein failure
to respond to reassurance is an explicit criterion, illness anxiety disorder has as its pri-


**206** DSM-5 Guidebook

mary focus preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious (and undiagnosed) med-
ical illness.
Although the individual’s concern may be derived from a nonpathological phys-
ical sign or sensation, the distress tends not to come from the physical complaint it-
self, but rather from his or her anxiety about its meaning, significance, or cause. If the
physical sign or symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological sensation, a be-
nign and self-limited dysfunction, or a bodily discomfort not generally considered in-
dicative of disease. If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the person’s anxiety
and preoccupation are clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the
condition. Individuals with this condition are easily alarmed about ill health and do
not respond to appropriate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic tests, or a be-
nign course. The clinician’s attempt to reassure the patient is frequently not helpful.
Incessant worry becomes frustrating to family members and may lead to considerable
strain within marriages and families.

Diagnostic Criteria for Illness Anxiety Disorder **300.7 (F45.21)**

A. Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness.
B. Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity. If an-
other medical condition is present or there is a high risk for developing a medical
condition (e.g., strong family history is present), the preoccupation is clearly exces-
sive or disproportionate.
C. There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is easily alarmed
about personal health status.
D. The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., repeatedly
checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits maladaptive avoidance (e.g.,
avoids doctor appointments and hospitals).
E. Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but the specific ill-
ness that is feared may change over that period of time.
F. The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another mental disorder,
such as somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body
dysmorphic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic
type.

Specify whether:
**Care-seeking type:** Medical care, including physician visits or undergoing tests
and procedures, is frequently used.
**Care-avoidant type:** Medical care is rarely used.

Criterion A

This criterion implies that somatic symptoms, if present, are relatively mild. This is
important because the essence of this disorder is not the presence of symptoms, but
rather the presence of health-related anxieties and preoccupations.


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **207**

Criterion B

This criterion is similar to DSM-IV’s Criterion A for hypochondriasis because both fo-
cus on the concern that one might have a serious illness. The operative word is _preoc-
cupation_ that is clearly excessive or disproportionate.

Criterion C

Although some people rarely think about health concerns, the person whose anxiety
and alarm satisfy this criterion is hypervigilant about his or her health. Such people
tend to monitor their bodies, enlarging the importance of each ache, pain, discolor-
ation, bowel change, or noise.

Criterion D

Like the person with obsessive-compulsive disorder, the person who fears for his or
her health engages in checking behaviors (e.g., to make sure there are no tumors or
swellings) or copes with these feelings through avoidance behaviors.

Criterion E

Preoccupation with the illness must last 6 months or longer, but the specific illness
feared may change over that period of time. In most cases, the clinician will note that
the preoccupation has been chronic for months or years.

Criterion F

Because some psychiatric disorders can be associated with excessive health concerns,
these other mental disorders and medical conditions must be ruled out as a cause of
the disturbance. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder will have other
symptoms (e.g., washing, counting, hoarding). Although individuals with panic dis-
order may have concerns about having a heart attack, this concern occurs in the con-
text of a panic attack.

Subtypes

The subtypes will enable the clinician to identify whether the individual is care seek-
ing or care avoidant.

Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological

Symptom Disorder)

Conversion disorders have a long history in psychiatry. Individuals with this disor-
der have symptoms that simulate or mimic neurological illness. Typical symptoms in-
clude paralysis, abnormal movements, inability to speak (aphonia), blindness, and
deafness. Pseudoseizures are also common and may occur in individuals with genu-
ine epileptic seizures. Individuals with conversion disorders are commonly seen on
neurology wards and on psychiatry consultation-liaison services at general hospitals.


**208** DSM-5 Guidebook

Conversion disorders were described in the nineteenth century by Charcot and
Freud and were considered a form of hysteria. Conversion reaction was included as a
diagnosis in DSM-I. The disorder was renamed hysterical neurosis, conversion type, in
DSM-II, which described it as “an involuntary psychogenic loss or disorder of func-
tion,” with such symptoms as “blindness, deafness, anosmia, anesthesias, paresthesias,
paralyses, ataxias, akinesias, and dyskinesias” (American Psychiatric Association 1968,
pp. 39–40). Criteria were enumerated in DSM-III, with minor wording changes in sub-
sequent editions.
For DSM-5, the name has been changed to include a parenthetical “functional neu-
rological symptom disorder” because the disorder is often seen by neurologists. In
addition, this term is more acceptable to patients. Importantly, DSM-IV Criterion B—
“Psychological factors are judged to be associated with the symptom or deficit be-
cause the initiation or exacerbation of the symptom or deficit is preceded by conflicts
or other stressors” (American Psychiatric Association 2000, p. 457)—has been deleted.
This criterion was always problematic because it was difficult to reliably assess and re-
quired considerable subjective judgment on the part of the clinician. The work group
proposed that the criterion be eliminated and that any discussion about a proposed
etiological factor be placed in the text. Additional concerns were that this DSM-IV cri-
terion was inconsistent with data showing that observed psychological factors are of-
ten nonspecific—that is, they occur in individuals with other conditions, often with a
similar frequency. Furthermore, in many cases psychological factors cannot be convinc-
ingly demonstrated.
Another change is the deletion of DSM-IV Criterion C: “The symptom or deficit is
not intentionally produced or feigned (as in Factitious Disorder or Malingering)”
(American Psychiatric Association 2000, p. 457). This criterion was always difficult for
clinicians to use because it is nearly impossible to know with any degree of confidence
whether or not a person is feigning. Also, there is little evidence that feigning is more
common in individuals with conversion disorder than in persons with other mental
disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Conversion Disorder
(Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)

A. One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function.
B. Clinical findings provide evidence of incompatibility between the symptom and rec-
ognized neurological or medical conditions.
C. The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder.
D. The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evalua-
tion.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for conversion disorder is **300.11,** which is as-
signed regardless of the symptom type. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the symp-
tom type (see below).


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **209**

Specify symptom type:
**(F44.4) With weakness or paralysis
(F44.4) With abnormal movement** (e.g., tremor, dystonic movement, myoclonus,
gait disorder)
**(F44.4) With swallowing symptoms
(F44.4) With speech symptom** (e.g., dysphonia, slurred speech)
**(F44.5) With attacks or seizures
(F44.6) With anesthesia or sensory loss
(F44.6) With special sensory symptom** (e.g., visual, olfactory, or hearing distur-
bance)
**(F44.7) With mixed symptoms**

Specify if:
**Acute episode:** Symptoms present for less than 6 months.
**Persistent:** Symptoms occurring for 6 months or more.

Specify if:
**With psychological stressor** (specify stressor)
**Without psychological stressor**

Criterion A

The essential feature of conversion disorder is the presence of symptoms or subjective
deficits affecting motor or sensory functioning, or apparent impairment in level of
consciousness. Motor symptoms include weakness or paralysis of a body part; abnor-
mal movements, such as tremor, jerky movements, and other hyper- or hypokinetic
movement abnormalities; gait abnormalities; and abnormal limb posturing. Sensory
symptoms include altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing. Epi-
sodes of abnormal generalized limb shaking with apparent impaired or loss of con-
sciousness may resemble epileptic seizures (pseudoseizures). The person may collapse
and be motionless and unresponsive in an episode resembling syncope or coma.
Other symptoms include reduced or absent speech volume, a sensation of a lump in the
throat, and diplopia.

Criterion B

Neurological disease must be excluded as a cause of the symptoms, and there must be
positive evidence of functional neurological symptoms. Positive evidence depends on the
demonstration of either internal inconsistency or incompatibility with disease. Internal
inconsistency means physical evidence of a symptom, such as weakness, that can be dem-
onstrated to be inconsistently present. For example, in Hoover’s sign, weakness of hip ex-
tension returns to normal strength with contralateral hip flexion against resistance.

Criterion C

Other recognized medical conditions and mental disorders must be ruled out. Re-
search shows that some individuals who receive a diagnosis of conversion disorder
are later found to have medical or neurological illnesses that, in retrospect, accounted


**210** DSM-5 Guidebook

for their symptoms. Clinicians need to keep this information in mind and to have a
healthy degree of skepticism. Conversion symptoms sometimes occur in individuals
with depressive or bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, and even schizophrenia. In
these situations, the symptoms are likely attributable to the primary disorder. The pos-
sibility of feigning, as part of either factitious disorder or malingering, should be con-
sidered in the differential diagnosis.

Criterion D

People with functional neurological symptoms may have substantial physical and
mental disability. The severity can be similar to that experienced by individuals with
comparable neurological disease. For example, the disability of individuals with
functional weakness is similar to that of individuals with multiple sclerosis of similar
duration, and the effect of pseudoseizures on social and occupational functioning is
similar to that experienced by people with epilepsy.

Specifiers

The clinician can choose to specify the patient’s predominant symptoms (e.g., “with
weakness or paralysis”), as well as course (acute episode or persistent), and whether
a psychological stressor is present or not.

Psychological Factors Affecting

Other Medical Conditions

The category currently called _psychological factors affecting other medical conditions_ has
a long history. DSM-I had detailed sections describing 10 _psychophysiologic auto-
nomic and visceral disorders_ (a term used in preference to _psychosomatic disorders_ ), each
involving a different organ system (e.g., skin, musculoskeletal, respiratory), in which
emotional factors were presumed to play a causative role. DSM-I stated, “These reac-
tions represent the visceral expression of affect which may be thereby largely pre-
vented from being conscious. These symptoms are due to a chronic and exaggerated
state of the normal physiological expression of emotion, with the feeling, or subjective
part, repressed. Such long continued visceral states may eventually lead to structural
changes” (p. 29).
The category continued in DSM-II mostly unchanged other than shortening the
term to _psychophysiologic disorder._ DSM-III revamped the concept to create a single cat-
egory called psychological factors affecting physical condition. The authors of DSM-
III noted that the diagnosis was rarely used and perpetuated the notion—since dis-
credited—that physical symptoms were caused by emotional factors. Also, the term
_psychophysiological_ was discarded because the decision about whether the condition
was psychophysiological or organic was arbitrary. The term was believed to decrease
collaboration between specialists and was thought to perpetuate simplistic ideas about
disease causation.
In DSM-III, psychological contributions to medical illness were integrated into the
new multiaxial system. The approach taken was that psychological factors may be as-


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **211**

sociated with the initiation or exacerbation of a physical disorder, which could be re-
corded on Axis III. However, “psychological factors affecting physical condition” was
considered a category, not a specific diagnosis. With DSM-IV, the authors chose to
move the category to the chapter “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical
Attention,” and it was no longer considered a mental disorder. To make the category
more useful, DSM-IV contained a subcategorization format that allowed clinicians to
specify the ways in which the psychological or behavioral factors could affect medical
conditions. For instance, the clinician could choose “personality traits or coping style
affecting.. .” and then specify the general medical condition involved. (For example,
a person could experience an exacerbation of his coronary artery disease because his
denial leads him to ignore warnings to minimize physical exertion.)
In DSM-5, this category has been moved to this chapter on somatic symptom and
related disorders to acknowledge the fact that somatic concerns are the main focus.
The criteria have had only minor wording changes. In DSM-IV, psychological factors af-
fecting medical condition had six subtypes. The subtypes were rarely used, however,
and have been eliminated.
Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions may be confused with
other DSM-5 categories that involve both psychological factors and medical symp-
toms. During differential diagnosis, the clinician should distinguish psychological
factors affecting other medical conditions from the somatic symptom disorders; for
example, with conversion disorder an individual may present with symptoms that
suggest a neurological condition and are related to psychological factors. Unlike in-
dividuals with psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, those with
somatic symptom disorders have no medical condition that adequately explains the
physical symptoms.
The essential feature of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is
the presence of one or more clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors
that adversely affect a medical condition by increasing the risk for suffering, death, or
disability. These factors can adversely affect the medical condition by influencing its
course or treatment, by constituting an additional health risk factor, or by exacerbat-
ing the physiology related to the medical condition. Psychological or behavioral fac-
tors include psychological distress, patterns of interpersonal interaction, coping
styles, and maladaptive help behaviors, such as denial of symptoms or poor adher-
ence to medical recommendations. Common examples are the person with anxiety
exacerbating his or her asthma, denial of the need for treatment of acute chest pain,
and manipulation of insulin by a person with diabetes wishing to lose weight. Cur-
rent severity can be indicated using a specifier.

Diagnostic Criteria for Psychological Factors Affecting
Other Medical Conditions **316 (F54)**

A. A medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is present.
B. Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition in one of
the following ways:


**212** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. The factors have influenced the course of the medical condition as shown by a
    close temporal association between the psychological factors and the develop-
    ment or exacerbation of, or delayed recovery from, the medical condition.
2. The factors interfere with the treatment of the medical condition (e.g., poor ad-
herence).
3. The factors constitute additional well-established health risks for the individual.
4. The factors influence the underlying pathophysiology, precipitating or exacer-
bating symptoms or necessitating medical attention.

C. The psychological and behavioral factors in Criterion B are not better explained by
another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder, major depressive disorder, posttrau-
matic stress disorder).

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Increases medical risk (e.g., inconsistent adherence with antihypertension
treatment).
**Moderate:** Aggravates underlying medical condition (e.g., anxiety aggravating
asthma).
**Severe:** Results in medical hospitalization or emergency room visit.
**Extreme:** Results in severe, life-threatening risk (e.g., ignoring heart attack
symptoms).

Criterion A

A medical symptom or condition other than a mental disorder must be present. As in
the past, this could involve a disorder from any organ system.

Criteria B and C

Criterion B has been edited but is otherwise unchanged. It lists the ways in which the
“psychological or behavioral factors” adversely affect the medical condition: this in-
cludes a clear-cut temporal relationship between these factors and the development
and exacerbation of, or recovery from, the medical condition. It is important to estab-
lish that the factors interfere with treatment, constitute a well-established health risk,
or influence the underlying physiology and pathophysiology to such an extent that
they precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or necessitate medical attention. Other men-
tal disorders need to be ruled out as a cause of the disturbance (Criterion C).

Specifiers

The clinician can indicate current severity indicators (mild, moderate, severe, or ex-
treme) that track to indicators of medical risk.

Factitious Disorder

Factitious disorder involves the intentional falsification of physical or psychological
signs or symptoms of illness, which in some cases leads the person to make hospital-


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **213**

ization a way of life. The term _Munchausen syndrome_ also has been used to describe
patients who move from hospital to hospital simulating various illnesses. Cases of
_Munchausen syndrome by proxy_ have also been observed. In this instance, a parent
induces (or simulates) illness in his or her child so that the child is repeatedly hospi-
talized. No reliable prevalence data are available, but factitious disorder is not un-
common.
Individuals are known to use various strategies to simulate illness. Some report
symptoms suggesting an illness without having them. Others produce false evidence
of an illness, such as a factitious fever produced by applying friction to a thermome-
ter, or intentionally produce symptoms of illness, such as by injecting feces to produce
infection. Factitious disorder is chronic and begins in early adulthood. Research evi-
dence suggests that many persons with factitious disorder worked in health care oc-
cupations, and many have severely maladaptive personality traits. The disorder can
severely impair social and occupational functioning.
The Somatic Symptoms Disorders Work Group recommended that factitious dis-
order be placed in the somatic symptom disorders chapter because physical symp-
toms are the main focus of concern. This placement should facilitate differential
diagnosis for individuals who present with persistent problems related to illness per-
ception, frequently including unexpected and/or unexplained psychological and/or
physical symptoms. This move may also facilitate research on the broad spectrum of
symptom-reporting phenomena, including the feigning of symptoms. The criteria
recognize factitious disorder imposed on self and factitious disorder imposed on an-
other (i.e., by proxy). The clinician can specify whether the disorder is a single episode
or is recurrent.

Diagnostic Criteria for Factitious Disorder **300.19 (F68.10)**

**Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self**

A. Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms, or induction of injury
or disease, associated with identified deception.
B. The individual presents himself or herself to others as ill, impaired, or injured.
C. The deceptive behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external re-
wards.
D. The behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as delusion-
al disorder or another psychotic disorder.

Specify:
**Single episode
Recurrent episodes** (two or more events of falsification of illness and/or induction of
injury)

**Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another
(Previously Factitious Disorder by Proxy)**

A. Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms, or induction of injury
or disease, in another, associated with identified deception.


**214** DSM-5 Guidebook

B. The individual presents another individual (victim) to others as ill, impaired, or in-
jured.
C. The deceptive behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external re-
wards.
D. The behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as delusion-
al disorder or another psychotic disorder.

**Note:** The perpetrator, not the victim, receives this diagnosis.

Specify:
**Single episode
Recurrent episodes** (two or more events of falsification of illness and/or induction
of injury)

Other Specified Somatic Symptom and Related

Disorder and Unspecified Somatic Symptom

and Related Disorder

Individuals whose somatic symptoms do not fit more specific diagnoses are diag-
nosed with other specified or unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder,
both of which replace DSM-IV’s somatoform disorder not otherwise specified.
The category other specified somatic symptom and related disorder is used when
the clinician chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet
full criteria. The clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., brief so-
matic symptom disorder).
The category unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder is used when the
individual does not meet full criteria for a more specific disorder that causes distress
or impairment and the clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not
met, or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Somatic Symptom and
Related Disorder **300.89 (F45.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a somatic
symptom and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the somatic symptom and related dis-
orders diagnostic class.
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Brief somatic symptom disorder:** Duration of symptoms is less than 6 months.
2. **Brief illness anxiety disorder:** Duration of symptoms is less than 6 months.
3. **Illness anxiety disorder without excessive health-related behaviors:** Criterion
    D for illness anxiety disorder is not met.


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **215**

4. **Pseudocyesis:** A false belief of being pregnant that is associated with objective
    signs and reported symptoms of pregnancy.

Unspecified Somatic Symptom and
Related Disorder **300.82 (F45.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a somatic
symptom and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the somatic symptom and related dis-
orders diagnostic class. The unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder cate-
gory should not be used unless there are decidedly unusual situations where there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

- Somatic symptom and related disorders is a reformulated diagnostic class that
    replaces the somatoform disorders. The key element is that all disorders focus
    on physical symptoms and/or excessive health-related concerns. The class em-
    phasizes affective, cognitive, and behavioral features of the disorders rather
    than focusing on physical symptoms.
- Somatic symptom disorder is a new diagnosis that replaces DSM-IV’s somati-
    zation disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and undifferentiated somato-
    form disorder. The DSM-IV diagnoses were not well used, were considered
    pejorative, and did not foster positive doctor-patient interactions.
- Illness anxiety disorder is new to DSM-5 and is used to describe a preoccupation
    with having or acquiring a serious illness.
- Body dysmorphic disorder has been moved to a new chapter, “Obsessive-Com-
    pulsive and Related Disorders,” based on research evidence showing its related-
    ness to obsessive-compulsive disorder.
- Factitious disorder and psychological factors affecting other medical conditions
    have been moved to this diagnostic class because of their central focus on phys-
    ical symptoms.

## The chapter on feeding and eating disorders has combined the feed-

ing disorders (pica, rumination disorder) from the DSM-IV chapter “Disorders Usu-
ally First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” with the eating disorders
(anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) to better reflect their shared phenomenology and
pathophysiology. The diagnosis avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces
and extends the DSM-IV diagnosis feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. In
addition, binge-eating disorder, previously included in DSM-IV’s Appendix B, has
now achieved full disorder status. Feeding and eating disorders reflect dysfunctional
appetitive drive and behavior and can span the entire age range. Table 11–1 lists the dis-
orders included in this chapter.
Disordered eating and eating-related behaviors have been recognized for centu-
ries. Richard Morton (1636–1698) is credited with making the first clinical description
of anorexia nervosa in 1689, but it was Sir William Gull (1816–1890) who coined the
term in the late nineteenth century. Gull’s patients were mostly emaciated young
women with amenorrhea, constipation, and an abnormally slow pulse who were none-
theless remarkably overactive. His account of the disorder remains noteworthy for its
attention to detail.
Despite Gull’s and other descriptions, eating and feeding disorders were not listed
in DSM until DSM-III, when they were included in the chapter “Disorders Usually First

Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.” Eating disorders were given their
own chapter in DSM-IV because it was clear that they could occur across the age
range. In revisiting the issue, the DSM-5 Eating Disorders Work Group recommended
that feeding disorders also be included in the same chapter with eating disorders be-
cause they, too, can occur across the age range.

Pica

The essential feature of pica is the eating of nonnutritive nonfood substances on a per-
sistent basis for a period of at least 1 month. Medical accounts that resemble the modern-
day definition of pica date back many centuries. Historically, pica has been consid-
ered either as an accompaniment to conditions such as pregnancy or developmental
disabilities or as a symptom of medical disorders such as iron deficiency. Children up
to age 24 months frequently mouth or even eat nonnutritive items, but this behavior
does not suggest that the child has pica. Although frequently associated with children
with developmental delays, pica is not confined to children or to individuals with in-
tellectual developmental disorders.
Pica has been regarded as an independent disorder since its inclusion in DSM-III.
The criteria were revised for DSM-5 to ensure that they can be used with individuals
of any age.

Diagnostic Criteria for Pica

A. Persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances over a period of at least 1
month.
B. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is inappropriate to the develop-
mental level of the individual.
C. The eating behavior is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice.
D. If the eating behavior occurs in the context of another mental disorder (e.g., intel-
lectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder], autism spectrum disorder,
schizophrenia) or medical condition (including pregnancy), it is sufficiently severe
to warrant additional clinical attention.


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **219**

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for pica is **307.52** and is used for children or adults.
The ICD-10-CM codes for pica are **(F98.3)** in children and **(F50.8)** in adults.

Specify if:
**In remission:** After full criteria for pica were previously met, the criteria have not
been met for a sustained period of time.

Criterion A

A single ingestion of a nonnutritive, nonfood substance is not sufficient to merit the
diagnosis of pica. The eating must be persistent over a 1-month period. Changes to
DSM-5 include the addition of the term _nonfood_ ; the wording “nonnutritive substances”
was potentially problematic because, with nonfood not specified, the term could in-
clude foodstuffs with no nutritional value, such as diet soda.

Criterion B

Mouthing of objects, including nonnutritive, nonfood substances, is developmentally
normal in young infants. A minimum age of 2 years is recommended because pica is
not an appropriate diagnosis for young children.

Criterion C

People around the world eat clay or dirt (called _geophagy_ ) for a variety of reasons.
Commonly, geophagy is a traditional cultural activity that takes place during preg-
nancy, for religious ceremonies, or as a remedy for disease, particularly in Central
Africa and the Southern United States. The indigenous Pomo of Northern California
also include dirt in their diet. Although it is a cultural practice, it may also fill a phys-
iological need (or perceived need) for nutrients.

Criterion D

Pica frequently occurs in individuals with developmental delays and sometimes in
pregnant women. Individuals with schizophrenia may have delusional beliefs about
the need to ingest nonfood substances. If the eating behavior is severe enough to war-
rant independent clinical attention, then the additional diagnosis of pica is appropri-
ate. DSM-5 has changed the wording from “during the course of” to “in the context
of” to retain consistency with parallel criteria for rumination disorder and avoidant/
restrictive food intake disorder, and because the example given (intellectual develop-
mental disorder) does not run a course.

Rumination Disorder

Rumination disorder is characterized by the repeated regurgitation of food. Included
in some form in the medical literature from the seventeenth century onward, rumina-
tion disorder occurs across the age range and in both genders. Individuals with this


**220** DSM-5 Guidebook

disorder repeatedly regurgitate swallowed or partially digested food, which may
then be rechewed and either reswallowed or expelled. Adolescents and adults may
be less likely to rechew regurgitated material. There is no involuntary retching, nau-
sea, heartburn, odors, or abdominal pains associated with the regurgitation, as there
is with typical vomiting. Although the disorder occurs more commonly in infants,
young children, and individuals with developmental disabilities, it also occurs in oth-
erwise healthy adolescents and adults. Unlike in typical vomiting, the regurgitation
is typically described as effortless and unforced.
DSM-III included rumination disorder of infancy as an independent disorder. The
criteria have been modified for DSM-5 to ensure that they are appropriate for individ-
uals of any age.

Diagnostic Criteria for Rumination Disorder **307.53 (F98.21)**

A. Repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least 1 month. Regurgitated food
may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out.
B. The repeated regurgitation is not attributable to an associated gastrointestinal or
other medical condition (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux, pyloric stenosis).
C. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder. 
D. If the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder (e.g., intellectual
disability [intellectual developmental disorder] or another neurodevelopmental dis-
order), they are sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention.

Specify if:
**In remission:** After full criteria for rumination disorder were previously met, the cri-
teria have not been met for a sustained period of time.

Criterion A

This criterion requires repeated regurgitation of food for at least 1 month. Not all in-
dividuals with rumination disorder, particularly older individuals and those with
normal intelligence, rechew the regurgitated food. Therefore, DSM-5 has deleted the
rechewing requirement and instead states, “Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re-
swallowed, or spit out.” In addition, the DSM-IV requirement that the behavior fol-
low “a period of normal functioning” has been deleted because this may be difficult
to determine.

Criterion B

Individuals with rumination disorder may have a history of reflux, and it may be dif-
ficult clinically to reliably parse out the medical and psychological components of the
behavior. In recognition of this clinical difficulty, DSM-5 requires ruling out an asso-
ciated gastrointestinal or other medical condition.


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **221**

Criterion C

Rumination behavior is well documented to occur in persons with conventional eat-
ing disorders. This criterion requires that the rumination be more than a symptom of
one of the eating disorders. If it occurs apart from the eating disorder, then it can be
independently diagnosed.

Criterion D

Rumination disorder commonly occurs in the context of developmental delays, often
as a means of self-stimulation. In these cases, this behavior is more appropriately con-
sidered a symptom of these other disorders or conditions. If the rumination behavior
is severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention, then the additional diag-
nosis of rumination disorder is appropriate. DSM-5 has changed the wording from “dur-
ing the course of” to “in the context of” to maintain consistency with parallel criteria
for pica and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and because the example given
(intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]) does not, strictly speak-
ing, run a course.

Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces and extends feeding disorder of
infancy or early childhood from DSM-IV. This disorder is a disturbance of eating or
feeding behavior that takes the form of avoiding or restricting food intake. The change
in the formal name of the disorder reflects the fact that there are a number of types of
presentation that occur across the age range rather than being restricted to infancy
and early childhood. Three main subtypes have been identified in the existing litera-
ture: individuals who do not eat enough or show little interest in feeding or eating;
individuals who accept only a limited diet in relation to sensory features; and indi-
viduals whose food refusal is related to aversive experience.
Avoidance or restriction associated with insufficient intake or lack of interest in
food usually develops in infancy or early childhood, although it can begin in adoles-
cence; onset in adulthood is rare. This disorder does not include developmentally
normal food avoidance, which is characterized by picky eating in childhood or re-
duced food intake associated with advanced age. Pregnant women may restrict in-
take or avoid certain foods because of altered sensory sensitivities, but this is a self-
limited behavior and the diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is not
warranted unless the eating disturbance is extreme and full criteria are met.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder appears equally common in males and
females in infancy and childhood. Various functional consequences are associated
with this disorder: impairments in physical development, relationship and social dif-
ficulties, caregiver stress, and problems in family functioning.
This diagnosis has been renamed from feeding disorder of infancy or early child-
hood in DSM-IV, a diagnosis that was rarely used. In revamping this category, the au-
thors of DSM-5 expect that the new category will be more useful. The category should
potentially fill a clinical need because a substantial number of individuals—not exclu-


**222** DSM-5 Guidebook

sively children and adolescents—restrict their food intake and develop significant
physiological and/or psychosocial problems, but their presentations fail to meet cri-
teria for an eating disorder. Avoidance/restrictive food intake disorder is a broad cat-
egory intended to capture this range of presentations.

Diagnostic Criteria for Avoidant/Restrictive
Food Intake Disorder **307.59 (F50.8)**

A. An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eating or food;
avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food; concern about aversive
consequences of eating) as manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate
nutritional and/or energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following:

1. Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering
    growth in children).
2. Significant nutritional deficiency.
3. Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements.
4. Marked interference with psychosocial functioning.

B. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or by an associat-
ed culturally sanctioned practice.
C. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia
nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way
in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced.
D. The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical condition or not
better explained by another mental disorder. When the eating disturbance occurs
in the context of another condition or disorder, the severity of the eating distur-
bance exceeds that routinely associated with the condition or disorder and war-
rants additional clinical attention.

Specify if:
**In remission:** After full criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder were
previously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time.

Criterion A

Many young children with avoidant/restrictive food intake difficulties had symptoms
that failed to meet DSM-IV criteria for feeding disorder because of the primary focus in
those criteria on failure to gain weight or weight loss, as well as the fact that certain fea-
tures of presentation are also commonly seen in older individuals. “Feeding distur-
bance” has been replaced by “an eating or feeding disturbance” to account for the
wider age range of people who have this disorder. Consequences resulting from food
avoidance or restriction may persist, and this criterion has been expanded beyond
weight loss or inability to gain weight. Faltering growth, nutritional deficiency, or de-
pendency on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, and marked interference


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **223**

with psychosocial functioning have been added because these are common clinically
significant consequences of such eating or feeding disturbances.

Criterion B

Because extreme poverty and cultural practices, such as religious fasting, can also re-
sult in significant weight loss, this criterion includes the phrase “not better explained
by lack of available food” and the requirement that there be no evidence that a “cul-
turally sanctioned” practice alone, such as particular religious or cultural observa-
tions, might account for the disorder.

Criterion C

Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements resulting in weight loss is a core
feature of anorexia nervosa and may be a compensatory behavior in bulimia nervosa.
For older children or young adolescents, these disorders share a number of features,
such as low weight and food avoidance. Anorexia nervosa, however, is associated
with fear of gaining weight and perceptual disturbances regarding one’s body weight
or shape. In the case of bulimia nervosa, the restriction or fasting is a compensatory
behavior for the recurrent episodes of binge eating. It is necessary to make a distinc-
tion between restricted food intake in the context of eating disorders, in which there
are weight or shape concerns, and restricted food intake in which such concerns are
not present.

Criterion D

Gastrointestinal (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux), endocrinological (e.g., diabetes), and
neurological (e.g., those related to oral/esophageal/pharyngeal structural or func-
tional problems) conditions can cause feeding disturbances and need to be distin-
guished from avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.

Anorexia Nervosa

Anorexia nervosa is characterized by persistent energy intake restriction, an intense
fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body self-perception. Anorexia nervosa was
the first eating disorder described and appears to have been present at different
points in history and to be present throughout different cultures. The disorder is as-
sociated with distorted self-image and other cognitive distortions regarding food and
eating. Individuals with anorexia nervosa sometimes engage in repeated weighing,
measuring, and assessing of their body in the mirror. The key clinical feature is de-
fined as a refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal level for
age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Anorexia nervosa is associ-
ated with high rates of morbidity (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, growth retardation, os-
teoporosis) and mortality.
Anorexia nervosa typically has an onset in adolescence and is more prevalent
among females. The disorder can affect men and women of any age, race or ethnicity,


**224** DSM-5 Guidebook

and socioeconomic background. The disorder has an estimated prevalence of 0.3%–
1% in women and 0.1% in men.
Anorexia nervosa was listed in DSM-I as an example of psychophysiological gas-
trointestinal reaction and in DSM-II as a feeding disturbance within the special symp-
toms category. It finally achieved full disorder status in DSM-III. The core diagnostic
criteria for anorexia nervosa are conceptually unchanged from DSM-IV, with one ex-
ception: _the requirement for amenorrhea has been eliminated_ (DSM-IV’s Criterion D).
Some individuals with anorexia nervosa may exhibit all other symptoms and signs of
the disorder and report at least some menstrual activity. In addition, this criterion
could not be applied to premenarcheal girls, women taking oral contraceptives, post-
menopausal women, or males. Because some data indicate that women who endorse
amenorrhea have poorer bone health than do women who fail to meet this criterion,
the information is clinically important even if not required for the diagnosis. In addi-
tion, the clinical characteristics and course for women with presentations that meet
all the DSM-IV criteria for anorexia nervosa except amenorrhea closely resemble the
characteristics of women with presentations that meet all of the criteria.

Diagnostic Criteria for Anorexia Nervosa

A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly
low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical
health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally
normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.
B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that inter-
feres with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.
C. Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced, undue
influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recogni-
tion of the seriousness of the current low body weight.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for anorexia nervosa is **307.1,** which is assigned
regardless of the subtype. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the subtype (see below).

Specify whether:
**(F50.01) Restricting type:** During the last 3 months, the individual has not engaged in re-
current episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the mis-
use of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). This subtype describes presentations in which
weight loss is accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise.
( **F50.02) Binge-eating/purging type:** During the last 3 months, the individual has
engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced
vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).
Specify if:
**In partial remission:** After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met,
Criterion A (low body weight) has not been met for a sustained period, but either
Criterion B (intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat or behavior that inter-
feres with weight gain) or Criterion C (disturbances in self-perception of weight and
shape) is still met.
**In full remission:** After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met, none
of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **225**

Specify current severity:
The minimum level of severity is based, for adults, on current body mass index (BMI)
(see below) or, for children and adolescents, on BMI percentile. The ranges below are
derived from World Health Organization categories for thinness in adults; for children
and adolescents, corresponding BMI percentiles should be used. The level of severity
may be increased to reflect clinical symptoms, the degree of functional disability, and
the need for supervision.
**Mild:** BMI ≥ 17 kg/m^2
**Moderate:** BMI 16–16.99 kg/m^2
**Severe:** BMI 15–15.99 kg/m^2
**Extreme:** BMI < 15 kg/m^2

Criterion A

The DSM-IV wording “Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally nor-
mal weight for age and height” has been changed to emphasize the importance of en-
ergy homeostasis for maintenance of a minimally normal weight. This change allows
for applicability of the diagnosis to individuals who employ increased activity as a
means of reducing weight.

Criterion B

DSM-IV required “fear of weight gain.” A significant minority of individuals with an-
orexia nervosa, however, explicitly deny experiencing such fear. Therefore, DSM-5
has added a clause to focus on behavior, “persistent behavior that interferes with
weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.”

Criterion C

The wording of this item has changed from “denial of the seriousness of the current
low body weight” in DSM-IV to “persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of
the current low body weight.” The word _denial_ was removed because of the lack of
empirical evidence supporting its use and the concern that it conveyed a paternalistic
and pejorative attitude.

Subtypes and Specifiers

In DSM-5, the subtypes restricting and binge-eating/purging are specified for the
last 3 months. Although data suggest that subtyping is useful clinically and for re-
search purposes, there is significant crossover between subtypes, and clinicians had
difficulty specifying the subtype for the “current episode” of illness (the DSM-IV
standard).
Clinicians can also specify whether the person’s disorder is in full remission or in
partial remission. The distinction is that with partial remission, in which low body
weight (Criterion A) is no longer an issue, the person still has an intense fear of gain-
ing weight or of being fat, or has a disturbed body image.


**226** DSM-5 Guidebook

Current severity can be indicated by specifying whether the disorder is mild, mod-
erate, severe, or extreme, based on body mass index.

Bulimia Nervosa

Bulimia nervosa is characterized by episodes of bingeing on food (i.e., consuming a
large amount of food in a short amount of time), followed by attempts to purge the
body of the food via vomiting, laxatives, or excessive exercise. The behavior is per-
formed in the context of overconcern with weight and shape. Russell (1979) observed
that both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are developmental disorders that
share the characteristics fear of fatness and body image distortion. As with anorexia
nervosa, there are medical consequences of bulimia nervosa, including loss of electro-
lytes, erosion of tooth enamel (due to repeated exposure to acidic gastric contents),
cavities, stomach ulcers, stomach or esophagus ruptures, constipation, irregular
heartbeat, and an increased tendency toward suicidal behavior. Bulimia nervosa also
exhibits marked differences from anorexia nervosa. Individuals with bulimia nervosa
tend to develop eating disorder symptoms later in life, generally lose less weight, and
have a tendency to be more extroverted and impulsive than persons with anorexia
nervosa.
This disorder, simply called “bulimia,” was included in DSM-III. The name was
changed to bulimia nervosa in DSM-III-R. Approximately 90% of people diagnosed with
bulimia nervosa are women, and its prevalence is estimated at 1.0%–1.5% in young
women.
The only change in the criteria is a reduction in the required minimum average
frequency of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behavior (Criterion C).
Clinicians can now rate severity levels that range from mild to extreme depending on
the number of episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week.
Although DSM-IV required that subtype (purging or nonpurging) be specified, a
literature review indicated that individuals with the nonpurging subtype closely re-
sembled individuals with binge-eating disorder. In addition, precisely how to define
nonpurging inappropriate behaviors (e.g., fasting or excessive exercise) was unclear.
For these reasons, DSM-5 has eliminated the purging and nonpurging subtypes for
bulimia nervosa. Instead, clinicians can specify whether the disorder is in partial or
full remission and the current severity (mild, moderate, severe, extreme).

Diagnostic Criteria for Bulimia Nervosa **307.51 (F50.2)**

A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by
both of the following:

1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount
    of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar
    period of time under similar circumstances.
2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one
    cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **227**

B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain,
such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications;
fasting; or excessive exercise.
C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on aver-
age, at least once a week for 3 months.
D. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.
E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.

Specify if:
**In partial remission:** After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met,
some, but not all, of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.
**In full remission:** After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met, none
of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.

Specify current severity:
The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of inappropriate compensa-
tory behaviors (see below). The level of severity may be increased to reflect other
symptoms and the degree of functional disability.
**Mild:** An average of 1–3 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per
week.
**Moderate:** An average of 4–7 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors
per week.
**Severe:** An average of 8–13 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors
per week.
**Extreme:** An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate compensatory be-
haviors per week.

Criterion A

Many people may experience an isolated episode of overeating, such as at a party
with unlimited free food. Bulimia nervosa is an appropriate diagnosis in cases in
which there are recurrent episodes of binge eating that occur during a discrete period
of time and involve the consumption of a large amount of food, and the person re-
ports feeling a lack of control.

Criterion B

The bulimia nervosa diagnosis requires that the binge eating be accompanied by re-
current inappropriate compensatory behaviors intended to counteract the effects of
the binge episode and prevent weight gain (e.g., vomiting, laxative abuse, diuretic
abuse, excessive exercise).

Criterion C

Although DSM-IV required that episodes of binge eating and inappropriate compen-
satory behaviors both occur, on average, twice per week over a 3-month period, re-
search found that the clinical characteristics of individuals reporting bingeing and
purging once per week were similar to those of individuals whose behavior met the


**228** DSM-5 Guidebook

DSM-IV twice-per-week criterion. DSM-5 therefore requires that the binge eating and
inappropriate compensatory behaviors occur at least once a week for 3 months.

Criterion D

Individuals with bulimia nervosa are preoccupied with body shape and weight. They
may report low self-esteem due to body image issues.

Criterion E

Individuals with anorexia nervosa may have a presentation that falls under the sub-
type referred to as _binge-eating/purging type,_ which must be differentiated from buli-
mia nervosa. The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa requires a refusal to maintain normal
body weight. When that requirement is met, the appropriate diagnosis is anorexia
nervosa.

Binge-Eating Disorder

Binge-eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating without
the recurrent use of compensatory behaviors. It was listed in Appendix B (“Criteria
Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study”) in DSM-IV, and the DSM-5 Eating Disor-
ders Work Group recommended that it achieve full disorder status. Binge-eating dis-
order is the most frequent eating disorder in the United States (1.6% of women, 0.8%
of men) and is more prevalent among those seeking weight loss treatment than in the
general population.
The distinction between binge-eating disorder and bulimia nervosa is sometimes
unclear, and the two categories may represent different stages of the same underlying
disorder. Compared with individuals with bulimia nervosa, people with binge-eating
disorder are generally older, are more likely to be male, and have a later age at onset
of the disorder.
Approximately two-thirds of individuals with binge-eating disorder have a history
of using inappropriate compensatory behaviors, suggesting a past diagnosis of bulimia
nervosa. Although weight and shape concerns are not required for the diagnosis, they
are commonly part of the presentation.
Clinicians can rate current severity based on number of binge-eating episodes per
week (although the level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms and
the degree of functional disability). Clinicians can also specify whether the disorder
is in partial or full remission.

Diagnostic Criteria for Binge-Eating Disorder **307.51 (F50.8)**

A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized
by both of the following:

1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **229**

```
of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat in a similar pe-
riod of time under similar circumstances.
```
2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one
    cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).

B. The binge-eating episodes are associated with three (or more) of the following:

1. Eating much more rapidly than normal.
2. Eating until feeling uncomfortably full.
3. Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry.
4. Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating.
5. Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward.

C. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present.
D. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.
E. The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compen-
satory behavior as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the
course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.
Specify if:
**In partial remission:** After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously
met, binge eating occurs at an average frequency of less than one episode per
week for a sustained period of time.
**In full remission:** After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.

Specify current severity:
The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of episodes of binge eating
(see below). The level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms and the
degree of functional disability.
**Mild:** 1–3 binge-eating episodes per week.
**Moderate:** 4–7 binge-eating episodes per week.
**Severe:** 8–13 binge-eating episodes per week.
**Extreme:** 14 or more binge-eating episodes per week.

Criterion A

The requirement of binge eating mirrors that for bulimia nervosa. The criterion re-
quires “recurrent episodes” to differentiate this disorder from context-specific in-
stances where an individual may binge on food, such as at a wedding or banquet.

Criterion B

Criterion B requires at least three of five indicators of impaired control: eating much
more rapidly than usual; eating until feeling uncomfortably full; eating large amounts
of food when not hungry; eating alone because of embarrassment; and feeling disgust,
depression, or guilt after the episode. The best overall indicators for correctly identify-
ing binge eating are “eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hun-
gry” and “eating alone because of feeling embarrassed.” Among men the most
common feature of binge eating is eating more rapidly than usual, whereas among


**230** DSM-5 Guidebook

women the most common feature is feeling disgusted, depressed, or very guilty after-
ward. Research indicates that the requirement for three or more symptoms yields the
most accurate prediction of binge eating while minimizing the false positives.

Criterion C

This criterion speaks to the specificity of distress associated with the binge eating.
Distress related to co-occurring disorders would not meet this criterion.

Criterion D

Analyses based on once-weekly and twice-weekly classifications were remarkably
similar. In DSM-IV Appendix B, it was suggested that the frequency of binge days, as
opposed to binge episodes, be assessed, and that a minimum average frequency of
twice per week over 6 months be required. Research indicates that criteria identical to
those for bulimia nervosa would not change caseness significantly. Therefore, Crite-
rion D was changed to be similar to Criterion C for bulimia nervosa, requiring at least
once a week for 3 months.

Criterion E

Binge-eating disorder is characterized by the absence of recurrent use of inappropri-
ate compensatory mechanisms after eating large amounts of food.

Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder

and Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder

Other specified and unspecified feeding or eating disorder should be considered as
diagnoses when the individual has symptoms of a feeding and eating disorder that
are distressing and cause impairment but do not meet the full criteria for a more spe-
cific disorder in the class.
The categories replace DSM-IV’s eating disorder not otherwise specified. The cat-
egory other specified feeding or eating disorder is used when the clinician chooses to
communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet full criteria. The clinician
is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., atypical anorexia nervosa).
The category unspecified feeding or eating disorder is used when the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met, or there is insufficient infor-
mation to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Feeding or
Eating Disorder **307.59 (F50.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a feeding
and eating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **231**

occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class.
The other specified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does
not meet the criteria for any specific feeding and eating disorder. This is done by re-
cording “other specified feeding or eating disorder” followed by the specific reason
(e.g., “bulimia nervosa of low frequency”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Atypical anorexia nervosa:** All of the criteria for anorexia nervosa are met, except
    that despite significant weight loss, the individual’s weight is within or above the
    normal range.
2. **Bulimia nervosa (of low frequency and/or limited duration):** All of the criteria
    for bulimia nervosa are met, except that the binge eating and inappropriate com-
    pensatory behaviors occur, on average, less than once a week and/or for less than
    3 months.
3. **Binge-eating disorder (of low frequency and/or limited duration):** All of the cri-
    teria for binge-eating disorder are met, except that the binge eating occurs, on av-
    erage, less than once a week and/or for less than 3 months.
4. **Purging disorder:** Recurrent purging behavior to influence weight or shape (e.g.,
    self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications) in the
    absence of binge eating.
5. **Night eating syndrome:** Recurrent episodes of night eating, as manifested by
    eating after awakening from sleep or by excessive food consumption after the eve-
    ning meal. There is awareness and recall of the eating. The night eating is not bet-
    ter explained by external influences such as changes in the individual’s sleep-wake
    cycle or by local social norms. The night eating causes significant distress and/or
    impairment in functioning. The disordered pattern of eating is not better explained
    by binge-eating disorder or another mental disorder, including substance use, and
    is not attributable to another medical disorder or to an effect of medication.

Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder **307.50 (F50.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a feeding
and eating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class.
The unspecified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific
feeding and eating disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).


**232** DSM-5 Guidebook

KEY POINTS

- This chapter combines the feeding disorders, formerly placed in the DSM-IV
    chapter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adoles-
    cence,” with the eating disorders. Both groups of disorders are characterized by
    disturbed consummatory behaviors.
- The criteria for pica and rumination disorder have been revised to ensure that the
    disorders can be diagnosed in persons of all ages. Similarly, avoidant/restrictive
    food intake disorder no longer has an age restriction.
- The requirement that anorexia nervosa be accompanied by amenorrhea has
    been dropped because research showed little difference between those with or
    without the symptom.
- With bulimia nervosa, the only change in the criteria is a reduction in the re-
    quired minimum average frequency of binge eating and inappropriate compen-
    satory behavior to one episode per week (Criterion C), because research did
    not support the requirement in DSM-IV for two episodes per week.
- Binge-eating disorder has been elevated to full disorder status in DSM-5.


# CHAPTER 12

## Elimination Disorders

**307.6 (F98.0)** Enuresis
**307.7 (F98.1)** Encopresis
Other Specified Elimination Disorder
Unspecified Elimination Disorder

## This chapter describes conditions in which the predominant

disturbance is related to bowel or bladder problems. Elimination disorders are usu-
ally first diagnosed in childhood and include enuresis and encopresis (Table 12–1).
Placed in the chapter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or
Adolescence” in DSM-III and DSM-IV, elimination disorders are now contained in a
stand-alone chapter, which reflects a change in categorization recommended by the
Childhood and Adolescent Disorders Work Group.

**TABLE 12–1. DSM-5 elimination disorders**

```
Enuresis
Encopresis
Other specified elimination disorder
Unspecified elimination disorder
```
Elimination disorders are common, with approximately 1% of children age 5 years
having encopresis and 5%–10% of 5-year-olds having nocturnal enuresis. These dis-
orders can continue into adolescence, with approximately 1% of adolescents experi-
encing nocturnal enuresis.
At least among older children, these disorders can be very embarrassing and have
a negative impact on self-esteem. Impairment is often a reflection of how the disor-
ders contribute to social ostracism and social withdrawal by the individuals, and to
anger and rejection by caregivers.

###### 233


**234** DSM-5 Guidebook

Most elimination disorders have a functional cause and are not a neurological or
medical condition. Children with these disorders are usually first evaluated by pedi-
atricians and not mental health clinicians. This may reflect not only the obvious phys-
ical nature of the symptoms but also the ongoing controversy regarding when and to
what extent these disorders are manifestations of underlying emotional problems.

Enuresis

Enuresis is characterized by repeated urination into clothing or the bed. The behavior
is most often involuntary but it is sometimes intentional. Enuresis commonly occurs
during nighttime sleep (nocturnal subtype) but it may also occur while the person is
awake (diurnal subtype). Clinical judgment is necessary to assess the frequency of the be-
havior, the age beyond which it is appropriate, and the degree of distress or impairment
associated with enuresis. The DSM-5 criteria reflect no substantive proposed changes
to the DSM-IV criteria for enuresis.

Diagnostic Criteria for Enuresis **307.6 (F98.0)**

A. Repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes, whether involuntary or intentional.
B. The behavior is clinically significant as manifested by either a frequency of at least
twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months or the presence of clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of
functioning.
C. Chronological age is at least 5 years (or equivalent developmental level).
D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
diuretic, an antipsychotic medication) or another medical condition (e.g., diabetes,
spina bifida, a seizure disorder).

Specify whether:
**Nocturnal only:** Passage of urine only during nighttime sleep.
**Diurnal only:** Passage of urine during waking hours.
**Nocturnal and diurnal:** A combination of the two subtypes above.

Criterion A

This criterion clarifies that enuresis can be either involuntary or intentional. (DSM-III
required involuntary voiding.) The inclusion of intentional voiding allows the diag-
nosis to be made in children who are too embarrassed to ask to use the bathroom.

Criterion B

Given that short-term episodes of bed-wetting are common, the criterion requires a
frequency and duration of at least twice weekly for at least 3 consecutive months, or
the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment, in order to make the di-


**_Elimination Disorders_** **235**

agnosis. In contrast, the World Health Organization defines enuresis as wetting twice
per month (under age 7 years) or once per month (age 7 years and older) in the past
3 months.

Criterion C

The minimal age criterion has been set at 5 years, but medical guidelines vary on
when a child is old enough to stay dry. The majority of children are toilet trained for
daytime by age 5 years, and nighttime toilet training usually happens several months
later than daytime toilet training. Therefore, although it has been common practice to
define enuresis as abnormal from age 5 years, many only consider treatment for chil-
dren when they are at least 7 years old.

Criterion D

Medical conditions must be excluded as a cause of the bed-wetting. These include
neurological disorders (e.g., seizures, spina bifida), other medical conditions (e.g., uri-
nary tract infections, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, sleep apnea), and structural causes
(e.g., urinary tract obstruction, congenital defect of the posterior valve of the urethra).
As with any clinical problem, the clinician must exercise judgment and rule out alter-
native explanations for the condition.

Subtypes

_Nocturnal only_ is the most common subtype, and bed-wetting typically occurs during
the first one-third of the evening. The _diurnal only_ subtype is more common in girls.
Debate has focused on whether these subtypes are clinically useful or whether ex-
panded subtyping would be more appropriate. For example, “urge incontinence” and
“voiding postponement” are proposed subtypes of daytime enuresis that have been
associated with distinct behavioral problems and psychiatric comorbidity. The Interna-
tional Children’s Continence Society has suggested four subtypes of nocturnal enure-
sis based on whether the enuresis is primary (no dry period for longer than 6 months)
or secondary (relapse after at least a 6-month dry spell) and whether it is monosymp-
tomatic (no daytime bladder dysfunction) or nonmonosymptomatic (bladder symp-
toms such as urgency or voiding postponement can occur during the day).

Encopresis

_Encopresis_ refers to the repeated involuntary or occasionally intentional passage of fe-
ces into inappropriate places after the mental age of 4 years without any underlying
organic cause. Encopresis is most often caused by underlying functional constipation,
impaction, and retention with subsequent overflow. Encopresis can occur without
constipation, an event(s) often referred to as “nonretentive fecal soiling,” although this
type is less common. Encopresis is more common in boys. Children with soiling prob-
lems tend to have more psychological and behavioral problems than those without
(Joinson et al. 2006). No changes have been made in the criteria for DSM-5.


**236** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Encopresis **307.7 (F98.1)**

A. Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., clothing, floor), whether
involuntary or intentional.
B. At least one such event occurs each month for at least 3 months.
C. Chronological age is at least 4 years (or equivalent developmental level).
D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., lax-
atives) or another medical condition except through a mechanism involving consti-
pation.

Specify whether:
**With constipation and overflow incontinence:** There is evidence of constipation
on physical examination or by history.
**Without constipation and overflow incontinence:** There is no evidence of con-
stipation on physical examination or by history.

Criteria A and B

A diagnosis of encopresis requires defecating into inappropriate places at least once a
month for at least 3 months. This requirement is in keeping with the Rome Diagnostic Cri-
teria, a classification system created by pediatric gastroenterologists who set criteria for
functional gastrointestinal disorders in childhood (Drossman and Dumitrascu 2006).
These criteria have provided clinicians with a method for standardizing their definition
of clinical disorders and have allowed researchers from various fields to study the patho-
physiology and treatment of the same disorders from different points of view. The pas-
sage of feces may be either involuntary or intentional. When involuntary, the passage of
feces is often related to constipation, impaction, and retention with subsequent overflow.

Criterion C

Toilet training is usually completed by age 3 years, and the age requirement of 4 years
allows for some variability in normal toilet training. (In the case of children with devel-
opmental delays, the mental age must be at least 4 years.)

Criterion D

Medical explanations for the disturbance must be excluded before the diagnosis of
encopresis is made. Possible medical causes include use of laxatives, anorectal mal-
formations such as anal stenosis, spinal disorders (e.g., meningomyelocele, spinal
tumor), Hirschsprung’s disease, cerebral palsy, endocrine disorders (e.g., hypothy-
roidism, lead intoxication), and neuromuscular disorders.

Subtypes

Encopresis “with constipation and overflow incontinence” may result in feces that are
poorly formed and leakage occurring mostly during the day. The incontinence usu-


**_Elimination Disorders_** **237**

ally resolves after treatment of the constipation. Encopresis “without constipation
and overflow incontinence” usually results in feces of normal form and consistency
and is more likely to be associated with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct dis-
order. Although studies of children based on subtyping have found no significant dif-
ferences in behaviors or in social competence, subtyping of encopresis has treatment
implications. Disimpaction and laxatives may be needed if constipation is present,
whereas laxatives may worsen encopresis without constipation. Although DSM-5
does not define _constipation,_ the Rome Diagnostic Criteria require two of the follow-
ing symptoms: two or fewer defecations in the toilet per week; at least one episode of
fecal incontinence per week; history of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool
retention; history of painful or hard bowel movements; presence of a large fecal mass
in the rectum; and history of large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet.

Other Specified Elimination Disorder and

Unspecified Elimination Disorder

_Other specified elimination disorder_ refers to symptoms of an elimination disorder that
cause significant distress or impairment in functioning but fail to meet full diagnostic
criteria for any elimination disorder (e.g., passage of feces in inappropriate places for
only 2 months). The clinician can use this disorder category and communicate the rea-
son the symptoms or behavior did not meet full criteria for an elimination disorder. The
clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., “low-frequency enuresis”).
_Unspecified elimination disorder_ should be used when an individual presents with
symptoms that are characteristic of an elimination disorder, with distress and func-
tional impairment, but that do not meet full diagnostic criteria and the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason the full criteria were not met, or there was insuffi-
cient information to do so.

Other Specified Elimination Disorder

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an elimi-
nation disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified elimination disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician choos-
es to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria
for any specific elimination disorder. This is done by recording “other specified elimina-
tion disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “low-frequency enuresis”).

**Coding note:** Code **788.39 (N39.498)** for other specified elimination disorder with uri-
nary symptoms; **787.60 (R15.9)** for other specified elimination disorder with fecal
symptoms.

Unspecified Elimination Disorder

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an elimi-
nation disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The un-
specified elimination disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician choos-
es not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific elimination disorder,
and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

**Coding note:** Code **788.30 (R32)** for unspecified elimination disorder with urinary
symptoms; **787.60 (R15.9)** for unspecified elimination disorder with fecal symptoms.

KEY POINTS

- Now a separate diagnostic class, elimination disorders have been moved from
    the chapter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Ado-
    lescence.”
- DSM-5 recognizes that enuresis may be intentional or involuntary.

**240** DSM-5 Guidebook

Dysfunction in sleep or waking is among the most common rea-
sons people seek health care. The maintenance of a normal cycle of sleep and wake-
fulness is an important component of successful adaptation across the life cycle
because robust circadian rhythms help regulate mood and enhance cognitive perfor-
mance. Problems with sleep, sleep quality, and daytime alertness have enormous im-
pact on quality of life and level of functioning.
The four stages of sleep include rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and three stages
of non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Stage 1 NREM sleep is characterized by
the disappearance of alpha waves and the appearance of theta waves on the electro-
encephalogram (EEG). Hypnic jerks are common in this stage. In stage 2 NREM sleep,
sleep spindles and K-complexes are found on the EEG. Previously separated into two
stages, stage 3 NREM sleep is _slow-wave sleep,_ or deep sleep. Delta waves are seen on
the EEG. Dreaming is more common in this stage than in other stages of NREM sleep
but not as common as in REM sleep. REM sleep is characterized by rapid eye move-
ment, low muscle tone, and rapid, low-voltage electroencephalographic activity. REM
sleep alternates with periods of NREM sleep approximately every 90 minutes; in
adults, REM sleep typically occupies 20%–25% of total sleep. During a normal night’s
sleep, most adults experience four to five periods of REM sleep. The REM episodes
increase in duration during the night. The relative amount of REM sleep varies with
age, with older age associated with less efficient sleep and less time spent in REM
sleep.
Dysfunction in any of these sleep stages may result in a sleep-wake disorder. DSM
has long recognized sleep disorders in some fashion. Somnambulism, or sleepwalk-
ing disorder, was the first sleep-wake disorder included in DSM-I. The disorder name
was changed to disorder of sleep in DSM-II. DSM-III included both sleepwalking dis-
order and sleep terror disorder, but they were placed with the “Disorders Usually
First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.” A stand-alone chapter was
developed for DSM-III-R and included the variety of disorders that are now recog-
nized as sleep disorders. Several disorders were added to DSM-IV, such as narcolepsy
and breathing-related sleep disorder.
DSM-5 recognizes 12 specific sleep-wake disorders as well as several other speci-
fied and unspecified disorders (Table 13–1). The chapter revision has been influenced
by the second edition of the _International Classification of Sleep Disorders_ (ICSD-2), pub-
lished by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2005). The ICSD-2 contains over
70 specific sleep-wake diagnoses grouped into eight categories: insomnia, breathing-
related sleep disorders, hypersomnias of central origin, circadian rhythm sleep disor-
ders, parasomnias, sleep-related movement disorders, isolated symptoms and normal
variants, and other sleep disorders. Although DSM-5 has not incorporated as many
diagnoses as are contained in the ICSD-2, the current diagnoses are compatible with
them.
The revisions in DSM-5 present a clinically useful approach to diagnosis. In DSM-
IV, sleep disorders required the clinician to determine if the sleeping problem was a
primary issue or a consequence of another problem. In DSM-5, use of the term _primary_
has been dropped in favor of simply listing insomnia disorder if diagnostic criteria are
met. Coexisting mental and physical disorders are listed, but without the use of terms

such as _related to_ or _due to,_ which were used in DSM-IV. Such terms imply a causal re-
lationship, which often cannot be established. By avoiding etiological assumptions,
the classification system reminds clinicians that insomnia disorder usually requires in-
dependent clinical attention in addition to management of coexisting mental and
physical disorders. The changes also recognize the bidirectional and interactive effects
between sleep disorders and coexisting medical and mental disorders.
The clinician confronted with complaints of sleep disturbance must define the na-
ture of the complaint, whether primarily insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, dis-
turbed mentation or behavior during sleep, or difficulties in the circadian placement
of sleep. The first step in diagnosis should be to consider the individual’s general
medical condition, to determine whether the complaint represents a sleep disorder at-


**242** DSM-5 Guidebook

tributable to another medical condition. Furthermore, if the individual is taking a
medication or using a substance, the clinician will need to consider the possibility of
a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder.
If the main complaint is persistent insomnia and/or difficulty initiating or main-
taining sleep, a diagnosis of insomnia disorder may be appropriate. If the primary
complaint is excessive sleepiness, the clinician should consider the differential diag-
nosis of a hypersomnolence disorder, narcolepsy, or one of the breathing-related sleep
disorders. If the individual frequently travels or is involved in shift work, or has a
problem of sleep timing, a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder should be consid-
ered. If the individual’s symptoms consist of predominantly behavioral or mental
events during sleep (e.g., abrupt awakening, frightening dreams, or walking about
while sleeping), the clinician should consider a diagnosis of an NREM sleep arousal
disorder.

Insomnia Disorder

_Insomnia,_ which is Latin for “no sleep,” involves the predominant complaint of an in-
ability to fall asleep or remain asleep. The word is also used to describe the condition
of waking up not feeling restored or refreshed. Insomnia is the most common sleep
complaint in the general population. It can be either acute (i.e., lasting one to several
nights) or chronic (i.e., persisting for 1 month or longer). According to the National
Center on Sleep Disorders Research at the National Institutes of Health, about 30%–40%
of adults say they have symptoms of insomnia within a given year, and about 10%–15%
of adults report chronic insomnia (National Institutes of Health 2005). Among individ-
uals reporting chronic insomnia, most have chronic or intermittent symptoms, meaning
that they experience difficulty sleeping for a few nights, followed by a few nights of
adequate sleep before the problem returns.
Among those who report insomnia, sleep maintenance insomnia is the most fre-
quent problem, followed by difficulty falling asleep and then early morning awaken-
ing. Complaints of poor sleep or insomnia increase with age, paralleling age-related
changes in sleep-stage physiology. Young people with insomnia more frequently re-
port difficulty falling asleep, whereas older individuals report middle and terminal
insomnia. Furthermore, women of all ages report more sleep problems than men. De-
spite the large number of people with insomnia complaints, relatively few seek med-
ical attention.
Insomnia can be a disorder in its own right or a symptom of another condition. Stress
and worry are frequently blamed for insomnia. Insomnia can also occur with jet lag,
shift work, and other major schedule changes. Research has consistently found a ro-
bust association between insomnia and psychiatric disorders—particularly depres-
sion and anxiety—across the life cycle. Persistent sleep disturbance was identified in
the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study as a highly significant risk factor for the
_subsequent_ development of major depressive disorder (Ford and Kamerow 1989).
Hence, early intervention to treat sleep disturbance might protect against depression.
Many changes have been made in the criteria for DSM-5 sleep-wake disorders.
Three DSM-IV disorders—primary insomnia, insomnia related to another mental dis-


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **243**

order, and sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, insomnia type—have
been merged into the single DSM-5 diagnostic entity of insomnia disorder. The change
moves away from the need to make causal attributions between co-occurring disor-
ders, and acknowledges the interactive effects between sleep disorders and co-occur-
ring medical or psychiatric conditions. Data show that in the majority of insomnia
cases, the individual presents with another psychiatric or medical disorder, as op-
posed to the insomnia being a disorder on its own (i.e., primary insomnia in DSM-IV).
Furthermore, the diagnostic reliability of insomnia, particularly primary insomnia,
was relatively poor. Distinguishing between primary insomnia and insomnia due to
a mental disorder or a medical condition was often difficult (or impossible), and the
construct of secondary insomnia often led to undertreatment. In eliminating the dis-
tinction between primary and secondary insomnia, DSM-5 emphasizes that sleep dis-
orders warrant independent clinical attention.

Diagnostic Criteria for Insomnia Disorder **307.42 (F51.01)**

A. A predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, associ-
ated with one (or more) of the following symptoms:

1. Difficulty initiating sleep. (In children, this may manifest as difficulty ini-
    tiating sleep without caregiver intervention.)
2. Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakenings or problems
    returning to sleep after awakenings. (In children, this may manifest as difficulty
    returning to sleep without caregiver intervention.)
3. Early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.

B. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other important areas of func-
tioning.
C. The sleep difficulty occurs at least 3 nights per week.
D. The sleep difficulty is present for at least 3 months.
E. The sleep difficulty occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep.
F. The insomnia is not better explained by and does not occur exclusively during the
course of another sleep-wake disorder (e.g., narcolepsy, a breathing-related sleep
disorder, a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, a parasomnia).
G. The insomnia is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication).
H. Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately explain the
predominant complaint of insomnia.

Specify if:
**With non–sleep disorder mental comorbidity,** including substance use disorders
**With other medical comorbidity
With other sleep disorder
Coding note:** The code 780.52 (G47.00) applies to all three specifiers. Code also the
relevant associated mental disorder, medical condition, or other sleep disorder imme-
diately after the code for insomnia disorder in order to indicate the association.


**244** DSM-5 Guidebook

Specify if:
**Episodic:** Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.
**Persistent:** Symptoms last 3 months or longer.
**Recurrent:** Two (or more) episodes within the space of 1 year.

**Note:** Acute and short-term insomnia (i.e., symptoms lasting less than 3 months but
otherwise meeting all criteria with regard to frequency, intensity, distress, and/or im-
pairment) should be coded as an other specified insomnia disorder.

Criterion A

DSM-5 has integrated the construct of sleep dissatisfaction into the definition of insom-
nia. Evidence suggests that the presence of sleep dissatisfaction in addition to insomnia
symptoms increases considerably the proportion of individuals with daytime impair-
ments relative to those with insomnia symptoms alone. Hence, adding sleep dissatis-
faction to the definition of insomnia is likely to improve diagnostic specificity. This
change could also improve detection of clinically significant insomnia among sub-
groups of individuals (e.g., older adults) who typically report little impairment or dis-
tress associated with insomnia symptoms but who are otherwise dissatisfied with their
sleep. Criterion A requires dissatisfaction with quantity or quality regarding initiating
sleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning awakenings. In addition, the criterion spe-
cifically highlights how these requirements may differ in children—that children may
manifest difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep without caregiver intervention.

Criterion B

This criterion lists specific examples of the distress or impairments in daytime func-
tioning resulting from insomnia. Many individuals with persistent insomnia (e.g.,
older adults) tend to minimize or underestimate the impact of insomnia on their day-
time functioning, partly due to the lack of clear indicators of such impairments. This is
likely to lead to underdiagnosis and absence of treatment. The addition of specific ex-
amples of impairments may enhance assessment and boost recognition of the impact of
insomnia on daytime functioning.

Criteria C and D

Criterion C requires that the sleep disturbance be present for at least 3 nights each week
(an addition in DSM-5). The minimum frequency criterion of 3 nights per week will dif-
ferentiate individuals with occasional (subthreshold) insomnia from those with more
clinically meaningful insomnia. Sensitivity and specificity indices are maximized (i.e.,
correct identification of true insomnia cases and correct exclusion of false positives), with
a frequency of occurrence of insomnia falling between 3 and 4 nights per week. Also, this
frequency criterion is consistent with that used in ICD-10 and with current research prac-
tices in the field. Evidence suggests that the frequency of occurrence of insomnia symp-
toms is an important determinant of morbidity and impairment.
The minimum duration of 3 months (Criterion D) reflects a change from the previ-
ous requirement of 1 month, which was a very short period to define insomnia as a


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **245**

chronic condition. By comparison, few psychiatric or medical conditions are considered
chronic before they exceed 6- or 12-month durations. Insomnia lasting only 1 month
might be better conceptualized as an _episode_ rather than a disorder. Morbidity may
also increase with insomnia persisting longer than 3 months.

Criterion E

This criterion requires that the sleep disturbance occur despite adequate opportunity
for sleep. This criterion was added to help distinguish clinical insomnia from voli-
tional sleep deprivation.

Criteria F, G, and H

These criteria are for ruling out other mental disorders and medical conditions. They
indicate that the insomnia is not better explained by another sleep disorder, such as
narcolepsy (or does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep disor-
der); is not due to the effects of a substance (e.g., caffeine); and is not better explained
by a coexisting medical condition or mental disorder.

Specifiers

Co-occurring mental health, substance use, and sleep disorders can be specified. In
addition, there are three specifiers for the course of insomnia disorder: _episodic_ (symp-
toms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months), _persistent_ (symptoms last 3 months
or longer), and _recurrent_ (two or more episodes occur within the space of 1 year). Per-
sistent insomnia is also associated with long-term consequences, including increased
risks of major depressive disorder, hypertension, and myocardial infarction; increased
absenteeism and reduced productivity at work; reduced quality of life; and increased
economic burden.

Hypersomnolence Disorder

Excessive sleepiness poses a great challenge to the nearly one-third of adult Ameri-
cans who report this problem (Ohayon et al. 2012). Although most healthy people re-
quire approximately 7 hours of sleep during the main sleep episode to feel refreshed
and alert, many individuals curtail their sleep to meet social, vocational, or other de-
mands. This exacts a high price, and many of these people struggle with excessive day-
time sleepiness when they should be fully awake.
Excessive sleepiness can be associated with many sleep disorders, such as obstruc-
tive sleep apnea hypopnea, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, and restless legs
syndrome. It can also be induced by insomnia disorder, insufficient sleep, or poor sleep
hygiene. When excessive sleepiness is associated with other symptoms, it qualifies for
the diagnosis hypersomnolence disorder.
Dement et al. (1966) proposed that individuals with excessive daytime sleepiness,
but without cataplexy, sleep paralysis, or sleep-onset REM periods, not be considered
as having narcolepsy. Roth et al. (1972) later described a type of hypersomnia with
sleep drunkenness that consists of difficulty coming to complete wakefulness, confu-


**246** DSM-5 Guidebook

sion, disorientation, poor motor coordination, and slowness, accompanied by deep
and prolonged sleep. Abrupt sleep attacks seen in classic narcolepsy are not present
in hypersomnolence disorder.
DSM-5 hypersomnolence disorder should be distinguished from excessive sleepi-
ness related to insufficient sleep and from fatigue (tiredness not necessarily relieved by
increased sleep and unrelated to sleep quantity or quality). Excessive sleepiness and fa-
tigue are difficult to differentiate from hypersomnolence disorder and may overlap con-
siderably. Individuals with this disorder have no difficulty falling asleep and have a
sleep efficiency generally higher than 90%. They may experience confusional arousal
upon awakening in the morning but also upon awakening from a daytime nap. During
that period, the person appears awake but his or her behavior may be very inappropri-
ate, with memory deficits, disorientation in time and space, and slow mentation and
speech. The reduced vigilance and impaired cognitive response return to normal within
30–60 minutes (and sometimes longer). For some individuals with hypersomnolence
disorder, the duration of the major sleep episode (nocturnal sleep for most individuals)
is 9 hours or more. However, approximately 80% of individuals with a hypersomno-
lence disorder report their sleep as being nonrestorative, and just as many have difficul-
ties awakening in the morning. Individuals with a hypersomnolence disorder may have
daytime naps nearly every day regardless of the nocturnal sleep duration.
Several changes have been made from DSM-IV. DSM-5 has replaced the term _hyper-
somnia_ with _hypersomnolence._ The disorder is characterized by a complaint of excessive
sleepiness, which can be expressed in two main categories of symptoms: 1) excessive
quantity of sleep, referring to extended nocturnal sleep or involuntary daytime sleep,
and 2) deteriorated quality of wakefulness, referring to sleep propensity during
wakefulness as shown by difficulty awakening or inability to remain awake when re-
quired. With DSM-IV, in many cases, severe excessive sleepiness symptoms remained
undiagnosed because the excessive sleepiness was related to the quality of wakefulness,
not the _quantity_ of sleep. The term _hypersomnia_ describes an excessive amount of sleep,
whereas _hypersomnolence_ refers to the main symptom of excessive sleepiness. Research
shows that many individuals have excessive sleepiness that is not explained by an-
other sleep disorder, but with normal amounts of sleep.
Epidemiological and clinical data indicate that individuals with hypersomnolence
disorder often present with other psychiatric or medical conditions. DSM-5 has re-
placed three disorders—primary hypersomnia, hypersomnia related to another mental
disorder, and sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, hypersomnia type—
with a single diagnostic entity with specification of clinically comorbid conditions.
The change in the terminology removes the need to make causal attributions between
coexisting disorders and acknowledges the interactive effects of sleep disorders and co-
existing medical and/or psychiatric disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Hypersomnolence Disorder **307.44 (F51.11)**

A. Self-reported excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence) despite a main sleep pe-
riod lasting at least 7 hours, with at least one of the following symptoms:


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **247**

1. Recurrent periods of sleep or lapses into sleep within the same day.
2. A prolonged main sleep episode of more than 9 hours per day that is nonrestor-
    ative (i.e., unrefreshing).
3. Difficulty being fully awake after abrupt awakening.

B. The hypersomnolence occurs at least three times per week, for at least 3 months.
C. The hypersomnolence is accompanied by significant distress or impairment in
cognitive, social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The hypersomnolence is not better explained by and does not occur exclusively
during the course of another sleep disorder (e.g., narcolepsy, breathing-related
sleep disorder, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, or a parasomnia).
E. The hypersomnolence is not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-
stance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).
F. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not adequately explain the predomi-
nant complaint of hypersomnolence.

Specify if:
**With mental disorder,** including substance use disorders
**With medical condition
With another sleep disorder
Coding note:** The code 780.54 (G47.10) applies to all three specifiers. Code also
the relevant associated mental disorder, medical condition, or other sleep disorder
immediately after the code for hypersomnolence disorder in order to indicate the
association.

Specify if:
**Acute:** Duration of less than 1 month.
**Subacute:** Duration of 1–3 months.
**Persistent:** Duration of more than 3 months.

Specify current severity:
Specify severity based on degree of difficulty maintaining daytime alertness as mani-
fested by the occurrence of multiple attacks of irresistible sleepiness within any given
day occurring, for example, while sedentary, driving, visiting with friends, or working.
**Mild:** Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 1–2 days/week.
**Moderate:** Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 3–4 days/week.
**Severe:** Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 5–7 days/week.

Criterion A

The clinical description of excessive sleepiness symptoms in DSM-IV was vague (i.e.,
complaint of excessive sleepiness “as evidenced by either prolonged sleep episodes
or daytime sleep episodes that occur almost daily”). In many cases, severe excessive
sleepiness symptoms remained undiagnosed because the excessive sleepiness was re-
lated to the _quality_ of wakefulness, not the _quantity_ of sleep. Additionally, in DSM-IV,
no cut point was given to delineate what constituted a prolonged sleep episode. The
threshold of 9 hours as indicative of a prolonged main sleep episode will help identify
individuals with excessive amount of sleep. The choice of 9 hours was based on clinical


**248** DSM-5 Guidebook

evidence that individuals with hypersomnolence disorder (with or without long sleep
time) sleep on average 8–8.5 hours on weekdays, and it represents the upper fifth per-
centile of the normal sleep distribution in the general population.
The DSM-IV symptom “daytime sleep episodes” has been refined: “Recurrent pe-
riods of sleep or lapses into sleep within the same day.” This change allows for the
inclusion of individuals who have a main sleep period of normal duration, defined as
at least 7 hours of sleep, and have recurrent sleepiness episodes within the same day
(at least two episodes). The duration of 7 hours was adopted because it is the average
sleep duration of healthy adults, and it should reduce the possibility of including in-
dividuals whose excessive sleepiness might be due to insufficient sleep.
DSM-5 has added “difficulty being fully awake after abrupt awakening” as a core
feature of excessive sleepiness. Difficulty in awakening from sleep is present in the ma-
jority of individuals (up to 78%) with hypersomnolence characterized by a long sleep
time. Sleep inertia (sleep drunkenness) has been reported in 21%–72% of individuals
with a hypersomnolence disorder. The addition of this symptom will increase precision
in the identification of hypersomnolent individuals.

Criterion B

DSM-5 has added a minimum frequency criterion (i.e., three times per week) with ex-
cessive sleepiness. The frequency criterion (at least three times per week) was selected
based on population data indicating that it was the best cutoff for sleepiness in terms
of identifying individuals reporting impairment or distress associated with excessive
sleepiness. The DSM-5 criterion replaces the “almost daily” requirement in DSM-IV
and will help distinguish individuals with occasional sleepiness from those with more
severe symptoms of excessive sleepiness.
DSM-5 also requires that the excessive sleepiness last at least 3 months. DSM-IV
required a duration of 1 month, but that was perceived as too short a period to define
excessive sleepiness as a chronic condition. Given that hypersomnolence disorder is
generally a chronic condition, typically beginning in early adulthood, a time frame that
reflects longer-term chronicity was chosen.

Criterion C

Irritability and cognitive dysfunction are frequent concerns of hypersomnolent indi-
viduals. Other symptoms may include anxiety, decreased energy, restlessness, slow
speech, loss of appetite, and memory difficulties. Some individuals lose the ability to
function in family, social, occupational, or other settings. Motor vehicle accidents are
among the most serious of consequences stemming from excessive sleepiness. The Na-
tional Sleep Foundation’s (2005) Sleep in America poll indicated that 60% of behind-
the-wheel adults have driven a motor vehicle while drowsy, and 13% have actually fallen
asleep while driving at least once per month.

Criteria D, E, and F

Individuals with breathing-related sleep disorders may have patterns of excessive
sleepiness, and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are also often characterized by


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **249**

daytime sleepiness. Complaints of daytime sleepiness may occur with medical con-
ditions (e.g., a major neurocognitive disorder), medications (e.g., antipsychotics), or
mental disorders (e.g., during a major depressive episode or the depressed phase of
bipolar disorder). A diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder can be made in the pres-
ence of another current or past mental disorder as long as the other disorder does not
completely explain the hypersomnolence.

Specifiers

The clinician may specify the presence of comorbid conditions: another mental disor-
der, including substance use disorders; another medical condition; and another sleep
disorder. In each case, the specifier helps clarify the individual’s condition.
In addition to the specifiers regarding co-occurring conditions, there are three
specifiers available to describe course: _acute_ (duration of less than 1 month), _subacute_
(duration of 1–3 months), and _persistent_ (duration of more than 3 months). Severity
specifiers, based on difficulty maintaining daytime alertness, are included as well.

Narcolepsy

Narcolepsy is a disorder that leads to instability in the sleep-wake cycle. It causes ex-
cessive daytime sleepiness and leads to sudden onsets of REM sleep. Narcolepsy can
put severe limitations on individuals’ lives because of their inability to stay awake for
long periods of time and because of the risk that accompanies sudden bouts of sleep-
ing. It is a chronic condition that is treatable but not curable. Symptoms usually begin
either between ages 15 and 25 years or between ages 30 and 35 years, but they can be-
gin at any age. They include episodes of extreme drowsiness every 3–4 hours, dream-
like hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy (i.e., loss of all muscle tone in the body),
and “sleep attacks” (i.e., short attacks triggered by varying conditions such as eating
large meals, moments of high stress or tension, or being awake for more than 4 hours).
Cataplexy can cause a person’s head to drop or knees to buckle, or might cause the
person to collapse in his or her seat or onto the floor, potentially leading to dangerous
consequences.
The term _narcolepsy_ was first used in 1880 by the French neurologist Gélineau, who
used the term to describe a syndrome of recurrent, irresistible daytime sleep episodes,
sometimes accompanied by sudden falls (Morin and Edinger 2009). The disorder was
first included in DSM-IV and continues to be recognized in DSM-5. In the ICSD-2, both
narcolepsy with catalepsy and narcolepsy without catalepsy are recognized as dis-
tinctive subtypes.
Evidence shows that narcolepsy is associated with a lowered amount of a protein
called _hypocretin_ in the brain. In the 1990s, hypocretin-2 gene deletions were found to
be the disease mechanism in canine narcolepsy. In human studies, low levels of hypo-
cretin-1 are found in the cerebrospinal fluid of narcolepsy patients, and losses of over
80% of hypocretin (orexin)–producing neurons in the dorsolateral hypothalamus have
been reported in autopsy studies. One explanation might be that hypocretin-produc-
ing cells are destroyed by an autoimmune process.


**250** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Narcolepsy

A. Recurrent periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping
occurring within the same day. These must have been occurring at least three
times per week over the past 3 months.
B. The presence of at least one of the following:

1. Episodes of cataplexy, defined as either (a) or (b), occurring at least a few
    times per month:
    a. In individuals with long-standing disease, brief (seconds to minutes) epi-
       sodes of sudden bilateral loss of muscle tone with maintained conscious-
       ness that are precipitated by laughter or joking.
    b. In children or in individuals within 6 months of onset, spontaneous grimaces
       or jaw-opening episodes with tongue thrusting or a global hypotonia, with-
       out any obvious emotional triggers.
2. Hypocretin deficiency, as measured using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocre-
    tin-1 immunoreactivity values (less than or equal to one-third of values ob-
    tained in healthy subjects tested using the same assay, or less than or equal
    to 110 pg/mL). Low CSF levels of hypocretin-1 must not be observed in the
    context of acute brain injury, inflammation, or infection.
3. Nocturnal sleep polysomnography showing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
    latency less than or equal to 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test show-
    ing a mean sleep latency less than or equal to 8 minutes and two or more
    sleep-onset REM periods.

**Severe:** Drug-resistant cataplexy with multiple attacks daily, nearly constant
sleepiness, and disturbed nocturnal sleep (i.e., movements, insomnia, and vivid
dreaming).

Criterion A

The wording of Criterion A has been changed from “Irresistible attacks of refreshing
sleep that occur daily over at least 3 months” to focus on recurrent periods of an irre-
pressible need to sleep, lapses into sleep, or naps, occurring at least three times per
week over the previous 3 months (when the individual is untreated).

Criterion B

In DSM-IV, only one of two criteria had to be met. In this revision, at least one of three
criteria has to be met. Narcolepsy was originally described with the presence of cata-
plexy. Cataplexy is usually triggered by strong emotions, but studies have shown the
type of emotions is more important than the intensity. Interestingly, joking is the most
specific trigger that distinguishes true cataplexy in individuals with narcolepsy from
other experiences reported by individuals without narcolepsy. Laughter is also com-
monly involved, although it may be more culturally dependent because mirth is the
true trigger. In addition, cataplexy is almost always brief, and fewer than 15% of pa-
tients report that their attacks last longer than 2 minutes. From 5% to 10% of persons
report having one attack per year (or fewer), and less than 20% report having attacks
at least monthly (Dauvilliers et al. 2007). For this reason, several attacks per month is
considered a reasonable frequency. For young children, the disorder may have a rapid
onset that can occur over a few weeks. In these cases, cataplexy manifests differently,
by semiconstant, tic-like partial hypotonia of the jaw with tongue protrusion or even
a generalized weakness without a clear trigger. These rare cases evolve into the more
classic form (with usual trigger) within 6 months to 1 year.
The finding of low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels in individuals
with narcolepsy has been replicated by investigators around the world. The particu-
lar threshold of less than or equal to one-third of mean control values, or 110 pg/mL,
has been established by quantitative ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves
comparing samples drawn from individuals with narcolepsy with samples from
healthy controls, patients with other sleep disorders (including narcolepsy without
cataplexy, hypersomnia, insomnia), and patients with various acute or chronic neuro-
logical conditions (Burgess and Scammell 2012). Additionally, normal subjects essen-


**252** DSM-5 Guidebook

tially never have low CSF hypocretin levels, but some patients with severe acute
neurological disorders (e.g., acute meningitis, severe head trauma) can have decreased
CSF hypocretin, a finding that is reversible when or if the condition improves. Narco-
lepsy with cataplexy is almost always caused by hypocretin deficiency. Almost all pa-
tients with cataplexy have low or undetectable levels of hypocretin-1 in the CSF. In
contrast, only 5%–30% of cases without cataplexy have low CSF hypocretin-1 levels.
In the late 1950s, it was discovered that individuals with narcolepsy also have a
short REM sleep latency, a finding that led to using the multiple sleep latency test
(MSLT) as a diagnostic test for narcolepsy (nocturnal sleep polysomnography show-
ing mean sleep latency 15 minutes or, more recently, MSLT showing mean sleep la-
tency 8 minutes with 2 sleep-onset REM periods in 4–5 naps as a positive test). The
MSLT for narcolepsy-cataplexy has shown about 95% sensitivity and specificity, both
when cataplexy is used as a gold standard and when CSF hypocretin has been mea-
sured. Research shows that the observation of a short REM latency during a nocturnal
sleep study is more specific (~ 99%) but less sensitive (~ 50%) than a positive MSLT
result (Andlauer et al. 2013). Sleep test criteria consistent with narcolepsy can be ei-
ther a sleep-onset REM period at night (i.e., REM sleep latency 15 minutes) or a posi-
tive MSLT finding.

Subtypes and Specifiers

The subtypes allow the clinician to be more specific about causation by pinpointing
the relationship of narcolepsy to hypocretin deficiency, chromosome 21 mutations,
type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurological disorders, or an infectious cause. Current sever-
ity (mild, moderate, severe) may also be specified.

BREATHING-RELATED SLEEP DISORDERS

Rather than having a single set of criteria for breathing-related sleep disorder, as pro-
vided in DSM-IV, DSM-5 provides specific diagnostic criteria for a spectrum of
breathing-related sleep disorders: obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep
apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation. Although these disorders may share com-
mon underlying physiological risk factors (respiratory control instability), physiolog-
ical and anatomical studies indicate differences in the pathogenesis of these disorders,
with central sleep apnea less dependent on structural airway abnormalities as com-
pared with obstructive sleep apnea, which is more dependent on increased upper air-
way resistance, and sleep-related hypoventilation, which is often comorbid with
other disorders that depress ventilation. DSM-5 provides an overview of these inter-
related disorders and specific definitions for each of these entities.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is the most common category of breathing-related
sleep disorders. It is a potentially serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly
stops and starts during sleep. A pause in breathing (and therefore total absence of
airflow) is called an _apnea_ episode. A decrease in airflow during breathing is called a


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **253**

_hypopnea_ episode. Almost everyone has brief apnea episodes during sleep. The per-
son with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is rarely aware of having difficulty
breathing, even upon awakening. When the muscles relax, a person’s airway narrows
or closes as he or she breathes in, and breathing may be inadequate for 10–20 seconds.
This period of inadequate breathing may lower the level of oxygen in the blood. The
brain senses this impaired breathing and briefly rouses the person from sleep.
The most noticeable sign of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is _snoring._ This is
recognized as a problem by others witnessing the individual during sleep episodes or
is suspected because of its effects on the body. Because the muscle tone of the body
ordinarily relaxes during sleep, and the airway at the throat is composed of walls of
soft tissue, which can collapse, it is not surprising that breathing can be obstructed
during sleep. Although a very minor degree of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is
considered to be within the bounds of normal sleep, and many individuals experi-
ence episodes of obstructive sleep apnea at some point in life, only a small percentage
of people are afflicted with chronic, severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.
Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea most commonly affects middle-age and older
adults and people who are overweight. Signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep ap-
nea hypopnea include excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia), loud snoring,
observed episodes of breathing cessation during sleep, abrupt awakenings accompa-
nied by shortness of breath, awakening with a dry mouth or sore throat, morning
headache, difficulty staying asleep (insomnia), and difficult-to-control high blood
pressure. The breathing disruptions impair the ability to reach the desired deep, rest-
ful phases of sleep, resulting in sleepiness during waking hours. Diagnosis is based
on polysomnographic findings and on symptoms.

Diagnostic Criteria for Obstructive Sleep
Apnea Hypopnea **327.23 (G47.33)**

A. Either (1) or (2):

1. Evidence by polysomnography of at least five obstructive apneas or hypop-
    neas per hour of sleep and either of the following sleep symptoms:
    a. Nocturnal breathing disturbances: snoring, snorting/gasping, or breathing
       pauses during sleep.
    b. Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient oppor-
       tunities to sleep that is not better explained by another mental disorder (in-
       cluding a sleep disorder) and is not attributable to another medical
       condition.
2. Evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more obstructive apneas and/or hypop-
    neas per hour of sleep regardless of accompanying symptoms.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Apnea hypopnea index is less than 15.
**Moderate:** Apnea hypopnea index is 15–30.
**Severe:** Apnea hypopnea index is greater than 30.


**254** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion A

DSM-5 includes symptoms of nocturnal breathing disturbances in the diagnostic cri-
teria for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Nocturnal symptoms reflect the occur-
rence of breathing disorders during the sleep period. Objective measurements of
snoring intensity correlate with apnea hypopnea index. Snoring and gasping contrib-
ute significantly to sleep apnea prediction and in some studies are the most signifi-
cant symptoms associated with sleep apnea. DSM-5 also includes polysomnographic
criteria in the diagnostic criteria. Symptom reports are not sufficiently sensitive or
specific to diagnose breathing-related sleep disorders, although they can be used as
screening tools.

Specifiers

The severity of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is delineated based on an apnea hy-
popnea index (i.e., the number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep, as deter-
mined by polysomnography or other overnight monitoring). The disorder is mild if the
index is less than 15, moderate if the index is between 15 and 30, and severe if the index
is greater than 30. Regardless of the apnea hypopnea index, the disorder is considered
to be more severe when apneas and hypopneas are accompanied by significant oxygen
hemoglobin desaturation or when sleep is severely fragmented as shown by an ele-
vated arousal index (arousal index greater than 30) or reduced stages in deep sleep.

Central Sleep Apnea

Central sleep apnea is a disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts dur-
ing sleep. It occurs because the brain fails to send proper signals to the muscles that
control breathing. In contrast, in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, a person cannot
breathe normally because of upper airway obstruction. Central sleep apnea is less com-
mon, accounting for fewer than 5% of sleep apnea cases.
Common signs and symptoms of central sleep apnea include observed episodes
of stopped breathing or abnormal breathing patterns during sleep, abrupt awaken-
ings accompanied by shortness of breath, shortness of breath relieved by sitting up,
difficulty staying asleep (insomnia), excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia), dif-
ficulty concentrating, morning headaches, and snoring. Although snoring indicates
some degree of increased obstruction of airflow, snoring may also be heard in the pres-
ence of central sleep apnea; however, snoring may not be as prominent with central
sleep apnea as it is with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Central sleep apnea is as-
sociated with several conditions, including heart failure and chronic opioid use.
In DSM-IV, central sleep apnea was included in the breathing-related sleep disor-
der diagnosis and did not have separate criteria. Specific diagnostic criteria for central
sleep apnea have been developed for DSM-5.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **255**

**780.57 (G47.37) Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use:** The pathogen-
esis of this subtype is attributed to the effects of opioids on the respiratory rhythm
generators in the medulla as well as the differential effects on hypoxic versus hy-
percapnic respiratory drive.

**Coding note** (for 780.57 [G47.37] code only): When an opioid use disorder is present,
first code the opioid use disorder: 305.50 (F11.10) mild opioid use disorder or 304.00
(F11.20) moderate or severe opioid use disorder; then code 780.57 (G47.37) central
sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use. When an opioid use disorder is not present
(e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), code only 780.57 (G47.37) central
sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use.

**Note:** See the section “Diagnostic Features” in DSM-5 text.

Specify current severity:
Severity of central sleep apnea is graded according to the frequency of the breathing
disturbances as well as the extent of associated oxygen desaturation and sleep frag-
mentation that occur as a consequence of repetitive respiratory disturbances.

Criteria A and B

Apnea episodes require polysomnographic data indicating five or more central ap-
neas per hour of sleep. Clinical symptoms are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to
diagnose central sleep apnea, although they can be used as a screening tool. Other
sleep disorders need to be ruled out as a cause of the disturbance.

Subtypes and Specifiers

Clinicians may indicate if 1) the disorder is idiopathic and unrelated to airway ob-
struction, 2) a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern is present (characterized by a pattern
of periodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central ap-
neas and hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are
accompanied by frequent arousals), or 3) the disorder appears to be comorbid with opi-
oid use. Current severity may also be recorded.


**256** DSM-5 Guidebook

Sleep-Related Hypoventilation

Sleep-related hypoventilation is the result of decreased respiration associated with el-
evated carbon dioxide levels during sleep. Sleep-related hypoventilation is character-
ized by frequent episodes of shallow breathing lasting longer than 10 seconds during
sleep. It is frequently associated with lung disease or neuromuscular or chest wall dis-
orders, or medication use.
DSM-5 provides specific diagnostic criteria for sleep-related hypoventilation rather
than, as in DSM-IV, incorporating the condition within the single criteria set for breath-
ing-related sleep disorder. Although breathing-related sleep disorders may share
common underlying physiological risk factors (respiratory control instability), phys-
iological and anatomical studies indicate differences in the pathogenesis of these dis-
orders, with sleep-related hypoventilation often comorbid with other disorders that
depress ventilation.

Diagnostic Criteria for Sleep-Related Hypoventilation

A. Polysomnograpy demonstrates episodes of decreased respiration associated with
elevated CO 2 levels. ( **Note:** In the absence of objective measurement of CO 2 , persis-
tent low levels of hemoglobin oxygen saturation unassociated with apneic/hypop-
neic events may indicate hypoventilation.)
B. The disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep disorder.

Specify whether:
**327.24 (G47.34) Idiopathic hypoventilation:** This subtype is not attributable to
any readily identified condition.
**327.25 (G47.35) Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation:** This subtype is a
rare congenital disorder in which the individual typically presents in the perinatal
period with shallow breathing, or cyanosis and apnea during sleep.
**327.26 (G47.36) Comorbid sleep-related hypoventilation:** This subtype occurs
as a consequence of a medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder (e.g., in-
terstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or a neuromuscular
or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular dystrophies, postpolio syndrome, cervical
spinal cord injury, kyphoscoliosis), or medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, opi-
ates). It also occurs with obesity (obesity hypoventilation disorder), where it re-
flects a combination of increased work of breathing due to reduced chest wall
compliance and ventilation-perfusion mismatch and variably reduced ventilatory
drive. Such individuals usually are characterized by body mass index of greater
than 30 and hypercapnia during wakefulness (with a pCO 2 of greater than 45), with-
out other evidence of hypoventilation. 

Specify current severity:
Severity is graded according to the degree of hypoxemia and hypercarbia present
during sleep and evidence of end organ impairment due to these abnormalities
(e.g., right-sided heart failure). The presence of blood gas abnormalities during wake-
fulness is an indicator of greater severity.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **257**

Criteria A and B

As is the case for the other sleep disorders, specific polysomnographic findings are
required for the diagnosis. Other sleep disorders need to be ruled out before making
this diagnosis.

Subtypes and Specifiers

The clinician can record whether the hypoventilation is idiopathic, attributable to the
rare congenital central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (which presents in the
perinatal period with shallow breathing, or cyanosis and apnea during sleep), or at-
tributable to a comorbid disorder such as a pulmonary disease. Current severity may be
indicated as well.

CIRCADIAN RHYTHM SLEEP-WAKE DISORDERS

Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders

Human beings have biological rhythms known as _circadian rhythms_ that are controlled
by a biological clock and that work on a daily time scale. The rhythms affect body
temperature, alertness, appetite, and hormone secretion, as well as sleep timing.
Because of a person’s circadian clock, sleepiness does not continuously increase as
time passes. A person’s desire and ability to fall asleep are influenced both by the length
of time since the person woke from an adequate sleep and by internal circadian
rhythms. Thus, the body is ready for sleep and for wakefulness at different times of
the day.
A circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder is a persistent or recurring pattern of sleep
disruption resulting either from an altered sleep-wake schedule or from an inequality
between a person’s natural sleep-wake cycle and the sleep-related demands placed
on him or her. The term _circadian rhythm_ refers to a person’s internal sleep- and wake-
related rhythms that occur throughout a 24-hour period. The sleep disruption leads
to insomnia or excessive sleepiness during the day, resulting in impaired functioning.
People with circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are unable to sleep and wake at
the times required for normal work, school, and social needs; however, they are gen-
erally able to get enough sleep if allowed to sleep and wake at the times dictated by
their body clocks. Unless they also have another sleep disorder, their sleep is of normal
quality.
DSM-5 circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder criteria differ from DSM-IV in two
notable areas. First, the name has changed from “circadian rhythm sleep disorders.”
Although it is well appreciated that individuals with circadian rhythm sleep-wake
disorders have difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, they also prominently
suffer from impairment of wakefulness and often seek treatment for excessive sleep-
iness. Thus, the term _sleep-wake_ captures the daytime and nighttime impairments in
function that are characteristic of circadian dysfunction. Second, specifiers have been
revised, as described later in this section.


**258** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Circadian Rhythm
Sleep-Wake Disorders

A. A persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that is primarily due to an alter-
ation of the circadian system or to a misalignment between the endogenous circa-
dian rhythm and the sleep–wake schedule required by an individual’s physical
environment or social or professional schedule.
B. The sleep disruption leads to excessive sleepiness or insomnia, or both.
C. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, and other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note:** For ICD-9-CM, code **307.45** for all subtypes. For ICD-10-CM, code is
based on subtype.

Specify whether:
**307.45 (G47.21) Delayed sleep phase type:** A pattern of delayed sleep onset and
awakening times, with an inability to fall asleep and awaken at a desired or con-
ventionally acceptable earlier time.
Specify if:
**Familial:** A family history of delayed sleep phase is present.
Specify if:
**Overlapping with non-24-hour sleep-wake type:** Delayed sleep phase
type may overlap with another circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, non-
24-hour sleep-wake type.
**307.45 (G47.22) Advanced sleep phase type:** A pattern of advanced sleep onset
and awakening times, with an inability to remain awake or asleep until the desired
or conventionally acceptable later sleep or wake times.
Specify if:
**Familial:** A family history of advanced sleep phase is present.
**307.45 (G47.23) Irregular sleep-wake type:** A temporally disorganized sleep-
wake pattern, such that the timing of sleep and wake periods is variable through-
out the 24-hour period.
**307.45 (G47.24) Non-24-hour sleep-wake type:** A pattern of sleep-wake cycles
that is not synchronized to the 24-hour environment, with a consistent daily drift
(usually to later and later times) of sleep onset and wake times.
**307.45 (G47.26) Shift work type:** Insomnia during the major sleep period and/or
excessive sleepiness (including inadvertent sleep) during the major awake period
associated with a shift work schedule (i.e., requiring unconventional work hours).
**307.45 (G47.20) Unspecified type**

Specify if:
**Episodic:** Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.
**Persistent:** Symptoms last 3 months or longer.
**Recurrent:** Two or more episodes occur within the space of 1 year.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **259**

Criteria A, B, and C

The sleep disruption is primarily due to a circadian system alteration or a mismatch
between the demands of the person’s environment or work/social schedule and the
person’s internal circadian sleep-wake cycle. This mismatch leads to sleep distur-
bances, which in turn result in excessive sleepiness or insomnia, or both, as well as dis-
tress or functional impairment.

Subtypes and Specifiers

Subtypes include delayed sleep phase type, advanced sleep phase type, irregular
sleep-wake type, non-24-hour sleep-wake type, and shift work type, as well as an un-
specified type. The delayed sleep phase type may be further specified as familial or
overlapping with non-24-hour sleep-wake type.
Delayed sleep phase type is based on a delay in the timing of the major sleep pe-
riod (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to the desired sleep and wake times, re-
sulting in difficulties waking in the morning and excessive sleepiness at work and
impaired sleep at home.
The diagnosis of advanced sleep phase type is based primarily on a history of an
advance in the timing of the major sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in rela-
tion to the desired sleep and wake times, which results in symptoms of early morning
insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. The rationale for inclusion of advanced
sleep phase type was based on strong empirical evidence of earlier timing of circa-
dian biomarkers, including melatonin and core body temperature rhythms, occurring
2–4 hours earlier than normal.
The diagnosis of irregular sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of
symptoms of insomnia at night (during the usual sleep period) and excessive sleepi-
ness (napping) during the day. This type is characterized by a lack of discernible
sleep-wake circadian rhythm. The individual has no major sleep period, and sleep is
fragmented into at least three periods during the 24-hour day. In otherwise healthy
subjects, the condition may be a result of very poor sleep hygiene; however, the irreg-
ular sleep-wake type is commonly associated with neurological impairment, such as
developmental disability in children and dementia in older adults.
The diagnosis of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of
symptoms of insomnia and/or excessive sleepiness due to lack of a stable entrain-
ment or synchronization between the timing of the endogenous circadian rhythm and
the 24-hour light-dark cycle. Individuals will typically present with periods of insom-
nia, excessive sleepiness, or both, alternating with asymptomatic periods. Starting
with the asymptomatic period when the individual’s sleep phase is aligned to the ex-
ternal environment, sleep latency will gradually increase and the individual will
complain of sleep-onset insomnia. As the sleep phase continues to drift so that clock-
drive for sleep is now in the daytime, individuals will have trouble staying awake
during the day and complain of sleepiness, with subsequent negative impact on af-
fect, cognition, and function. Because the circadian period is not aligned to the exter-
nal 24-hour environment, symptoms will depend on when an individual tries to sleep
in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity. The diagnosis of shift work


**260** DSM-5 Guidebook

type is based on a history of regularly scheduled work outside the daytime window
of 8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. This results in excessive sleepiness at work and impaired sleep
at home.
The DSM-IV jet lag subtype has been dropped. The jet lag subtype was removed
because travel across time zones typically involves transient or short-term impair-
ments, and the sleep-wake dysfunction may represent normal physiology rather than
a pathological response.

PARASOMNIAS

Parasomnias are disorders characterized by abnormal behavioral, experiential, or phys-
iological events occurring in association with sleep, specific sleep stages, or sleep-wake
transitions.

Non–Rapid Eye Movement

Sleep Arousal Disorders

The conditions making up the NREM sleep arousal disorders—sleepwalking and
sleep terrors—represent variations of the simultaneous admixture of elements of both
wakefulness and NREM sleep, a combination that results in the appearance of com-
plex motor behavior without conscious awareness (sometimes called “state dissocia-
tion”). The overlap of these conditions in people and in animals is well established.
The fact that human sleep can be characterized by the simultaneous coexistence of
wake-like and sleeplike electroencephalographic patterns in different cortical areas
supports the state-dissociation concept of NREM sleep arousal disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Non–Rapid Eye Movement
Sleep Arousal Disorders

A. Recurrent episodes of incomplete awakening from sleep, usually occurring during
the first third of the major sleep episode, accompanied by either one of the following:

1. **Sleepwalking:** Repeated episodes of rising from bed during sleep and walking
    about. While sleepwalking, the individual has a blank, staring face; is relatively
    unresponsive to the efforts of others to communicate with him or her; and can
    be awakened only with great difficulty.
2. **Sleep terrors:** Recurrent episodes of abrupt terror arousals from sleep, usually
    beginning with a panicky scream. There is intense fear and signs of autonomic
    arousal, such as mydriasis, tachycardia, rapid breathing, and sweating, during
    each episode. There is relative unresponsiveness to efforts of others to comfort
    the individual during the episodes.

B. No or little (e.g., only a single visual scene) dream imagery is recalled.
C. Amnesia for the episodes is present.
D. The episodes cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **261**

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication).
F. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the episodes of sleep-
walking or sleep terrors.

**Coding note:** For ICD-9-CM, code **307.46** for all subtypes. For ICD-10-CM, code is
based on subtype.

Specify whether:
**307.46 (F51.3) Sleepwalking type**
Specify if:
**With sleep-related eating
With sleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia)
307.46 (F51.4) Sleep terror type**

Criteria A, B, and C

NREM sleep arousal disorders are characterized by repeated episodes of incomplete
arousals from sleep, usually beginning during the first third of the major sleep epi-
sode. The individual may _sleepwalk_ (defined as repeated episodes of complex motor
behavior initiated during sleep, including rising from bed and walking about) or ex-
perience _sleep terrors_ (repeated occurrence of precipitous awakenings from sleep in
abrupt terror, usually beginning with a panicky scream). If the individual awakens af-
ter these arousals, little or none of the dream or only fragmentary, single images are
recalled and the person has amnesia for the episode.

Criteria D, E, and F

Consistent with other DSM-5 disorders, NREM sleep arousal disorders must be asso-
ciated with clinically significant distress or impairment. The physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) must be ruled out as a cause, as must
coexisting other mental disorders and medical conditions.

Nightmare Disorder

Nightmare disorder is characterized by recurrent dreams that feel threatening or
frightening or cause dysphoria. The person becomes fully oriented when awakened
and can usually remember the dream. Because nightmares are relatively common in
the general population, nightmare disorder should be considered only in cases where
the nightmares are recurrent and result in significant distress or impairment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Nightmare Disorder **307.47 (F51.5)**

A. Repeated occurrences of extended, extremely dysphoric, and well-remembered
dreams that usually involve efforts to avoid threats to survival, security, or physical
integrity and that generally occur during the second half of the major sleep episode.


**262** DSM-5 Guidebook

B. On awakening from the dysphoric dreams, the individual rapidly becomes oriented
and alert.
C. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The nightmare symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-
stance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).
E. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not adequately explain the predomi-
nant complaint of dysphoric dreams.
Specify if:
**During sleep onset**

Specify if:
**With associated non–sleep disorder,** including substance use disorders
**With associated other medical condition
With associated other sleep disorder
Coding note:** The code 307.47 (F51.5) applies to all three specifiers. Code
also the relevant associated mental disorder, medical condition, or other
sleep disorder immediately after the code for nightmare disorder in order
to indicate the association.

Specify if:
**Acute:** Duration of period of nightmares is 1 month or less.
**Subacute:** Duration of period of nightmares is greater than 1 month but less
than 6 months.
**Persistent:** Duration of period of nightmares is 6 months or greater.

Specify current severity:
Severity can be rated by the frequency with which the nightmares occur:
**Mild:** Less than one episode per week on average.
**Moderate:** One or more episodes per week but less than nightly.
**Severe:** Episodes nightly.

Criteria A and B

DSM-5 has replaced “repeated awakenings” with “repeated occurrences.” The change
removes the requirement that nightmares awaken the individual and thereby removes
the distinction made by some between nightmares (which cause awakenings) and bad
dreams (which do not). The distress due to nightmares extends beyond the disruptions
of nocturnal sleep that awakenings produce. First, up to 36% of chronic and 56% of
acute nightmare patients report not suffering from awakenings from sleep, whereas as
few as 11% claim that their nightmares always awaken them. Second, 69% of patients
with nightmare disorder report having had at least one (nonawakening) bad dream
whose emotional intensity is of equal or greater magnitude than that reported for their
nightmares. For 22% of individuals, mean intensity ratings for their bad dreams equal
or exceed mean intensity ratings for their nightmares (Hasler and Germain 2009).
Third, even the most unpleasant dreams do not necessarily awaken the sleeper; clini-
cians have described many individuals who dream of dying violently in their dreams


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **263**

without waking up. These findings together point to the existence of a substantial
group of individuals who have extremely intense, disturbing dreams that do not
awaken them. When nightmares terminate upon awakening, the person exhibits a
rapid return to full alertness. Dysphoria may persist into wakefulness and contribute to
difficulty returning to sleep and lasting daytime distress.
DSM-5 has also changed “extended and extremely frightening dreams, usually in-
volving threats to survival, security, or self-esteem” to “extended, extremely dys-
phoric, and well-remembered dreams that usually involve efforts to avoid threats to
survival, security, or physical integrity.” Fear may be the most common emotion char-
acterizing nightmares, but it is by no means the only one. Studies indicate that a variety
of dysphoric emotions occur in nightmares, including anger, sadness, frustration, dis-
gust, confusion, and guilt. In fact, 30% of nightmares and 51% of bad dreams contain
primary emotions other than fear (Nielsen and Zadra 2010)

Criterion C

Nightmares cause more significant subjective distress than demonstrable social or oc-
cupational impairment. If nightmares result in frequent awakenings or sleep avoid-
ance, however, individuals may experience excessive daytime sleepiness, poor
concentration, depression, anxiety, or irritability. Some individuals with nightmare
disorder minimize or underestimate the impact of nightmares on their functioning,
partly due to the lack of clear indicators of such impairments. This could lead to un-
derdiagnosis and undertreatment.

Criteria D and E

The nightmare symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-
stance. The term _attributable to_ more accurately reflects the fact that the precise causal-
ity of the nightmares is not known. Other mental disorders (e.g., panic disorder) and
medical conditions (e.g., nocturnal seizures) need to be ruled out as possible causes
of the dysphoric dreams. Bereavement may also be a cause of the dreams.

Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder

REM sleep behavior disorder in both human beings and animals is well established
and has the potential to cause dramatic and potentially violent or injurious behavior
arising from REM sleep. Seen in animal experiments in the 1960s, REM sleep behavior
disorder was first described in humans in 1986. Since then, it has been identified as
one of the major types of parasomnias, likely second only in prevalence to the NREM
sleep arousal disorders. The clinical features, polysomnographic findings (present in
nearly every case), and response to medication have been well characterized. REM
sleep behavior disorder is one of the most important causes of sleep-related injurious
or violent behavior.
The extraordinary relationship between REM sleep behavior disorder and neu-
rodegenerative disorders (particularly Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy
bodies, and multiple system atrophy) has been clearly established. At least 50% of in-


**264** DSM-5 Guidebook

dividuals with REM sleep behavior disorder presenting in sleep clinics will eventu-
ally (often with a delay of over 10 years) develop one of these conditions. REM sleep
behavior disorder may be more prevalent in psychiatric populations. In addition, iat-
rogenic REM sleep behavior disorder induced by medications commonly prescribed
by psychiatrists, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake in-
hibitors, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, is becoming increasingly
recognized.

Diagnostic Criteria for Rapid Eye Movement
Sleep Behavior Disorder **327.42 (G47.52)**

A. Repeated episodes of arousal during sleep associated with vocalization and/or com-
plex motor behaviors.
B. These behaviors arise during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and therefore usu-
ally occur more than 90 minutes after sleep onset, are more frequent during the
later portions of the sleep period, and uncommonly occur during daytime naps.
C. Upon awakening from these episodes, the individual is completely awake, alert,
and not confused or disoriented.
D. Either of the following:

1. REM sleep without atonia on polysomnographic recording.
2. A history suggestive of REM sleep behavior disorder and an established
    synucleinopathy diagnosis (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy).

E. The behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning (which may include injury to self or
the bed partner).
F. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
G. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the episodes.

Criteria A, B, C, and D

REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by repeated episodes of arousal, often
associated with vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors, during REM sleep.
These behaviors often reflect motor responses to the content of action-filled or violent
dreams and have been referred to as “dream-enacting behaviors.” These behaviors
may be very bothersome to the individual and the bed partner and can result in sig-
nificant injury (e.g., falling, jumping out of bed, punching, or kicking). These behav-
iors occur only during REM sleep. Upon awakening, the individual is immediately
alert and oriented and can usually recall the dream content. Further, either 1) REM sleep
without atonia on polysomnographic recording or 2) a history suggestive of REM
sleep behavior disorder and an established synucleinopathy diagnosis (e.g., Parkin-
son’s disease) is present.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **265**

Criteria E, F, and G

The diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder requires clinically significant distress
or impairment. The physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a med-
ication) or another medical condition must be ruled out as causing the disturbance,
and coexisting mental or medical disorders must have also been ruled out as a cause.

Restless Legs Syndrome

Restless legs syndrome is a sensorimotor, neurological sleep disorder characterized by a
desire to move the legs (or arms), usually associated with uncomfortable sensations typ-
ically described as creeping, crawling, tingling, burning, or itching. Symptoms are worse
when the individual is at rest, and frequent movements of the legs occur in an effort to
relieve the uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms are worse in the evening or night and in
some individuals occur only in the evening or night. In DSM-5, restless legs syndrome
has been elevated to disorder status. DSM-IV included a brief summary of restless legs
syndrome within the broader category of dyssomnia not otherwise specified.
Restless legs syndrome is common, with prevalence rates from 2.7% to 7.2% (the
lower rates reflecting the added requirement of at least moderate distress). Women
are 1.5–2 times more likely than men to have restless legs syndrome (Allen et al. 2005).
Restless legs syndrome is associated with significant clinical and functional im-
pairment. The disorder is well documented to be associated with reduced sleep time,
sleep fragmentation, and reports of more sleep disturbance. Objective studies dem-
onstrate significant, objective sleep abnormalities for individuals with restless legs
syndrome, with increased latency to sleep and higher arousal index as the most con-
sistent findings.

Diagnostic Criteria for Restless Legs Syndrome **333.94 (G25.81)**

A. An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by or in response to uncomfort-
able and unpleasant sensations in the legs, characterized by all of the following:

1. The urge to move the legs begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity.
2. The urge to move the legs is partially or totally relieved by movement.
3. The urge to move the legs is worse in the evening or at night than during the
    day, or occurs only in the evening or at night.

B. The symptoms in Criterion A occur at least three times per week and have per-
sisted for at least 3 months.
C. The symptoms in Criterion A are accompanied by significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other important
areas of functioning.
D. The symptoms in Criterion A are not attributable to another mental disorder or med-
ical condition (e.g., arthritis, leg edema, peripheral ischemia, leg cramps) and are not
better explained by a behavioral condition (e.g., positional discomfort, habitual foot
tapping).


**266** DSM-5 Guidebook

E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse
or medication (e.g., akathisia).

Criteria A and B

Criteria A and B are in line with the essential diagnostic features as defined in DSM-
IV and are compatible with descriptions in the literature. Urges to move the legs must
occur at least three times per week over a 3-month period to qualify for the diagnosis.
This helps ensure that the disorder is not simply a transient disturbance.

Criterion C

Restless legs syndrome must significantly affect functioning or cause distress. Al-
though the impact of milder symptoms is not well characterized, people may complain
of disruption in at least one activity of daily living, with half reporting a negative im-
pact on mood and nearly half reporting lack of energy. The most common conse-
quences of restless legs syndrome are sleep disturbances, including reduced sleep time
and sleep fragmentation.

Criteria D and E

Symptoms of restless legs syndrome cannot be solely accounted for by another mental
disorder or medical or behavioral condition or by medication effects. The differentia-
tion of restless legs syndrome from other conditions is important because many people
report some urge or need to move the legs while at rest and do not have the disorder.
The most important mimics of restless legs syndrome are leg cramps, positional dis-
comfort, arthralgias or arthritis, myalgias, positional ischemia (numbness), leg edema,
peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, and habitual foot tapping. Muscle “knots” or
cramps, relief with a single postural shift, limitation in joints, soreness on palpation,
and other abnormalities on physical examination are not characteristic of the syn-
drome. Worsening at night and periodic limb movements are more common in restless
legs syndrome than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Sleep Disorder

In DSM-5, substance- and medication-induced sleep disturbances are combined in a
single category. The essential feature of substance/medication-induced sleep disor-
der is a prominent sleep disturbance judged to be primarily associated with the
known effects of a substance of abuse or a medication. These disturbances are rela-
tively common in clinical settings but are not always straightforward to diagnose,
and they depend on several factors, including the type of substance (or medication),
the individual’s response to the agent, and the substance’s pharmacology. For exam-
ple, caffeine is one of the most common causes of disrupted sleep and needs to be
ruled out as a cause in any investigation of insomnia. Depending on the substance,


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **267**

one of four subtypes of sleep disturbance may be reported: insomnia type, daytime
sleepiness type, parasomnia type, and a mixed type for cases in which more than one
type of sleep disturbance is present and none predominates.
DSM-5 has included tobacco-induced sleep disorder in the list of diagnoses. Em-
pirical evidence indicates that nicotine may be a sleep-disturbing substance.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Sleep Disorder

A. A prominent and severe disturbance in sleep.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or after withdrawal from or exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
    Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sleep disorder that is not substance/
medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sleep disorder could in-
clude the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the ces-
sation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-in-
duced sleep disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-re-
lated episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/med-
ication]-induced sleep disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-
10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the
clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced
sleep disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder”).
If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-in-
duced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record
“moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending
on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid sub-
stance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th
position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced

sleep disorder. A moderate or severe tobacco use disorder is required in order to code
a tobacco-induced sleep disorder; it is not permissible to code a comorbid mild tobac-
co use disorder or no tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced sleep disorder.

Specify whether:
**Insomnia type:** Characterized by difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, fre-
quent nocturnal awakenings, or nonrestorative sleep.
**Daytime sleepiness type:** Characterized by predominant complaint of excessive
sleepiness/fatigue during waking hours or, less commonly, a long sleep period.
**Parasomnia type:** Characterized by abnormal behavioral events during sleep.
**Mixed type:** Characterized by a substance/medication-induced sleep problem
characterized by multiple types of sleep symptoms, but no symptom clearly pre-
dominates.

Criteria A and B

The criteria require that the sleep disturbance be severe. This limits the diagnosis to sleep
problems that merit independent clinical attention. The criteria further require that one
can attribute the sleep disturbance to the pharmacological effects of the substance.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **269**

Criterion C

Criterion C requires that the disturbance not be better accounted for by a sleep disor-
der that is not induced by a substance or medication. Evidence could include the fol-
lowing: 1) symptoms precede onset of the substance or medication use; 2) symptoms
persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute
withdrawal or severe intoxication; or 3) there is other evidence suggesting the exis-
tence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced sleep disorder (e.g., a his-
tory of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).

Criterion D

If the sleep disturbance occurs only during the course of a delirium, it should not war-
rant a separate diagnosis.

Criterion E

The sleep disturbance from the substance needs to result in clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment. Increased risk for relapse is one unique functional consequence
of this disorder.

Other Specified Insomnia Disorder and

Unspecified Insomnia Disorder

These are residual categories to use for symptoms of an insomnia disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment but do not meet criteria for a more spe-
cific disorder in the class. The category other specified insomnia disorder is used
when the clinician chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation does not
meet full criteria. The clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., brief
insomnia disorder).
The category unspecified insomnia disorder is used when the clinician chooses _not_
to specify the reason the criteria are not met, or there is insufficient information to
make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Insomnia Disorder **780.52 (G47.09)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of insomnia
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
insomnia disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class.
The other specified insomnia disorder category is used in situations in which the cli-
nician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not
meet the criteria for insomnia disorder or any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is
done by recording “other specified insomnia disorder” followed by the specific reason
(e.g., “brief insomnia disorder”).


**270** DSM-5 Guidebook

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Brief insomnia disorder:** Duration is less than 3 months.
2. **Restricted to nonrestorative sleep:** Predominant complaint is nonrestorative
    sleep unaccompanied by other sleep symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep or
    remaining asleep.

Unspecified Insomnia Disorder **780.52 (G47.00)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of insomnia
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
insomnia disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class.
The unspecified insomnia disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for insomnia disorder or
a specific sleep-wake disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Hypersomnolence Disorder

and Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder

These are residual categories to use for symptoms of a hypersomnolence disorder that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment but do not meet criteria for a more
specific disorder in the class. The category other specified hypersomnolence disorder
is used when the clinician chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation
does not meet full criteria. The clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason
(e.g., brief-duration hypersomnolence).
The category unspecified hypersomnolence disorder is used when the clinician
chooses _not_ to specify the reason the criteria are not met, or there is insufficient infor-
mation to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Hypersomnolence
Disorder **780.54 (G47.19)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of hypersom-
nolence disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake dis-
orders diagnostic class. The other specified hypersomnolence disorder category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **271**

that the presentation does not meet the criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any
specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by recording “other specified hypersomno-
lence disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “brief-duration hypersomnolence,”
as in Kleine-Levin syndrome).

Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder **780.54 (G47.10)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of hypersom-
nolence disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake dis-
orders diagnostic class. The unspecified hypersomnolence disorder category is used
in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria
are not met for hypersomnolence disorder or a specific sleep-wake disorder, and in-
cludes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis.

Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder and

Unspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder

The other specified sleep-wake disorder category applies in situations in which symp-
toms characteristic of a sleep-wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
functional impairment predominate but do not meet full criteria for any of the disor-
ders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class, and do not qualify for a diagnosis of
other specified insomnia disorder or other specified hypersomnolence disorder.
The unspecified sleep-wake disorder category applies in situations in which the cli-
nician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sleep-
wake disorder, or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder **780.59 (G47.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sleep-
wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do
not qualify for a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or other specified hy-
persomnolence disorder. The other specified sleep-wake disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done
by recording “other specified sleep-wake disorder” followed by the specific reason


**272** DSM-5 Guidebook

(e.g., “repeated arousals during rapid eye movement sleep without polysomnography
or history of Parkinson’s disease or other synucleinopathy”).

Unspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder **780.59 (G47.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sleep-
wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do
not qualify for a diagnosis of unspecified insomnia disorder or unspecified hypersom-
nolence disorder. The unspecified sleep-wake disorder category is used in situations
in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for
a specific sleep-wake disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

- The revision of the sleep disorders chapter for DSM-5 has been influenced by
    the second edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, pub-
    lished by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
- The diagnosis primary insomnia has been renamed insomnia disorder to avoid
    the differentiation between primary and secondary insomnia. Narcolepsy—now
    known to be associated with hypocretin—is distinguished from other forms of
    hypersomnolence (hypersomnolence disorder).
- Breathing-related sleep disorders are divided into three distinct disorders: obstruc-
    tive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventi-
    lation.
- The subtypes of circadian rhythm sleep disorders (now called circadian rhythm
    sleep-wake disorders) have been expanded to include advanced sleep phase
    type and irregular sleep-wake type, and the jet lag type has been omitted.
- Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and restless legs syndrome have
    achieved independent disorder status. Both were included in DSM-IV as exam-
    ples of a “not otherwise specified” diagnosis.

**274** DSM-5 Guidebook

DSM-5 includes separate chapters for sexual dysfunctions,
gender dysphoria, and paraphilic disorders. _Sexual dysfunctions_ are disorders charac-
terized by a disturbance in a person’s ability to respond sexually or to experience sex-
ual pleasure. _Gender dysphoria_ refers to a person’s affective/cognitive discontent with
the assigned gender. _Paraphilic disorders_ involve sexual preferences other than genital
stimulation or preparatory fondling. DSM classification of these disorders has varied
over the years, reflecting the growing knowledge about the disorders as well as the
greater concern that individuals, clinicians, and researchers have about them.
Sexual dysfunctions were first recognized in DSM-II within the diagnosis “psycho-
physiologic genito-urinary disorder,” which included problems such as “disturbances
of menstruation and micturition, dyspareunia, and impotence in which emotional fac-
tors play a causative role” (p. 47). Their attribution to “emotional factors” reflected the
thinking at the time, which minimized the role of a physical etiology for these disorders.
In DSM-III, sexual dysfunctions came into their own and were placed in the umbrella
chapter “Psychosexual Disorders,” which also included gender identity disorders and
paraphilias.
Whereas the gender identity disorders were first recognized in DSM-III, paraphil-
ias were first listed in DSM-I under “sexual deviation,” a subcategory of sociopathic
personality disturbance. DSM-I stated the following: “This diagnosis is reserved for
deviant sexuality which is not symptomatic of more extensive syndromes, such as
schizophrenic and obsessional reactions. The term includes most of the cases formerly
classified as ‘psychopathic personality with pathologic sexuality.’ The diagnosis will
specify the type of the pathologic behavior, such as homosexuality, transvestism, pe-
dophilia, fetishism and sexual sadism (including rape, sexual assault, mutilation)”
(pp. 38–39).
In DSM-II, the paraphilias continued to be grouped within the category of person-
ality disorders and certain other nonpsychotic mental disorders, but a more complete
listing of sexual deviations was created that resembles the current classification, with
the exception of homosexuality, which was deleted from DSM in 1973 by vote of the
American Psychiatric Association (APA) Board of Trustees. DSM-III introduced oper-
ational diagnostic criteria for the paraphilias and included ego-dystonic homosexual-
ity under the subcategory of other psychosexual disorders. It was finally deleted from
DSM-III-R, although “persistent and marked distress” about one’s sexual orientation
continued in DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and DSM-IV-TR as an example of a sexual disorder
not otherwise specified. This concern is no longer acknowledged in DSM-5, reflecting
the evolving views of the psychiatric field and society at large.
During DSM-5 deliberations, there was some controversy about the possibility of
including hypersexual disorder, which is characterized by sexual behavior that is ex-
cessive or poorly controlled (commonly referred to as either “sex addiction” or “com-
pulsive sexual behavior”), and paraphilic coercive disorder, which consists of a
sexual preference for coerced sexual activity (i.e., rape). After considerable discussion
and input from fellow APA members, the decision was made not to include these dis-
orders in DSM-5.
Sexual dysfunctions, gender dysphoria, and paraphilic disorders will be dis-
cussed in turn, beginning with the sexual dysfunctions.


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **275**

SEXUAL DYSFUNCTIONS

Sexual dysfunction involves either a disturbance in the processes that characterize the
sexual response cycle or pain or discomfort associated with sexual intercourse (see
list of disorders in Table 14–1). Epidemiological data suggest that sexual dysfunctions
are frequent and occur in 10%–30% of adults. Especially common are premature
(early) ejaculation, female orgasmic disorder, and erectile disorder. The sexual re-
sponse cycle has four phases—sexual excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.

```
The first phase, _sexual excitement,_ consists of muscle tension, changes in breathing
and heart rate, swelling of the genitals, and vaginal lubrication. This phase may last
from a few minutes to a few hours. The second phase, the _plateau_ phase, intensifies
the feelings of the first phase and extends to the point of orgasm. The physiological
responses during the plateau phase become more intense. Several DSM-5 disorders
correspond to these first two phases. These include male hypoactive sexual desire dis-
order, female sexual interest/arousal disorder, and erectile disorder. Several changes
have been made for DSM-5. First, the DSM-IV categories hypoactive sexual desire dis-
order (as it relates to females) and female sexual arousal disorder have been merged
into a single category: female sexual interest/arousal disorder. Second, in DSM-5, hy-
poactive sexual desire disorder is now specifically focused on men and has been re-
named male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Third, sexual aversion disorder has
been eliminated.
_Orgasm,_ the third phase of the sexual response cycle, is the shortest phase and may
last only a few seconds or minutes. This phase consists of a release of sexual tension,
ejaculation of semen, and vaginal contractions. DSM-5 disorders corresponding to this
phase include female orgasmic disorder, delayed ejaculation, and premature (early)
ejaculation. The DSM-IV disorders male orgasmic disorder and premature ejacula-
tion have been replaced by delayed ejaculation and premature (early) ejaculation, re-
spectively.


**276** DSM-5 Guidebook

During _resolution,_ the final stage of the sexual response cycle, the body slowly re-
turns to normal, with swelling and erection resolving, and a sense of well-being oc-
curring. No DSM-5 disorders correspond to this phase.
In addition to disorders associated with the sexual response cycle, DSM-5 includes
genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, which involves experiencing physical pain
or discomfort during sexual intercourse. Having a single disorder referring to pain or
discomfort reflects a change from DSM-IV, in which two specific pain disorders—
dyspareunia and vaginismus—were included. DSM-5 has also expanded the previ-
ous category of substance-induced sexual dysfunction to include medication (sub-
stance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction).
DSM-5 criteria for the sexual dysfunctions have several elements in common. Cri-
terion A describes the disorder, Criteria B–D are the same for all disorders (except
substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, which has an additional crite-
rion), and the subtypes and specifiers are identical for most disorders (with some
variation for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and for substance/medication-
induced sexual dysfunction). In addition, the sexual dysfunction category includes an
other specified and an unspecified disorder to account for symptoms that do not meet
the full criteria for any of the disorders in the diagnostic class. These replace the DSM-
IV “not otherwise specified” categories.
To avoid redundancy, the criteria for delayed ejaculation are presented as an ex-
ample, and readers are referred to DSM-5 for the specific criteria for the other sexual
dysfunctions. Because occasional sexual dysfunction is an inherent part of human
sexuality and not indicative of a disorder, only symptoms that persist are considered
for purposes of a diagnosis.

Sexual Dysfunction

Diagnostic Criteria for Delayed Ejaculation **302.74 (F52.32)**

A. Either of the following symptoms must be experienced on almost all or all occasions
(approximately 75%–100%) of partnered sexual activity (in identified situational con-
texts or, if generalized, in all contexts), and without the individual desiring delay:

1. Marked delay in ejaculation.
2. Marked infrequency or absence of ejaculation.

B. The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of approxi-
mately 6 months.
C. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in the individual.
D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a
consequence of severe relationship distress or other significant stressors and is not at-
tributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition.

Specify whether:
**Lifelong:** The disturbance has been present since the individual became sexually
active.
**Acquired:** The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal sexual function.


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **277**

Specify whether:
**Generalized:** Not limited to certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners.
**Situational:** Only occurs with certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.
**Moderate:** Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.
**Severe:** Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

Criterion A

This item describes the symptoms of sexual dysfunction and establishes the fre-
quency for the symptoms. In most cases, the symptoms must be experienced on ap-
proximately 75%–100% of all occasions of sexual activity. This reflects a change from
DSM-IV, which stated that the sexual dysfunction had to be “persistent and recurrent,”
providing the clinician with little guidance to evaluating symptom frequency. This
criterion also prevents the overdiagnosis of a sexual dysfunction.

Criterion B

This item establishes the minimum duration of symptoms required for diagnosis with
the sexual dysfunction. In most cases, the symptoms need to be present for a mini-
mum duration of approximately 6 months.

Criterion C

This item states that the symptoms of sexual dysfunction “cause clinically significant
distress.” This criterion, like the first two, differentiates sexual dysfunctions from
temporary difficulties with sexual functioning that are part of everyday life. The clin-
ically significant distress may take the form of social isolation, depression, and poor
self-esteem. Impairment from sexual dysfunction may include unstable relationships,
lack of dating, and abuse of substances to help cope. Criterion C reflects a change
from DSM-IV’s Criterion B, which stated, “the disturbance causes marked distress or
interpersonal difficulty.” The phrases “marked distress” and “interpersonal difficulty”
have been variously interpreted by clinicians and researchers, and the new language
provides greater clarity.

Criterion D

Other disorders or behaviors that could possibly exhibit themselves as a sexual dys-
function must be excluded. In DSM-IV, only substances and general medical condi-
tions were excluded. In DSM-5, the exclusions have been expanded to include distress
from a relationship and other stressors. For example, when a man is experiencing a
contentious divorce and reports low sexual desire only during the time of the ex-
tended proceedings, the diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would
not be appropriate.


**278** DSM-5 Guidebook

Subtypes and Specifiers

DSM-5 provides subtypes and specifiers for each of the sexual dysfunctions. Although
the subtypes are carried over from DSM-IV, the specifiers have been expanded to more
accurately reflect the variety of factors that can impact sexual functioning.
The lifelong and acquired subtypes apply to the onset of the sexual dysfunction.
_Lifelong_ refers to the failure to develop normal sexual functioning from first sexual ex-
periences, whereas _acquired_ refers to situations in which the person develops sexual
disorders after a period of relatively normal functioning.
The generalized and situational subtypes have also been carried over. _Generalized_
refers to sexual difficulties that are not limited to certain situations, partners, or types
of stimulation. _Situational_ refers to sexual difficulties that only occur with particular
partners, in certain situations, or with certain types of stimulation.
Current severity specifiers are provided to rate each disorder as mild (evidence of
mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A), moderate (evidence of moderate dis-
tress over the symptoms in Criterion A), or severe (evidence of severe or extreme dis-
tress over the symptoms in Criterion A).

Delayed Ejaculation

Delayed ejaculation applies when a man has a marked delay in or marked infrequency
or absence of orgasm. For some men, only certain types of stimulation lead to orgasm.
Others may experience an orgasm but only after prolonged and intense sexual activity
or stimulation.
Delayed ejaculation is the new name for DSM-IV male orgasmic disorder. The name
change reflects current terminology in the field. Given that men’s experiences of sex-
ual excitement are not uniform, the phrase “following a normal sexual excitement
phase” was eliminated from the diagnostic criteria.

Erectile Disorder

Erectile disorder applies to situations when a man is unable to attain or maintain an
adequate erection (Segraves 2010). This can happen at the outset of or during a sexual
encounter. Erectile disorder can interfere with fertility and produce low self-esteem.
In addition to the general changes for the overall category of sexual dysfunctions,
the diagnosis of erectile disorder underwent several changes in DSM-5. Whereas DSM-
IV stated that the disorder was defined as an “inability to attain, or to maintain until
completion of the sexual activity, an adequate erection,” DSM-5 requires one of three
possible symptoms: marked difficulty in obtaining an erection during sexual activity,
marked difficulty in maintaining an erection until completion of sexual activity, or
marked decrease in erectile rigidity.

Female Orgasmic Disorder

Female orgasmic disorder involves recurrent delay in, marked infrequency of, or ab-
sence of orgasm, or markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations. Women dem-


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **279**

onstrate wide variability in the type and intensity of stimulation needed for orgasm.
For this reason, the diagnosis requires that the symptoms are experienced on almost
all occasions of sexual activity.
DSM-5 includes three important changes to female orgasmic disorder. “Marked in-
frequency” of orgasms and “reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations” have been
added as symptoms, either of which can fulfill the diagnosis. The addition of “mark-
edly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations” reflects the fact that orgasm is not an
“all or nothing” phenomenon and that diminished intensity of orgasm may be a prob-
lem for some women. In addition, in DSM-5, the phrase “following a normal sexual ex-
citement phase” has been deleted because a woman’s experience of sexual excitement
is not uniform, there is good evidence of substantial variability, and none of the prev-
alence studies have assessed what constitutes a “normal sexual excitement phase.”

Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder

In DSM-5, aspects of both hypoactive sexual desire disorder and female sexual
arousal disorder have been combined to create female sexual interest/arousal disor-
der. The diagnosis applies when a woman has either a lack of interest in sexual activ-
ity or an inability to attain or maintain arousal.
The name change reflects the common experience that desire and (at least subjec-
tive) arousal highly overlap. In some women, desire precedes arousal; in other women,
desire follows arousal. There are inconsistencies in how desire is defined, with some
definitions focusing on sexual behavior as an indicator of desire, others focusing on
spontaneous sexual thoughts and fantasies, and still others emphasizing the respon-
sive nature of women’s desire. The word _desire_ in DSM-IV hypoactive sexual desire
disorder has been changed to _interest_ because _desire_ connotes a deficiency and often
implies a biological urge. The phrase “an adequate lubrication-swelling response of
sexual excitement” in DSM-IV female sexual arousal disorder has been eliminated be-
cause evidence suggests that increases in vaginal blood flow during exposure to sex-
ual stimuli may be a relatively “automatic response,” and one that women may or
may not be aware of. Furthermore, there is little evidence that women with a sexual
arousal disorder have impaired genital response; lubrication may or may not co-occur
with subjective arousal. Finally, there is evidence that women report a wide range of
nongenital and genital changes, and it is unclear how common the “lubrication-swell-
ing response” is.

Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder

Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder applies when a person has pain or discom-
fort, muscular tightening, or fear or anxiety about pain when having sexual inter-
course. This disorder reflects a change from DSM-IV, in which two distinct disor-
ders—dyspareunia and vaginismus—were used to diagnose sexual pain disorders,
both now subsumed within this new category. Dyspareunia and vaginismus were un-
reliable diagnoses, and it was difficult for clinicians to distinguish between them. The
new category will correct that situation, yet allow for the diagnosis of pain and pen-


**280** DSM-5 Guidebook

etration disorders. This will also provide a framework to facilitate clinician evalua-
tion, diagnosis, and referral.

Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder

Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder applies when a man has diminished desire for
sexual activity and few if any sexual thoughts or fantasies (Brotto 2010). Because DSM-
5 has a new diagnosis for low sexual desire and arousal problems in women (i.e., female
sexual interest/arousal disorder), male hypoactive sexual desire disorder was created
to enable a clinician to diagnose a man’s diminished sexual desire. Other than the gen-
eral changes to the category of sexual dysfunction in DSM-5, as stated earlier in this
chapter, the criteria for male hypoactive sexual desire disorder are essentially un-
changed from DSM-IV.

Premature (Early) Ejaculation

Early ejaculation is a condition in which a man ejaculates “during partnered sexual
activity within approximately 1 minute following vaginal penetration and before the
individual wishes it.” Early ejaculation is more common in novel sexual situations
and in men who have had a substantial interval since last orgasm.
The definition of early ejaculation has been operationalized by the use of “approx-
imately 1 minute” as the amount of time after initiation of sexual activity that ejacu-
lation occurs.
DSM-5 notes that premature (early) ejaculation can occur during nonvaginal sex-
ual activities, but that specific duration criteria have not been established and thus are
not included.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Sexual Dysfunction

Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction applies when a clinically signifi-
cant sexual dysfunction develops during or soon after substance intoxication or with-
drawal or exposure to a medication, and the substance/medication is capable of pro-
ducing the symptoms. Acute intoxication with or chronic abuse of various substances
(e.g., alcohol, nicotine, opiates, sedatives) may result in sexual dysfunction. In addition,
many medications (e.g., antihypertensives, antidepressants, antipsychotics) may cause
a decrease in sexual interest and result in sexual performance difficulties.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Sexual Dysfunction

A. A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is predominant in the clinical pic-
ture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction that is not sub-
stance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction
could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the ces-
sation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced
sexual dysfunction (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related
episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the individual.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/med-
ication]-induced sexual dysfunctions are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use dis-
order present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is co-
morbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is
“1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the sub-
stance-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-in-
duced sexual dysfunction”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is
comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is
“2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe
[substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use
disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy
use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should
record only the substance-induced sexual dysfunction.


**282** DSM-5 Guidebook

Specify if (see Table 16–1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders”
for diagnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
**With onset during withdrawal:** If criteria are met for withdrawal from the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.
**With onset after medication use:** Symptoms may appear either at initiation of
medication or after a modification or change in use.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Occurs on 25%–50% of occasions of sexual activity.
**Moderate:** Occurs on 50%–75% of occasions of sexual activity.

The DSM-5 criteria state that the dysfunction has to have started during or soon
after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. These
criteria reflect a change from DSM-IV, which failed to account for changes in dosage
increase and discontinuation being potential causes of the sexual dysfunction.

Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction and

Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction

Sexual dysfunctions that do not meet criteria for any specific sexual dysfunction are
classified as other specified or unspecified sexual dysfunction. The “other specified”
diagnosis is appropriate when the clinician has concluded that a sexual dysfunction is
present but does not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders. In this instance the
clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason the presentation does not meet
the criteria (e.g., by specifying “sexual aversion”). The category unspecified sexual
dysfunction applies when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present but the clini-
cian chooses not to specify why the criteria are not met for a specific disorder. It may


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **283**

also be used when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis
of a sexual dysfunction.

GENDER DYSPHORIA

_Gender dysphoria_ refers to the distress that may accompany the mismatch between one’s
assigned gender and how a person perceives their true gender. The DSM classifications
of this disorder reflect the tension within the field as to how best to conceptualize the
disorder. In DSM-III, transsexualism and gender identity disorder of childhood were
introduced, both placed in the chapter titled “Psychosexual Disorders.” In DSM-III-R,
both disorders were moved to the chapter titled “Disorders First Evident in Infancy,
Childhood, or Adolescence.” Also included was the diagnosis gender identity disorder
of adolescence or adulthood, nontranssexual type, for cross-gender-identified individ-
uals who did not pursue sex reassignment. DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR included only one
specific diagnosis, gender identity disorder, along with gender identity disorder not
otherwise specified, in the chapter titled “Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders.” Al-
though the DSM terminology and categorization of gender identity disorders have var-
ied over time, the fundamental nature of the disorder—distress about one’s assigned
gender—remains a consistent and unifying feature. Table 14–2 lists the DSM-5 gender
dysphoria diagnoses.

**TABLE 14–2. DSM-5 gender dysphoria**

Gender Dysphoria in Children

Gender dysphoria is characterized by marked incongruence between the person’s as-
signed gender and their expressed gender.
In response to criticisms that the term _gender identity disorder_ was stigmatizing, it
has been renamed _gender dysphoria_ in DSM-5. In addition, subtypes pertaining to sex-
ual attraction were eliminated, and a new subtype categorization that recognizes indi-
viduals with a medical disorder of sex development was introduced.

Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Dysphoria in Children **302.6 (F64.2)**

A. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and as-
signed gender, of at least 6 months’ duration, as manifested by at least six of the
following (one of which must be Criterion A1):

1. A strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that one is the other
    gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender).


**284** DSM-5 Guidebook

2. In boys (assigned gender), a strong preference for cross-dressing or simulating
    female attire; or in girls (assigned gender), a strong preference for wearing only
    typical masculine clothing and a strong resistance to the wearing of typical fem-
    inine clothing.
3. A strong preference for cross-gender roles in make-believe play or fantasy play.
4. A strong preference for the toys, games, or activities stereotypically used or en-
    gaged in by the other gender.
5. A strong preference for playmates of the other gender.
6. In boys (assigned gender), a strong rejection of typically masculine toys,
    games, and activities and a strong avoidance of rough-and-tumble play; or in
    girls (assigned gender), a strong rejection of typically feminine toys, games,
    and activities.
7. A strong dislike of one’s sexual anatomy.
8. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics that match
    one’s experienced gender.

B. The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in so-
cial, school, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**With a disorder of sex development** (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder
such as 255.2 [E25.0] congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 259.50 [E34.50] androgen
insensitivity syndrome).
**Coding note:** Code the disorder of sex development as well as gender dysphoria.

Criterion A

Because some degree of cross-gender identification is not pathological, DSM-5 has
eliminated the DSM-IV wording “strong and persistent” and instead introduced a
minimum duration requirement of 6 months and raised the threshold from four to six
indicators of “marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and
assigned gender.” These changes reflect the intensity and duration of cross-gender
identification and help avoid the problem of overdiagnosis.

Criterion B

The condition causes clinically significant distress or impairment. In children, this may
include problems in school performance, refusal to attend school (where they may be
exposed to taunts and bullying), social isolation, and depression. They may feel that
no one understands them and that they do not fit in with other children.

Specifiers

The specifiers have replaced DSM-IV Criterion C, which stated, “The disturbance is not
concurrent with a physical intersex condition.” A specifier has been added: “with a dis-
order of sex development” (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder such as congenital
adrenal hyperplasia or androgen insensitivity syndrome). Gender dysphoria is com-
mon in individuals with and without intersex conditions, now referred to as _disorders of
sex development._


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **285**

Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults

The diagnosis of gender dysphoria requires discomfort with one’s own assigned gen-
der and clinically significant distress or impairment. In adolescents and adults, the
disturbance is manifested by symptoms such as stated desire to be of the other gen-
der, frequent passing as the other gender, desire to live as the other gender, and the
conviction that the person has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender.

Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Dysphoria in
Adolescents and Adults **302.85 (F64.1)**

A. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and as-
signed gender, of at least 6 months’ duration, as manifested by at least two of the
following:

1. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and pri-
    mary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or in young adolescents, the antic-
    ipated secondary sex characteristics).
2. A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
because of a marked incongruence with one’s experienced/expressed gender
(or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated
secondary sex characteristics).
3. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the oth-
er gender.
4. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different
from one’s assigned gender).
5. A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender
different from one’s assigned gender).
6. A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other
gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender).

B. The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in so-
cial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**With a disorder of sex development** (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder
such as 255.2 [E25.0] congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 259.50 [E34.50] androgen
insensitivity syndrome).
**Coding note:** Code the disorder of sex development as well as gender dysphoria.

Specify if:
**Posttransition:** The individual has transitioned to full-time living in the desired
gender (with or without legalization of gender change) and has undergone (or is
preparing to have) at least one cross-sex medical procedure or treatment regi-
men—namely, regular cross-sex hormone treatment or gender reassignment sur-
gery confirming the desired gender (e.g., penectomy, vaginoplasty in a natal male;
mastectomy or phalloplasty in a natal female).


**286** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion A

The focus is on the discrepancy between experienced or expressed gender (which can
be either male, female, in between, or otherwise) and assigned gender (in most so-
cieties male or female) rather than cross-gender identification and same-gender
aversion. For the adult criteria, DSM-5 requires at least two of six indicators of the
condition.

Criterion B

The condition causes clinically significant distress or impairment. Adolescents and
adults with gender dysphoria may become socially isolated, abuse alcohol or other
drugs to cope, and have difficulties with work or interpersonal relationships.

Specifiers

Two specifiers have replaced the DSM-IV criterion “The disturbance is not concurrent
with a physical intersex condition.” First, the specifier “with a disorder of sex devel-
opment” (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder such as congenital adrenal hyper-
plasia or androgen insensitivity syndrome) has been added to further describe the
gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is common in individuals with and without in-
tersex conditions, now referred to as _disorders of sex development._ Second, “posttransi-
tion” has been added as the other specifier. This addition was prompted by the
observation that for many individuals, after transition, no criteria for gender dyspho-
ria are met, but they continue to undergo chronic hormone treatment, further gender-
confirming surgery, or intermittent psychotherapy or counseling to facilitate adapta-
tion to life in the desired gender and the social consequences of the transition. The
concept of posttransition is modeled on the concept “in partial or full remission,” which
is used for mood disorders.

Other Specified Gender Dysphoria and

Unspecified Gender Dysphoria

These diagnostic categories apply to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of gender dysphoria that cause significant distress or functional impairment predom-
inate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria. The other specified cate-
gory is used when the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria. The unspecified cate-
gory is used when the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are
not met for gender dysphoria, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

PARAPHILIC DISORDERS

Paraphilic disorders are characterized by intense and persistent sexual interest other
than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with mature con-
senting humans.


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **287**

The paraphilias have been recognized for centuries. In terms of formal classifica-
tion, paraphilias were recognized in DSM-I and DSM-II as a form of personality dis-
turbance, but in DSM-III they were placed in the chapter “Psychosexual Disorders”
and diagnostic criteria were developed. The paraphilias continued relatively un-
changed through subsequent editions, included in chapters containing the sexual dys-
functions (and gender identity disorder in DSM-IV). In DSM-5, paraphilic disorders
have their own chapter.
Because not all paraphilias are considered mental disorders, DSM-5 makes a dis-
tinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders. A paraphilic disorder diagno-
sis requires that a paraphilia cause distress or impairment to the individual, or entail
personal harm, or risk of harm, to others. A paraphilia is a necessary but not a suffi-
cient condition for having a paraphilic disorder. Having a paraphilia does not in and
of itself automatically justify or require clinical intervention.
In the diagnostic criteria set for each of the listed paraphilic disorders, Criterion A
specifies the qualitative nature of the paraphilia (e.g., cross-dressing) and Criterion B
specifies the negative consequences of the paraphilia (significant distress or impair-
ment in important areas of functioning).
Course specifiers have been added for each of the paraphilic disorders, allowing
for the documentation of changes in an individual’s status. “In a controlled environ-
ment” is included because the propensity of an individual to act on paraphilic urges
may be more difficult to assess objectively when the individual has no opportunity to
act on such urges. “In full remission” indicates that the individual has not acted on
the urges with a nonconsenting person and/or has had no distress or impairment in
functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.
DSM-5 includes 10 paraphilic disorders, as listed in Table 14–3. Each is discussed
in turn, and changes from DSM-IV are highlighted.

Voyeuristic Disorder

Voyeuristic disorder is defined by the act of observing an unsuspecting person(s) who
is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaged in sexual activity. The individual has


**288** DSM-5 Guidebook

acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fan-
tasies have resulted in clinically significant distress or functional impairment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Voyeuristic Disorder **302.82 (F65.3)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from ob-
serving an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or en-
gaging in sexual activity, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or
the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The individual experiencing the arousal and/or acting on the urges is at least 18 years
of age.

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in voyeuristic
behavior are restricted.
**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting
person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Exhibitionistic Disorder

Exhibitionistic disorder is defined by the exposure of one’s genitalia to an unsuspect-
ing individual, with the additional requirement that the person has acted on these
sexual urges with a nonconsenting person or the sexual urges or fantasies have re-
sulted in clinically significant distress or functional impairment.
In addition to the overall changes to the paraphilic disorders in DSM-5, specifiers
have been added for exhibitionistic disorder regarding the age of the unsuspecting in-
dividuals.

Diagnostic Criteria for Exhibitionistic Disorder **302.4 (F65.2)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the
exposure of one’s genitals to an unsuspecting person, as manifested by fantasies,
urges, or behaviors.
B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or
the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

stricted.
**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting
person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Frotteuristic Disorder

Frotteuristic disorder involves sexual arousal from touching or rubbing against a
nonconsenting person. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a noncon-
senting person, or the individual’s sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically signifi-
cant distress or functional impairment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Frotteuristic Disorder **302.89 (F65.81)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from
touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as manifested by fantasies,
urges, or behaviors.
B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or
the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to touch or rub against a
nonconsenting person are restricted.
**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting
person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Sexual Masochism Disorder

Sexual masochism disorder involves the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or
otherwise made to suffer. The fantasies, urges, or behaviors need to also result in clin-
ically significant distress or functional impairment.
In DSM-5, the unique specifier regarding asphyxiophilia has been added because
of the high rates of mortality associated with the behavior.


**290** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Sexual Masochism Disorder **302.83 (F65.51)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the
act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, as manifested
by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**With asphyxiophilia:** If the individual engages in the practice of achieving sexual
arousal related to restriction of breathing.

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in masochistic
sexual behaviors are restricted.
**In full remission:** There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Sexual Sadism Disorder

Sexual sadism disorder involves acts in which the person recurrently derives intense
sexual arousal from the physical or psychological suffering of another person. For the
behavior to merit a disorder, however, the individual has to have acted on these sex-
ual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies must cause
clinically significant distress or functional impairment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Sexual Sadism Disorder **302.84 (F65.52)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the
physical or psychological suffering of another person, as manifested by fantasies,
urges, or behaviors.
B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the
sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in sadistic sex-
ual behaviors are restricted.
**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting
person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **291**

Pedophilic Disorder

Pedophilic disorder is defined by sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviors
involving sexual activities with a prepubescent child (generally age 13 years or
younger). Some individuals with this disorder are only attracted to children, whereas
others are also attracted to adults. For the criteria for pedophilic disorder to be met,
however, the individual has to have acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges
or fantasies must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. The individual
must be at least 16 years old and at least 5 years older than the child to whom the fan-
tasies or behavior is directed.
DSM-5 has included unique specifiers to designate whether the individual is also
attracted to adults, which gender the individual is attracted to, and whether the at-
traction is only to family members (incest).

Diagnostic Criteria for Pedophilic Disorder **302.2 (F65.4)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies,
sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or chil-
dren (generally age 13 years or younger).
B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies
cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.
C. The individual is at least age 16 years and at least 5 years older than the child or
children in Criterion A.
**Note:** Do not include an individual in late adolescence involved in an ongoing sex-
ual relationship with a 12- or 13-year-old.
Specify whether:
**Exclusive type** (attracted only to children)
**Nonexclusive type**

Specify if:
**Sexually attracted to males
Sexually attracted to females
Sexually attracted to both**

Specify if:
**Limited to incest**

Fetishistic Disorder

Fetishistic disorder involves the use of nonliving objects, such as underwear or shoes,
or a highly specific focus on a nongenital body part(s) for sexual arousal. For the be-
havior to merit a diagnosis, however, the fantasies, urges, or behaviors need to result
in clinically significant distress or functional impairment.
Criterion C reflects the need to distinguish fetishistic disorder from transvestic
disorder. In DSM-5, a unique specifier has been added that details the object of the fe-
tish (e.g., body part[s]).


**292** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Fetishistic Disorder **302.81 (F65.0)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from either
the use of nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on nongenital body part(s), as
manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The fetish objects are not limited to articles of clothing used in cross-dressing (as
in transvestic disorder) or devices specifically designed for the purpose of tactile
genital stimulation (e.g., vibrator).

Specify:
**Body part(s)
Nonliving object(s)
Other**

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in fetishistic
behaviors are restricted.
**In full remission:** There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupation-
al, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled envi-
ronment.

Transvestic Disorder

Transvestic disorder is characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from
cross-dressing. In addition, the urges, fantasies, or behavior causes the person clini-
cally significant distress or functional impairment.
The name has changed from transvestic fetishism to transvestic disorder. DSM-5
does not include Criterion C from the DSM-IV criteria, which stated that the cross-
dressing could not occur exclusively during the course of gender identity disorder. In
addition, DSM-5 has removed the requirement that the disorder only be diagnosed in
heterosexual males. Unique specifiers have been added to the DSM-5 criteria regard-
ing whether the objects are the main driving force or whether the individual imagines
himself as the female.

Diagnostic Criteria for Transvestic Disorder **302.3 (F65.1)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from
cross-dressing, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.


**_Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders_** **293**

Specify if:
**With fetishism:** If sexually aroused by fabrics, materials, or garments.
**With autogynephilia:** If sexually aroused by thoughts or images of self as female.

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to cross-dress are re-
stricted.
**In full remission:** There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupation-
al, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled envi-
ronment.

Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder and

Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder

Other specified and unspecified paraphilic disorders are residual categories that re-
place DSM-IV’s paraphilia not otherwise specified. The former is a category for para-
philic disorders that cause distress or impairment but do not meet the full criteria for
any of the specific paraphilic disorders. It is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the reason (e.g., zoophilia). The category unspecified para-
philic disorder is used when the paraphilic disorder causes distress or impairment but
does not meet the full criteria for any of the specific paraphilic disorders and the clini-
cian chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met, and includes pre-
sentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder **302.89 (F65.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a paraphilic
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the paraphilic disorders diagnostic class. The other specified paraphilic
disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the
specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific paraphilic
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified paraphilic disorder” followed by the
specific reason (e.g., “zoophilia”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include, but are not limited to, recurrent and intense sexual arousal involving
telephone scatologia (obscene phone calls), necrophilia (corpses), zoophilia (animals),
coprophilia (feces), klismaphilia (enemas), or urophilia (urine) that has been present for
at least 6 months and causes marked distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning. Other specified paraphilic disorder can be spec-
ified as in remission and/or as occurring in a controlled environment.


**294** DSM-5 Guidebook

Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder **302.9 (F65.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a paraphilic
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the paraphilic disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified paraphilic dis-
order category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason
that the criteria are not met for a specific paraphilic disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

- Each of the three classes of disorders discussed in this chapter—sexual dys-
    functions, gender dysphoria, and paraphilic disorders—has its own chapter in
    DSM-5, rather than all being grouped together as in DSM-IV.
- The DSM-IV categories hypoactive sexual desire disorder (as it relates to fe-
    males) and female sexual arousal disorder are now combined into a single disor-
    der: female sexual interest/arousal disorder. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder
    as it relates to men is now called male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Sexual
    aversion disorder has been eliminated.
- Gender identity disorder has been renamed gender dysphoria to help avoid
    stigma associated with the word disorder.
- Paraphilias have been renamed paraphilic disorders to help distinguish the dis-
    orders from nonpathological sexual preference (paraphilia).

## This new chapter on disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct

disorders brings together disorders that appeared in the DSM-IV chapters “Disorders
Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” (oppositional defi-
ant disorder, conduct disorder), “Personality Disorders” (antisocial personality disor-
der—see Chapter 18 for diagnostic criteria and a detailed description), and “Impulse-
Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified” (intermittent explosive disorder, pyro-
mania, kleptomania). The chapter represents a departure from DSM-IV, but reflects
the approach taken by the DSM-5 Task Force to group related disorders based on clin-
ical and biological evidence. The disorders are listed in Table 15–1.
These disorders are unified by the presence of impaired self-regulation that results
in difficult, disruptive, aggressive, or antisocial behavior. These behaviors are usually
multidetermined and associated with physical or verbal injury to self, others, or ob-
jects, or with violating the rights of others. They appear in several forms and may be
defensive, premeditated, or impulsive. Whereas defensive aggression is normative,
premeditated and impulsive forms of aggression are viewed as pathological. Addition-
ally, some disruptive behavior may be normative during adolescent development, but
repeated disruptive behavior may represent a maladaptive behavioral trait that be-
gins early in life and continues into adulthood.

**TABLE 15–1. DSM-5 disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders**

Throughout the history of DSM, anger, rage, and aggression have characterized a
number of personality and problematic behavior disorders. In DSM-I, aggression was
specifically identified as occurring in persons with passive-aggressive personality, ag-
gressive type. In DSM-II, explosive personality (epileptoid personality disorder) was
added and was described as follows: “This behavior pattern is characterized by gross
outbursts of rage or of verbal or physical aggressiveness. These outbursts are strikingly
different from the patient’s usual behavior, and he may be regretful and repentant for
them” (American Psychiatric Association 1968, p. 42).
Several additional disorders occurring in adults have specifically featured aggres-
sion as a symptom. Intermittent explosive disorder was introduced in DSM-III to de-
scribe persons with episodes of aggression grossly out of proportion to precipitating
stressors, and was considered a rough equivalent to explosive personality. The disor-
der continued mostly unchanged through DSM-IV. Isolated explosive disorder, also
introduced in DSM-III, was used to describe persons with a single, discrete episode
of uncharacteristic aggression. This disorder was dropped from subsequent editions
because of its limited utility. Aggressive behavior was listed as a criterion for antiso-
cial personality disorder in DSM-III (Criterion C5) and DSM-IV (Criterion A4).
Among youth, several diagnoses have featured aggressive or oppositional behav-
ior. Most prominent is oppositional defiant disorder, which describes a persistent pat-
tern of negativistic, hostile, defiant, and disobedient behaviors toward others. Another
is conduct disorder, which is a persistent pattern of behavior that involves significant
violations of the rights of others and/or major societal norms.
The history of disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders dates to DSM-II
and the category “Behavior Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence,” which was lim-
ited to a small number of diagnoses described as arising from divergent environmental
factors: runaway reaction, unsocialized aggressive reaction, and group delinquent reac-
tion. (Interestingly, although the word _reaction_ was discarded for DSM-II adult diagno-
ses, the word was retained for use in child and adolescent diagnoses.) The runaway
reaction diagnosis described individuals who fled threatening situations at home and
engaged in covert acts of stealing as a means of self-preservation. The unsocialized ag-
gressive reaction diagnosis described loners with a pattern of hostile disobedience,
aggressiveness, stealing, and lying, whose behaviors arose primarily as a reaction to in-


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **297**

consistent discipline and parental rejection. The group delinquent reaction diagnosis
included individuals who committed predominately nonaggressive acts as part of a de-
linquent peer group, and their behavior problems were purportedly a consequence of
being poorly monitored in an impoverished neighborhood.
In DSM-III, this category was renamed “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in In-
fancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” and was expanded to include a large number of
diagnoses of varying degrees of severity and stability. Oppositional disorder and con-
duct disorder were among the new diagnoses. The former was renamed oppositional
defiant disorder in DSM-III-R. Conduct disorder was considered the childhood pre-
cursor to antisocial personality disorder, which was not to be diagnosed unless the in-
dividual was at least age 18 years. This condition was distinct from oppositional
disorder, which primarily involved disobedient opposition to authority figures, but
not overt aggression. The presence of conduct disorder excluded the diagnosis of op-
positional disorder because it was believed that oppositional behavior was a feature
of most individuals with conduct disorder.
In DSM-5, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder are now grouped
with antisocial personality disorder and intermittent explosive disorder, thereby re-
flecting emerging evidence supporting their clinical and biological commonality
along a developmental spectrum. Antisocial personality disorder involves violations
of the rights of others. Intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by impulsive
aggressive and assaultive behaviors that are out of proportion to stressors.

Oppositional Defiant Disorder

Irritability, anger, defiance, and temper are specific descriptors of oppositional defi-
ant disorder (Burke et al. 2002). In DSM-III, this disorder was introduced as opposi-
tional disorder and was characterized by a negative and disobedient opposition to
authority. The authors of DSM-5 consider oppositional defiant disorder to be a devel-
opmental antecedent for some youth with conduct disorder, thereby suggesting that
the disorders may reflect different stages of a spectrum of disruptive behavior. In fact,
DSM-5 organizes oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial per-
sonality disorder hierarchically and developmentally to reflect age-dependent ex-
pressions of the same underlying diathesis. Transient oppositional behavior is very
common in childhood and adolescence, but oppositional defiant disorder occurs in
1%–11% of youth. The disorder is more prevalent in boys before puberty and has an equal
gender prevalence for young people after puberty. Clinicians can specify whether the dis-
order is mild, moderate, or severe.

Diagnostic Criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder **313.81 (F91.3)**

A. A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness
lasting at least 6 months as evidenced by at least four symptoms from any of the fol-
lowing categories, and exhibited during interaction with at least one individual who is
not a sibling.


**298** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
Angry/Irritable Mood
```
1. Often loses temper.
2. Is often touchy or easily annoyed.
3. Is often angry and resentful.
**Argumentative/Defiant Behavior**
4. Often argues with authority figures or, for children and adolescents, with adults.
5. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures
    or with rules.
6. Often deliberately annoys others.
7. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.
**Vindictiveness**
8. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months.
**Note:** The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should be used to distin-
guish a behavior that is within normal limits from a behavior that is symptomatic.
For children younger than 5 years, the behavior should occur on most days for a
period of at least 6 months unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals
5 years or older, the behavior should occur at least once per week for at least 6
months, unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). While these frequency criteria pro-
vide guidance on a minimal level of frequency to define symptoms, other factors
should also be considered, such as whether the frequency and intensity of the be-
haviors are outside a range that is normative for the individual’s developmental
level, gender, and culture.

B. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the individual or others in his
or her immediate social context (e.g., family, peer group, work colleagues), or it im-
pacts negatively on social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of func-
tioning.
C. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic, sub-
stance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the criteria are not met for dis-
ruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Symptoms are confined to only one setting (e.g., at home, at school, at work,
with peers).
**Moderate:** Some symptoms are present in at least two settings.
**Severe:** Some symptoms are present in three or more settings.

Criterion A

Even well-adjusted children can display behaviors consistent with one or more of the
symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder. Symptoms of oppositional defiant disor-
der, however, must be part of a pattern of behavior that is frequent and not typical for
the child’s developmental level. Over a 6-month period, the child must demonstrate
at least four of eight behavioral symptoms, which have been grouped into three log-
ical categories: angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, and vindic-
tiveness. Although in DSM-IV the criterion stated that the behaviors are exhibited


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **299**

“often,” little guidance was provided about how to objectively define _often._ DSM-5 pro-
vides clarification as to the necessary frequency of behavior and distinguishes it by
age: “For children younger than 5 years, the behavior should occur on most days for
a period of at least 6 months unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8).” For individuals
5 years or older, the behavior should occur at least once per week for at least 6 months,
unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8).”
The essential behaviors have not changed from those in DSM-IV except that vindic-
tive behavior has been refined to require at least two episodes during the past 6 months.
Another change requires that these behaviors not have been exhibited only in relation
to a sibling.
In DSM-5, the behaviors are grouped depending on whether they are emotional
or behavioral in nature. Research suggests that the symptoms of oppositional defiant
disorder are highly intercorrelated and that all contribute to the prediction of disrup-
tive behavior disorder outcomes. However, the emotional symptoms independently
predict mood and anxiety disorders.

Criterion B

The disorder is associated with distress in the individual or in others in his or her im-
mediate social context, or impacts negatively on social, educational, vocational, or
other important areas of functioning. This criterion helps distinguish occasional dis-
ruptive behavior in an otherwise well-adjusted child or adolescent from disruptive
behavior of someone with a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. In a study of
youth with DSM-IV oppositional defiant disorder (Burke et al 2002), nearly all sub-
jects reported trouble at home (96%) and in school (85%), and fewer had trouble with
peers (67%).

Criterion C

DSM-5 does not include the exclusionary criterion of DSM-IV that allowed for the di-
agnosis of oppositional defiant disorder only if the criteria for conduct disorder were
not met. _The two diagnoses may now be comorbid._ This change was based on research
which suggested that presence or absence of comorbid oppositional defiant disorder
helped predict outcome in conduct disorder.

Intermittent Explosive Disorder

Intermittent explosive disorder was introduced in DSM-III, but precursors included
the DSM-I passive-aggressive personality, aggressive type, characterized as “persis-
tent reaction to frustration with irritability, temper tantrums, and destructive behav-
ior,” and the DSM-II explosive personality. Individuals with the latter were
aggressive individuals with intermittently violent behavior. In DSM-III, this behavior
pattern was codified as intermittent explosive disorder and assigned to Axis I of the
new multiaxial system, rather than as a personality disorder on Axis II.
Aggressive outbursts in this disorder are characterized by rapid onset and short
duration; there is usually little or no prodrome. Episodes involve verbal assault, de-


**300** DSM-5 Guidebook

structive and nondestructive property assault, or injurious or noninjurious physical
assault. Aggressive outbursts most commonly occur in response to a minor provoca-
tion by a close intimate or associate, and subjects with intermittent explosive disorder
often have less severe episodes of verbal and nondestructive property assault be-
tween the more severe destructive-assaultive episodes. Episodes lead to substantial
subjective distress, impairment in social functioning, occupational difficulty, or legal
or financial problems. Research evidence suggests that “recurrent, problematic, impul-
sive aggression” has a prevalence of 5%–7% in the general adult population and per-
haps a higher percentage in psychiatric hospitals and clinics (Coccaro 2012).

Diagnostic Criteria for Intermittent
Explosive Disorder **312.34 (F63.81)**

A. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impuls-
es as manifested by either of the following:

1. Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights)
    or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring
    twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months. The physical aggression
    does not result in damage or destruction of property and does not result in
    physical injury to animals or other individuals.
2. Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and/or
physical assault involving physical injury against animals or other individuals
occurring within a 12-month period.
B. The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is
grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial
stressors.
C. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive
and/or anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective
(e.g., money, power, intimidation).
D. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in the individual
or impairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or are associated with
financial or legal consequences.
E. Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmental level).
F. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation dis-
order, a psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality
disorder) and are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alz-
heimer’s disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,
a medication). For children ages 6–18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part
of an adjustment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis.

**Note:** This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spec-
trum disorder when recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those
usually seen in these disorders and warrant independent clinical attention.


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **301**

Criterion A

The DSM-5 criteria operationalize the scope, frequency, and time frame for aggressive
behavior required, allowing intermittent explosive disorder to be diagnosed in the
presence of aggressive outbursts of high frequency and low intensity (Criterion A1)
or of low frequency and high intensity (Criterion A2). The A1 threshold was set at an
average of two outbursts per week for at least 3 months because this level of low-
intensity aggression responds well to treatment. The threshold for Criterion A2 was
set at three severe outbursts per year because this level of high-intensity aggression
distinguishes individuals who are significantly more aggressive from those with a
lower frequency of severe aggressive outbursts.

Criterion B

The essence of the disorder is that the outburst is grossly out of proportion to what might
occur in most persons faced with a stressful situation. Clearly, aggressive behavior oc-
curs for many reasons in people with and without mental illnesses. This criterion
helps to define what is (or is not) attributable to a mental illness, by establishing that the
behavioral response is out of bounds.

Criterion C

This new criterion requires that the aggressive behavior be impulsive in nature, an
important distinction because empirical data clearly separate impulsive from pre-
meditated aggression. This distinction helps to separate aggressive behavior that is
planned from that which occurs spontaneously and without reflection. The criterion
also helps to separate the outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder from aggres-
sive outbursts calculated to achieve an objective, such as frightening or intimidating
others, as might occur in a person with antisocial personality disorder.

Criterion D

In keeping with other disorders, intermittent explosive disorder in DSM-5 includes
the requirement that marked subjective distress or social or occupational dysfunction
be linked to the aggressive behavior. The disorder may cause considerable subjective
distress as the individual copes with the consequences of his or her behavior. For
most, the behavior is ego-dystonic and leads to feelings of embarrassment and re-
morse (unlike in antisocial personality disorder, in which the individual may not
experience either emotion). Because the outburst is disproportionate, it may disrupt
relationships, lead to occupational problems (e.g., being fired), or contribute to legal
problems if victims suffer personal injuries or must deal with property damage. Al-
though not stated, the intent of the diagnosis is not to provide legal cover for those
whose aggressive acts have selfish, financial, or political motives.

Criterion E

Intermittent explosive disorder appears as early as prepubertal childhood and peaks
in mid-adolescence, with a mean onset age ranging from about 13 to 21 years. Data also


**302** DSM-5 Guidebook

suggest that the disorder is persistent and follows a chronic course of at least 12 years.
By establishing a minimum age (or equivalent developmental level) of 6 years, DSM-5
authors are encouraging clinicians to use other diagnoses for children with recurrent
temper outbursts (i.e., disruptive mood dysregulation disorder), because the course
of such outbursts in a young child is of unclear significance.

Criterion F

Exclusions have changed. DSM-5 allows individuals with autism spectrum disorder,
other disruptive behavior disorders (conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disor-
der), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to be diagnosed with inter-
mittent explosive disorder. Although individuals with these disorders are sometimes
aggressive, the pattern of aggressive acts in these conditions tends to differ from that
seen in intermittent explosive disorder. For that reason, the DSM-5 ADHD and Disrup-
tive Behavior Disorders Work Group recommended that these exclusions be dropped.
Importantly, other exclusions remain, including antisocial and borderline personality
disorders. Also, aggressive behavior occurring in children ages 6–18 years who have
an adjustment disorder is not counted toward a diagnosis of intermittent explosive
disorder.

Conduct Disorder

The essential feature of conduct disorder is a repetitive and persistent pattern of be-
havior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate social norms or
rules are violated (Burke et al. 2002). The behaviors may entail aggressive conduct
that causes or threatens harm to others or animals, nonaggressive behavior resulting
in property damage, deceitfulness or theft, or serious violations of rules. General pop-
ulation surveys report prevalence rates ranging from 2% to more than 10%, and the
rates are higher in boys than in girls.
Conduct disorder was introduced in DSM-III. Four primary subtypes were pro-
posed on the basis of whether the individual exhibited aggressive (e.g., assault, rape)
or nonaggressive (e.g., lying, stealing) conduct problems and whether the individual
was socialized (e.g., has lasting friendships, feels guilt/remorse) or unsocialized (e.g.,
has no close friendships, lacks guilt/remorse). These subtypes were based largely on
subtypes of delinquency originally described in DSM-II, and symptoms and diag-
nostic thresholds were specified for each subgroup. The criteria were simplified in
DSM-III-R to include a single set of symptoms (e.g., being physically cruel to people,
destroying property, stealing, being truant) rather than having four subtypes. Each
symptom had to be present for at least 6 months to reach diagnostic threshold. DSM-
IV field trials supported adding bullying, threatening, or intimidating others to the
diagnostic criteria, as well as often staying out after dark without permission begin-
ning before age 13 years.
The criteria are essentially unchanged from DSM-IV. In addition to maintaining
the age-at-onset subtypes (childhood-onset type, adolescence-onset type), the work
group added the specifier “with limited prosocial emotions” to describe the childhood


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **303**

equivalent of the adult with psychopathy. _Psychopathy_ is a distinct syndrome that falls
within the antisocial spectrum and is characterized by lack of empathy and concern
for the feelings, wishes, and well-being of others. These traits are found in a minority
of youth with conduct disorder. Research suggests that individuals with conduct dis-
order who exhibit callous and unemotional traits have a worse outcome and poorer
response to treatment than do those without these traits.

Diagnostic Criteria for Conduct Disorder

A. A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or
major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated, as manifested by the
presence of at least three of the following 15 criteria in the past 12 months from any
of the categories below, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months:
**Aggression to People and Animals**

1. Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others.
2. Often initiates physical fights.
3. Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others (e.g., a bat,
    brick, broken bottle, knife, gun).
4. Has been physically cruel to people.
5. Has been physically cruel to animals.
6. Has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching, extor-
    tion, armed robbery).
7. Has forced someone into sexual activity.
**Destruction of Property**
8. Has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious
    damage.
9. Has deliberately destroyed others’ property (other than by fire setting).
**Deceitfulness or Theft**
10. Has broken into someone else’s house, building, or car.
11. Often lies to obtain goods or favors or to avoid obligations (i.e., “cons” others).
12. Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim (e.g., shoplift-
ing, but without breaking and entering; forgery).
**Serious Violations of Rules**
13. Often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions, beginning before age 13
years.
14. Has run away from home overnight at least twice while living in the parental or
parental surrogate home, or once without returning for a lengthy period.
15. Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13 years.

B. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social, ac-
ademic, or occupational functioning.
C. If the individual is age 18 years or older, criteria are not met for antisocial person-
ality disorder.


**304** DSM-5 Guidebook

Specify whether:
**312.81 (F91.1) Childhood-onset type:** Individuals show at least one symptom
characteristic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years.
**312.82 (F91.2) Adolescent-onset type:** Individuals show no symptom character-
istic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years.
**312.89 (F91.9) Unspecified onset:** Criteria for a diagnosis of conduct disorder are
met, but there is not enough information available to determine whether the onset
of the first symptom was before or after age 10 years.

Specify if:
**With limited prosocial emotions:** To qualify for this specifier, an individual must
have displayed at least two of the following characteristics persistently over at least 12
months and in multiple relationships and settings. These characteristics reflect the in-
dividual’s typical pattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning over this period
and not just occasional occurrences in some situations. Thus, to assess the criteria for
the specifier, multiple information sources are necessary. In addition to the individual’s
self-report, it is necessary to consider reports by others who have known the individual
for extended periods of time (e.g., parents, teachers, co-workers, extended family
members, peers).
**Lack of remorse or guilt:** Does not feel bad or guilty when he or she does
something wrong (exclude remorse when expressed only when caught and/or
facing punishment). The individual shows a general lack of concern about the
negative consequences of his or her actions. For example, the individual is not
remorseful after hurting someone or does not care about the consequences of
breaking rules.
**Callous—lack of empathy:** Disregards and is unconcerned about the feelings
of others. The individual is described as cold and uncaring. The person ap-
pears more concerned about the effects of his or her actions on himself or her-
self, rather than their effects on others, even when they result in substantial
harm to others.
**Unconcerned about performance:** Does not show concern about poor/prob-
lematic performance at school, at work, or in other important activities. The in-
dividual does not put forth the effort necessary to perform well, even when
expectations are clear, and typically blames others for his or her poor perfor-
mance.
**Shallow or deficient affect:** Does not express feelings or show emotions to oth-
ers, except in ways that seem shallow, insincere, or superficial (e.g., actions con-
tradict the emotion displayed; can turn emotions “on” or “off” quickly) or when
emotional expressions are used for gain (e.g., emotions displayed to manipulate
or intimidate others).

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Few if any conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diag-
nosis are present, and conduct problems cause relatively minor harm to others
(e.g., lying, truancy, staying out after dark without permission, other rule breaking).
**Moderate:** The number of conduct problems and the effect on others are interme-
diate between those specified in “mild” and those in “severe” (e.g., stealing without
confronting a victim, vandalism).


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **305**

```
Severe: Many conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis
are present, or conduct problems cause considerable harm to others (e.g., forced sex,
physical cruelty, use of a weapon, stealing while confronting a victim, breaking and en-
tering).
```
Criterion A

The list of 15 problem areas is unchanged from DSM-IV, as are the requirements that
three or more be present in the past 12 months and that the pattern of behavior be re-
petitive and persistent. Most children with conduct disorder have far more than three
symptoms. Although occasional problematic behaviors are normal (and even ex-
pected) to some extent in children, the severity and variety of these behaviors charac-
terize the person with conduct disorder.

Criterion B

Conduct disorder causes clinically significant impairment and distress to the child,
family, school, and community because of the inevitable conflicts that occur with par-
ents, teachers, and peers. Financial and legal repercussions, as well as physical injuries
from accidents or fights, are common. Poor frustration tolerance, irritability, temper
outbursts, and recklessness are frequently associated symptoms. Conduct disorder
behaviors may lead to school suspension or expulsion, problems in work adjustment,
sexually transmitted diseases, and unwanted pregnancy. These problems may pre-
clude attendance in ordinary schools or living in the parental home.

Criterion C

Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder lie along a continuum. Al-
though conduct disorder technically can be diagnosed at any age, the intention is that
it describes a childhood behavioral syndrome that is the precursor to antisocial per-
sonality disorder. Approximately 40% of young people with conduct disorder will
manifest antisocial personality disorder later in life.

Subtypes and Specifiers

Age-at-onset subtypes are unchanged from DSM-IV. The age at onset should be ob-
tained from both the youth and the caregiver. These subtypes have clinical and treat-
ment ramifications, because an individual with the childhood-onset subtype is more
likely to have co-occurring ADHD, to display physical aggression toward others, and
to develop antisocial personality disorder.
DSM-5 includes the new descriptive feature specifier “with limited prosocial emo-
tions.” These traits were suggested in the DSM-III “undersocialized type.” However,
this subtype was not continued in subsequent DSM editions because the term _under-
socialized_ was thought to be overly focused on social attachment. On the other hand,
research shows that the presence of limited prosocial emotions can delineate a subtype
with a particularly severe and recalcitrant form of antisocial behavior; distinct neuro-


**306** DSM-5 Guidebook

logical, cognitive, emotional, and social characteristics (e.g., deficits in processing
signs of fear and distress in others, less sensitivity to punishment, more fearless or
thrill-seeking behavior); and poorer treatment outcomes. In addition, limited proso-
cial emotions are relatively stable from childhood to early adolescence and early adult-
hood, and may be genetically influenced.

Antisocial Personality Disorder

Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of poor social
conformity, deceitfulness, impulsivity, criminality, and lack of remorse. Because the
disorder is closely connected with the spectrum of externalizing disorders discussed
in this class, it is dually coded here and in the chapter on personality disorders. For a
complete description of antisocial personality disorder and the DSM-5 criteria, see
Chapter 18, “Personality Disorders.”

Pyromania

Pyromania is characterized by an impulse to set fires. The disorder was first formally
recognized in DSM-III in the new category “Disorders of Impulse-Control Not Else-
where Classified.” Similar to the earlier idea of monomania, the definition focused on
the recurrent failure to resist impulses to set fire in persons who were not psychotic,
cognitively impaired, or antisocial. In DSM-III-R, these exclusions were removed and
an item was added to recognize that persons with pyromania tend to be fascinated
with or curious about fires. In DSM-IV, exclusions for mania and antisocial personality
disorder were restored. Other than minor editing, the DSM-5 criteria are unchanged.
The essential features of pyromania are the presence of multiple episodes of delib-
erate and purposeful fire setting and the failure to resist an impulse to set fires. Persons
with pyromania like watching fire. They may be recognized as regular “watchers” at
fires in their communities and enjoy setting off false fire alarms. Their fascination
leads some to seek employment or to volunteer as firefighters. They may be indiffer-
ent to the consequences of the fire and its effect on life and property, and they may get
satisfaction from the resulting destruction. The behavior may lead to property dam-
age, legal consequences, or injury or loss of life to the fire setter or to others.

Diagnostic Criteria for Pyromania **312.33 (F63.1)**

A. Deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion.
B. Tension or affective arousal before the act.
C. Fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational
contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses, consequences).
D. Pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting fires or when witnessing or participat-
ing in their aftermath.
E. The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an expression of sociopolitical
ideology, to conceal criminal activity, to express anger or vengeance, to improve


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **307**

one’s living circumstances, in response to a delusion or hallucination, or as a result
of impaired judgment (e.g., in major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability
[intellectual developmental disorder], substance intoxication).
F. The fire setting is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or anti-
social personality disorder.

Criterion A

This criterion requires that fire setting occur on more than one occasion. This sets the
bar at a minimum of two lifetime episodes. In truth, most persons with pyromania
will have committed far more episodes of fire setting, with some individuals setting
fires on a regular basis.

Criteria B, C, and D

These criteria get at the essence of the disorder. The sense of excitation is captured by
the individual’s sense of tension or affective arousal before the act, as well as pleasure,
gratification, or relief during or after the act. Most persons with pyromania have a fas-
cination with fire that may be reflected by their interest in watching fires. They spend
considerable time planning, setting, and watching fires.

Criteria E and F

These criteria exclude those individuals who set fires for political or other reasons
(such as arson for monetary gain) and those who set fires during a manic episode or
as part of a pattern of antisocial personality disorder.

Kleptomania

Although kleptomania has long been recognized, it was not officially designated a
psychiatric disorder until DSM-III, when it was placed in the category “Disorders of
Impulse-Control Not Elsewhere Classified.” In DSM-5, the criteria are essentially un-
changed.
The prevalence of kleptomania has been estimated at 0.3%–0.6% in the general
population. Among individuals hospitalized for mental health reasons, however,
research has demonstrated that nearly 8% endorse symptoms consistent with the cur-
rent diagnosis of kleptomania and 9% endorse a lifetime diagnosis (Grant et al. 2005).
The literature suggests that the majority of people with kleptomania are women, al-
though the gender disparity may be due to the fact that women are more likely to
present for treatment. The disorder typically has an onset by late adolescence (but
may begin in adulthood) and is often comorbid with mood, anxiety, and substance
use disorders.
People with kleptomania experience significant impairment in social and occupa-
tional functioning. Their intrusive thoughts and urges related to stealing can interfere
with their ability to concentrate at home and at work. Others report missing work, of-
ten in the afternoon, in order to steal. Inability to control their behavior leads to


**308** DSM-5 Guidebook

subjective feelings of shame and guilt. The disorder also leads to high levels of stress
that worsen as the stealing behavior intensifies. Additionally, many people with klep-
tomania face legal difficulties and experience public humiliation from arrests.

Diagnostic Criteria for Kleptomania **312.32 (F63.2)**

A. Recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not needed for personal
use or for their monetary value.
B. Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the theft.
C. Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the theft.
D. The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance and is not in re-
sponse to a delusion or a hallucination.
E. The stealing is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or anti-
social personality disorder.

Criterion A

This item focuses on the stealing that is performed in response to senseless urges for
unneeded items. This has often been considered the criterion that distinguishes indi-
viduals with kleptomania from ordinary shoplifters. Interpretation of this criterion is
controversial. The stereotype of the middle-aged female kleptomania patient who
steals particular items may not adequately account for all people with kleptomania.
Individuals with kleptomania may in fact desire the items they steal and be able to
use them, but they do not need them. This may be particularly the case with individ-
uals with kleptomania who also hoard items. These individuals may steal multiple
versions of the same item; although the item itself may be desired, it is not needed.

Criteria B and C

Many individuals will report a sense of tension immediately before committing the
theft, as well as pleasure or gratification afterward. These criteria have sometimes
been problematic because occasional individuals will deny feelings of tension or arousal
prior to the act and may deny feelings of pleasure or relief following the thefts, yet
they clearly have a problem with stealing of unneeded objects.

Criterion D

This item helps to separate people with a motivation to steal (“to express anger or
vengeance”) from the ordinary person with kleptomania who simply fails to resist an
impulse. Furthermore, the stealing is not motivated by psychotic thinking.

Criterion E

These exclusions are needed because during manic episodes, individuals may take ob-
jects in response to their abnormal thinking and behavior. A youth with a conduct dis-
order and an adult with antisocial personality disorder may steal because they want


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **309**

the items; this is stealing in the ordinary sense. Their stealing is done without concern
for the consequences of their behavior or the people they may hurt in the process.

Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control,

and Conduct Disorder and Unspecified

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and

Conduct Disorder

These two residual categories are available to clinicians for use in diagnosing presen-
tations characteristic of disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause
distress or impairment but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the
class. The category other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder
is also used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet full criteria (e.g., “recurrent behavioral
outbursts of insufficient frequency”).

Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and
Conduct Disorder **312.89(F91.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control, and
conduct disorders diagnostic class. The other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and
conduct disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any spe-
cific disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder. This is done by recording “other
specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder” followed by the specific rea-
son (e.g., “recurrent behavioral outbursts of insufficient frequency”).

The category unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder is used
in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria
for a specific disorder are not met, or there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis.

Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and
Conduct Disorder **312.9 (F91.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate
but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control,


**310** DSM-5 Guidebook

and conduct disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and
conduct disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific disruptive, impulse-control,
and conduct disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient informa-
tion to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- This new chapter brings together disorders unified by the presence of difficult,
    disruptive, aggressive, or antisocial behavior. The disorders include opposition-
    al defiant disorder, conduct disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, antisocial
    personality disorder, pyromania, and kleptomania.
- DSM-5 has removed the exclusionary criterion of DSM-IV that allowed for the
    diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder only if the criteria for conduct disorder
    were not met. The two diagnoses may now be comorbid.
- Intermittent explosive disorder requires outbursts to be either high frequency
    and low intensity (at least two outbursts per week for 3 months) or low frequency
    and high intensity (three or more severe outbursts a year).
- Conduct disorder now has a “with limited prosocial emotions” specifier that allows
    clinicians to denote youth with the childhood equivalent of psychopathic traits
    such as lack of remorse or guilt, or callousness. These youth typically have a
    worse prognosis and response to treatment.
- While antisocial personality disorder is listed with this class, the criteria and text
    remain in the chapter on personality disorders.

312.31 (F63.0)** Gambling Disorder

The substance-related disorders are divided according to 10 classes
of substances: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens; inhalants; opioids; sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; tobacco; and other (or unknown) substances.
These are presented in separate sections, but they are not fully distinct because all
drugs taken in excess activate the brain’s reward circuitry, and their co-occurring use
is common. Instead of achieving reward system activation through adaptive behav-
iors, drugs of abuse short-circuit the normal processes that directly activate these
structures. Each class produces a range of behavioral effects, including the “high”


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **313**

that fuels their use. The hallucinogens are an exception in that curiosity rather than
euphoria is a major motivation for taking them.
Many substances described in this chapter, along with some prescribed and over-
the-counter drugs, can also cause substance-induced disorders that resemble indepen-
dent mood or anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, or other disorders, except that
the substance-induced disorders are usually temporary. These categories of disorder
are discussed in the relevant chapters on the basis of symptoms (e.g., anxiety disorders,
depressive disorders).
An important departure from DSM-IV is that the current chapter now includes
gambling disorder, formerly listed as pathological gambling in the chapter “Impulse-
Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified.” The disorder has been moved because
of evidence showing that gambling activates the same brain reward system, with ef-
fects similar to those produced by drugs of abuse (Potenza 2006). Other behaviors (the
so-called _behavioral addictions_ , such as Internet use and compulsive shopping) appear
to have a similar effect on reward systems, but the Substance-Related Disorders Work
Group concluded that the research on these behaviors was insufficient for their inclu-
sion. Nonetheless, Internet gaming disorder has been placed in the chapter “Conditions
for Further Study” in Section III to encourage research.
The substance use disorders have been recognized in all DSM editions. In DSM-I,
the _addictions_ (alcoholism, drug addiction) were placed within the umbrella category
“sociopathic personality disturbance,” reflecting the thinking at the time that individ-
uals with these problems were ill in terms of “society and of conformity with the pre-
vailing cultural milieu” (p. 38). In DSM-II, _alcoholism_ and the renamed _drug dependence_
were placed within the class “personality disorders and certain other non-psychotic
mental disorders.” Alcoholism was further divided into _episodic excessive drinking,
habitual excessive drinking,_ and _alcohol addiction._ The latter diagnosis was reserved for
individuals considered dependent on alcohol. Ten subcategories were created for var-
ious drug dependencies (e.g., “opium, opium alkaloids, and their derivatives”). In
DSM-III, the substance use disorders were finally given their own chapter, and the
class was greatly expanded to recognize the many drugs that were commonly mis-
used. Criteria, as well as the major divisions of abuse and dependence, were devel-
oped for DSM-III, with refinement of the diagnostic class continuing in DSM-5.
The chapter is organized such that disorders (i.e., use disorders, intoxication, and
withdrawal) are placed according to substance. The broad diagnostic categories asso-
ciated with each specific group of substances are shown in Table 16–1. Stimulant-
related disorder diagnoses have replaced the categories for amphetamine and cocaine
use disorders. Cannabis use disorder and cannabis withdrawal are new. Caffeine with-
drawal has been elevated to the status of an independent disorder from DSM-IV’s Ap-
pendix B, “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study.” Nicotine use disorders
are now called tobacco-related disorders_._
Perhaps the most important change is that a distinction is no longer made be-
tween “abuse” of and “dependence” on alcohol or other drugs, and the two diagno-
ses have been merged. In fact, the term _dependence_ is not used in this chapter in DSM-
5 to avoid overlap with the use of the term to describe pharmacological tolerance and
withdrawal. Also, rather than having generic “substance abuse” and “substance de-

pendence” criteria sets, each class of drug has its own criteria set for a “use disorder.”
The historic distinction had been based on the belief that a dependence syndrome was
a psychobiological process leading to impaired control resulting from persistent,
heavy drinking or drug use. A dependence syndrome was thought to have a different
cause from that of excessive alcohol or drug use that resulted only in social or per-
sonal problems, giving rise to a “biaxial” concept of substance misuse, with depen-
dence on one axis and consequences (i.e., abuse) on the other. These concepts were
incorporated into the substance use disorders chapters in DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and
DSM-IV. Furthermore, in DSM-III-R and DSM-IV, dependence took precedence hier-
archically over abuse. DSM-IV required that three of seven criteria be met for depen-
dence and one of four for abuse.
There were several reasons to combine abuse and dependence. First, clinicians
had trouble distinguishing the syndromes. Whereas studies showed that test-retest
reliability of DSM-IV dependence was uniformly very good to excellent, the reliability
of DSM-IV abuse was lower and more variable. Many assumed that abuse was often a
prodromal phase of dependence, but several prospective studies showed that this
was not the case. Second, epidemiological studies showed that the most common way
for DSM-IV alcohol abuse to be diagnosed was with a single criterion (Criterion A2)—
that is, hazardous use (generally driving after drinking). Although this behavior is
certainly unwise and risky, basing a psychiatric diagnosis on a single symptom is
questionable. Third, the division between abuse and dependence led to “diagnostic
orphans,” whereby a person could meet two criteria for dependence but none for
abuse. Such individuals, who could have substance use problems of the same severity
as others with a diagnosis, were left undiagnosed. Subsequent analyses on the struc-
ture of abuse and dependence in clinical and epidemiological samples suggested that
DSM-IV abuse and dependence criteria could be considered to form a unidimen-
sional structure, with abuse and dependence criteria interspersed across the severity
spectrum. Considering this evidence, the work group recommended that abuse and
dependence be combined into a single disorder of graded clinical severity, with two
criteria required for the diagnosis (Helzer et al. 2006). An additional recommendation
was to eliminate the legal problems criterion for addictive disorders (Criterion A3 for
DSM-IV substance abuse). Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol
and Related Conditions and other studies had shown that the item had a low preva-
lence relative to other criteria and that its deletion would have little effect on the prev-
alence of substance use disorders, while adding little information to the diagnoses in
the aggregate. For that reason, the criterion has been deleted from the criteria sets for all
addictive disorders.
Intoxication is a separate disorder for each substance. _Intoxication_ is considered a
reversible substance-specific syndrome resulting from the recent use of a substance.
The _disorder_ of intoxication requires that this syndrome result in clinically significant
impairment or problematic behavioral or psychological changes. Likewise, _with-
drawal_ is listed for most of the substances as a distinct disorder. The drug withdrawal
syndrome consists of a cluster of symptoms that 1) are valid and reliably observed and
2) have a clear time course that includes onset closely following cessation of the drug
and a return to baseline levels. Furthermore, the syndrome must be pharmacologi-


**316** DSM-5 Guidebook

cally specific to deprivation of the drug or one of its components and associated with
clinically important consequences (e.g., contributes to relapse, causes significant phys-
ical or psychological problems).
Finally, _craving_ is defined as a strong desire for a substance, usually a specific sub-
stance. It is a common symptom and tends to be present toward the severe end of the
severity spectrum. It has been variously defined as a trait with a time component
(present or recent past) or as a lifetime component (ever experienced in one’s life). As
a time-limited state, craving has often been frequently used as an outcome measure,
and brain imaging studies have demonstrated subjective craving precipitated by
drug-related cues and correlated with increased activity and dopamine release in spe-
cific parts of the brain reward system. On the basis of these data, craving has been
added as a symptom for substance use disorders.
Each of the substance use disorders, as well as gambling disorder, has specifiers
for “early remission” and “sustained remission.” “In early remission” indicates that
for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months, none of the items in Criterion A have
been met except the criterion relating to craving. “In sustained remission” indicates none
of the items in Criterion A have been met for 12 months or longer, except the criterion
relating to craving. Gambling disorder has the same definitions for early and sus-
tained remission but does not include the craving exception because that is not a cri-
terion for gambling disorder. In the case of opioid and tobacco use disorders, the
specifier “on maintenance therapy” may also be used. This additional specifier is used
if the individual is taking a prescribed agonist medication, such as methadone or bu-
prenorphine, or nicotine replacement medication, and none of the criteria for opioid
or tobacco use disorder have been met for that class of medication (except tolerance
to, or withdrawal from, the agonist or replacement medication).
The additional specifier “in a controlled environment” indicates that the person
has been in an environment where access to alcohol and drugs is restricted, such as
jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units. The “controlled environ-
ment” specifier does not apply to gambling disorder. Finally, each use disorder has a
severity specifier (mild, moderate, severe) based on the number of criteria met for
that disorder. Unlike the substance use disorders, gambling disorder has the addi-
tional specifier for whether the disorder is episodic (i.e., meeting diagnostic criteria at
more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling
disorder for at least several months) or persistent (i.e., continuous symptoms meeting
diagnostic criteria for multiple years) (Table 16–2).

ALCOHOL-RELATED DISORDERS

Alcohol is a commonly abused substance throughout the world and is associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. At some point in their lives, at least 80% of adults
in the United States have had some experience with alcohol, and a substantial per-
centage have had one or more alcohol-related adverse events.
This section contains discussion specific to the alcohol-related disorders to convey
their unique features. Alcohol-induced disorders are also described in DSM-5 sec-
tions on disorders with which they share symptoms.

Alcohol Use Disorder

Alcohol use disorder describes a problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress. Two or more of 11 problematic behaviors must occur
within a 12-month period for the diagnosis to be made. This diagnosis replaces the cli-
nician’s choice in DSM-IV for a diagnosis of alcohol “abuse” or “dependence,” and the
11 DSM-5 symptoms represent a merging of those listed for each DSM-IV disorder. The
diagnosis of abuse required one of four symptoms, whereas dependence required three
of seven symptoms.
Although the criteria are not differentially weighted, clinicians historically have
often paid special attention to tolerance and withdrawal (particularly the latter) as in-
dications of a physiological component. Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by with-
drawal symptoms that develop 4–12 hours after the reduction of intake following


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **319**

prolonged, heavy ingestion. Because withdrawal can be unpleasant and intense, in-
dividuals who experience this condition may continue to consume alcohol despite its
adverse consequences. Some withdrawal symptoms, such as sleep problems, can per-
sist at a lower intensity for months and are felt to contribute to relapse. A minority of
individuals with an alcohol use disorder never experience clinically relevant levels of
alcohol withdrawal, and less than 10% ever experience severe complications, such as
delirium or seizures.
Craving is indicated by a strong desire to drink that makes it difficult to think of
much else. School and job performance may suffer either from the effects of drinking
or from actual intoxication on the job or at school. Child care or household responsi-
bilities may be neglected. Alcohol-related absences may occur as well. The individual
may use alcohol in physically hazardous circumstances. Finally, individuals with al-
cohol use disorder may continue to consume alcohol despite the knowledge that con-
tinued consumption poses significant social or interpersonal problems for them.

Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or
distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intend-
    ed.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alco-
hol use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alco-
hol, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.
5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at
work, school, or home.
6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-
sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
    duced because of alcohol use.
8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.
9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacer-
bated by alcohol.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or
desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of al-
cohol.


**320** DSM-5 Guidebook

11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
    a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to Criteria A and B
       of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal).
    b. Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken
       to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for alcohol use disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder have been met for at least 3 months
but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use alcohol,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for alcohol use disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder have been met at any time during
a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or
a strong desire or urge to use alcohol,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to alcohol is restricted.

**Code based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an alcohol intoxica-
tion, alcohol withdrawal, or another alcohol-induced mental disorder is also present,
do not use the codes below for alcohol use disorder. Instead, the comorbid alcohol
use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the alcohol-induced disorder code
(see the coding note for alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, or a specific alcohol-
induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid alcohol intoxication and
alcohol use disorder, only the alcohol intoxication code is given, with the 4th character
indicating whether the comorbid alcohol use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F10.129 for mild alcohol use disorder with alcohol intoxication or F10.229 for a mod-
erate or severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol intoxication.

Specify current severity:
**305.00 (F10.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**303.90 (F10.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**303.90 (F10.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Alcohol Intoxication

The essential feature of alcohol intoxication is the presence of clinically significant
problematic behavioral or psychological changes that develop in the context of the in-
gestion of alcohol. These changes are accompanied by evidence of impaired func-
tioning and judgment and, if intoxication is intense, can result in a life-threatening
situation. The symptoms must not be better explained by another medical condition,
are not a reflection of conditions such as delirium, and are not related to intoxication
with other depressant drugs such as sedatives and hypnotics. The levels of incoordi-
nation can interfere with driving abilities and with performing usual activities to the
point of causing accidents.
Alcohol intoxication is sometimes associated with amnesia for the events that oc-
curred during the course of the intoxication (“blackouts”). This phenomenon may be


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **321**

related to the presence of high blood alcohol levels and, perhaps, to the rapidity with
which this level is reached. Even during mild alcohol intoxication, different symp-
toms are likely to be observed at different time points. Evidence of mild intoxication
can be seen in most people after approximately two drinks. Early in the drinking pe-
riod, with blood alcohol levels rising, symptoms often include talkativeness, a sense
of well-being, and a bright, expansive mood. Later, particularly when levels are falling,
the individuals likely become progressively more depressed, withdrawn, and cogni-
tively impaired. At very high levels, a nontolerant person is likely to fall asleep and
enter a first stage of anesthesia. Higher blood alcohol levels can cause inhibition of res-
piration and pulse and even death.

Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Intoxication

A. Recent ingestion of alcohol.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., inap-
propriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment) that de-
veloped during, or shortly after, alcohol ingestion.
C. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly af-
ter, alcohol use:

1. Slurred speech.
2. Incoordination.
3. Unsteady gait.
4. Nystagmus.
5. Impairment in attention or memory.
6. Stupor or coma.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better
explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **303.00.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether there is a comorbid alcohol use disorder. If a mild alcohol use disorder is co-
morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F10.129,** and if a moderate or severe alcohol use dis-
order is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F10.229.** If there is no comorbid alcohol use
disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F10.929.**

Alcohol Withdrawal

The essential feature of alcohol withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic syn-
drome that develops after the cessation of or reduction in heavy and prolonged alco-
hol use. The withdrawal syndrome includes two or more of the symptoms listed in
Criterion B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or functional impair-
ment. The symptoms must not be due to another medical condition or mental or sub-
stance-related disorder. Symptoms can be relieved by the use of alcohol or the admin-
istration of benzodiazepines. The withdrawal symptoms typically begin when blood
concentrations of alcohol decline sharply, generally within 4–12 hours after alcohol


**322** DSM-5 Guidebook

use has stopped or been reduced. Because of the relatively fast metabolism of alcohol,
the intensity of symptoms usually peaks during the second day of abstinence and the
symptoms generally improve after 4–5 days from the last alcohol use. Symptoms of
anxiety, insomnia, and autonomic dysfunction may persist for up to 6 months at
lower levels of intensity.

Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Withdrawal

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use that has been heavy and prolonged.
B. Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours to a few days after
the cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use described in Criterion A:

1. Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or pulse rate greater than 100 bpm).
2. Increased hand tremor.
3. Insomnia.
4. Nausea or vomiting.
5. Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions.
6. Psychomotor agitation.
7. A n x i e t y.
8. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from
another substance.

Specify if:
**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier applies in the rare instance when
hallucinations (usually visual or tactile) occur with intact reality testing, or auditory,
visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **291.81.** The ICD-10-CM code for alcohol withdraw-
al without perceptual disturbances is **F10.239,** and the ICD-10-CM code for alcohol with-
drawal with perceptual disturbances is **F10.232.** Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates
the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder, reflecting the fact
that alcohol withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe alcohol
use disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild alcohol use disorder with alco-
hol withdrawal.

Other Alcohol-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other alcohol-induced disorders, such as alcohol-
induced anxiety disorder or alcohol-induced sleep disorder, when the symptoms are
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention from intoxication or
withdrawal.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **323**

Unspecified alcohol-related disorder can be diagnosed when symptoms that cause
clinically significant distress or functional impairment do not meet full criteria for
other disorders in this diagnostic class.

CAFFEINE-RELATED DISORDERS

Caffeine is one of the most commonly used psychoactive substances in the world.
Coffee is one of the most potent sources of caffeine, although certain “energy” drinks
may have more caffeine per ounce than coffee. Tea, soft drinks, and chocolate have
less caffeine. Caffeine is also found in nonprescription products such as those for
headaches.
Available scientific evidence supports the diagnoses of both caffeine intoxication
and caffeine withdrawal. Some caffeine users, however, appear to display symptoms
consistent with problematic use. Because data are not available at this time to deter-
mine the clinical significance of or scientific foundation for a caffeine use disorder,
proposed criteria for caffeine use disorder are included in DSM-5 Section III to facili-
tate research (see Chapter 22, “Conditions for Further Study”).

Caffeine Intoxication

Essential features of caffeine intoxication are recent consumption of caffeine and five
or more symptoms that develop during or shortly after caffeine use. Symptoms that
can appear following the ingestion of as little as 200 mg of caffeine (i.e., 1–2 cups of
coffee) per day include restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face,
diuresis, and gastrointestinal complaints. More severe symptoms, such as muscle
twitching, rambling flow of thought or speech, tachycardia, periods of inexhaustibil-
ity, and psychomotor agitation, generally appear at levels of more than 1 g/day. Caf-
feine intoxication may not occur despite a high caffeine intake, however, because of
the development of tolerance in some persons. For this diagnosis, the symptoms must
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning.
Prevalence of the disorder is unclear, but research suggests that about 7% of indi-
viduals in the general population experience five or more symptoms along with func-
tional impairment consistent with the diagnosis of caffeine intoxication. Symptoms
usually remit within the first day or so and do not have any known long-lasting con-
sequences.

Diagnostic Criteria for Caffeine Intoxication **305.90 (F15.929)**

A. Recent consumption of caffeine (typically a high dose well in excess of 250 mg).
B. Five (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly after,
caffeine use:

1. Restlessness.


**324** DSM-5 Guidebook

2. Nervousness.
3. Excitement.
4. Insomnia.
5. Flushed face.
6. Diuresis.
    7. Gastrointestinal disturbance.
8. Muscle twitching.
9. Rambling flow of thought and speech.
10. Tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia.
11. Periods of inexhaustibility.
12. Psychomotor agitation.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another sub-
stance.

Caffeine Withdrawal

Caffeine withdrawal is new to DSM-5. The diagnosis was included in DSM-IV’s Appen-
dix B, “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study,” to encourage further re-
search. The major reason it was not previously included as a full-fledged disorder is
that the syndrome was not considered severe enough to warrant clinical attention. Re-
search has since accumulated to show that caffeine withdrawal can produce distress
and impairment. The severity of symptoms can vary from mild to extreme. Overall,
rates of functional impairment vary from about 10% to as high as 55%. Several lines
of evidence indicate that repeated caffeine use can produce a physical dependence state
that impairs the user ’s ability to control caffeine use.
Because caffeine is often integrated into social customs and daily rituals, caffeine con-
sumers may be unaware of their physical dependence on caffeine. Thus, withdrawal
symptoms can be unexpected and misattributed to other causes. Furthermore, with-
drawal symptoms may occur when individuals are required to abstain from foods and
beverages prior to medical procedures, or when a caffeine dose is missed because of a
change in routine. The probability and severity of withdrawal symptoms are generally
related to usual daily caffeine dose, but there is a large variability among (and within)
individuals in the incidence, severity, and time course of withdrawal.

Diagnostic Criteria for Caffeine Withdrawal **292.0 (F15.93)**

A. Prolonged daily use of caffeine.
B. Abrupt cessation of or reduction in caffeine use, followed within 24 hours by three
(or more) of the following signs or symptoms:


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **325**

1. Headache.
2. Marked fatigue or drowsiness.
3. Dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability.
4. Difficulty concentrating.
5. Flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or muscle pain/stiffness).

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not associated with the physiological effects of another
medical condition (e.g., migraine, viral illness) and are not better explained by an-
other mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

Other Caffeine-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other caffeine-induced disorders, such as caffeine-
induced anxiety disorder and caffeine-induced sleep disorder, instead of caffeine in-
toxication or caffeine withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to
warrant independent clinical attention. Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified
caffeine-related disorder if they have symptoms characteristic of a caffeine-related
disorder that are not classifiable as caffeine intoxication, caffeine withdrawal, or a caf-
feine-induced disorder.

CANNABIS-RELATED DISORDERS

Cannabis-related disorders may result from use of _Cannabis sativa,_ commonly re-
ferred to as marijuana, weed, pot, herb, grass, reefer, and so on. The concentration ex-
tract from cannabis (hashish) is also commonly used. _Cannabis_ is a generic term and also
refers to other forms, including synthetic cannabinoid compounds. Synthetic oral for-
mulations are available by prescription for medical indications in some areas. The pri-
mary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-
THC). Cannabis has diverse effects on the brain, prominent among which are actions
on CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors found throughout the central nervous system.
Cannabis that is generally available varies greatly in potency. Although cannabis is
more commonly smoked, it is sometimes ingested orally after being mixed into food.
Also, devices have been developed in which cannabis is “vaporized.” A new disorder
listed in DSM-5 is cannabis withdrawal.

Cannabis Use Disorder

People who regularly use cannabis can develop all the general diagnostic features of
a substance use disorder. Cannabis use disorder may occur by itself, but it frequently
occurs along with use of other substances, such as alcohol, cocaine, and opioids. Peo-
ple who abuse multiple types of substances may minimize the impact of symptoms
related to cannabis. Pharmacological and behavioral tolerance to most of the effects


**326** DSM-5 Guidebook

of cannabis have been reported in people who use the drug chronically. Tolerance is
lost when cannabis use is discontinued for a significant period of time. Abrupt cessa-
tion of daily or near-daily use can result in withdrawal symptoms such as irritability,
anger, anxiety, depressed mood, restlessness, and sleep difficulty.
People with a cannabis use disorder may use cannabis throughout the day for pe-
riods of months or years and may spend many hours per day under its influence. Oth-
ers may use less frequently but still experience recurrent use-related problems. Use of
cannabis at home may lead to arguments with spouses or parents, and its use in the
presence of children can adversely impact family functioning. Use of cannabis on the
job or while working at a job that requires drug testing can be a sign of a cannabis use
disorder. Those who continue using despite knowledge of physical or psychological
problems show evidence of a disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of cannabis use leading to clinically significant impairment or
distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1. Cannabis is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was in-
    tended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control cannabis
    use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain cannabis, use canna-
    bis, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis.
5. Recurrent cannabis use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,
    school, or home.
6. Continued cannabis use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-
    sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of cannabis.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced
because of cannabis use.
8. Recurrent cannabis use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.
9. Cannabis use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
    physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated
    by cannabis.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of cannabis to achieve intoxication
or desired effect.
b. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of cannabis.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for cannabis (refer to Criteria A and
B of the criteria set for cannabis withdrawal).
b. Cannabis (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid with-
drawal symptoms.

tion, cannabis withdrawal, or another cannabis-induced mental disorder is also present,
do not use the codes below for cannabis use disorder. Instead, the comorbid cannabis
use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the cannabis-induced disorder code
(see the coding note for cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or a specific can-
nabis-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid cannabis-induced
anxiety disorder and cannabis use disorder, only the cannabis-induced anxiety disorder
code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid cannabis use dis-
order is mild, moderate, or severe: F12.180 for mild cannabis use disorder with canna-

**304.30 (F12.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.30 (F12.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Cannabis Intoxication

The essential feature of cannabis intoxication is the presence of clinically significant
problematic behavioral or psychological changes that develop during or shortly after
cannabis use. Intoxication usually begins with a “high,” followed by symptoms that
include euphoria with inappropriate laughter and grandiosity, sedation, lethargy, im-
pairment in short-term memory, difficulty carrying out complex mental processes,
and impaired judgment. Occasionally, anxiety, dysphoria, or social withdrawal may
occur. These effects are accompanied by two or more of the following physical signs,
developing within 2 hours of cannabis use: conjunctival injection, increased appetite,
dry mouth, and tachycardia.
Intoxication develops within minutes if cannabis is smoked but may take a few
hours to develop if orally ingested. The effects usually last 3–4 hours, the duration be-
ing somewhat longer when the substance is ingested orally.


**328** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Cannabis Intoxication

A. Recent use of cannabis.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., im-
paired motor coordination, euphoria, anxiety, sensation of slowed time, impaired
judgment, social withdrawal) that developed during, or shortly after, cannabis use.
C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing within 2 hours of can-
nabis use:

1. Conjunctival injection.
2. Increased appetite.
3. Dry mouth.
4. Tachycardia.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another sub-
stance.

Specify if:
**With perceptual disturbances:** Hallucinations with intact reality testing or audi-
tory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
or not there is a comorbid cannabis use disorder and whether or not there are percep-
tual disturbances.

```
For cannabis intoxication, without perceptual disturbances: If a mild canna-
bis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.129, and if a moderate
or severe cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.229. If
there is no comorbid cannabis use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F12.929.
For cannabis intoxication, with perceptual disturbances: If a mild cannabis
use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.122, and if a moderate or
severe cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.222. If
there is no comorbid cannabis use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F12.922.
```
Cannabis Withdrawal

Research on cannabis withdrawal conducted since the publication of DSM-IV clearly
supports its inclusion in DSM-5. Studies have shown that the syndrome can be reli-
ably identified and that it has a time course typical of other substance withdrawal
syndromes. Nonhuman and human laboratory studies provide clear evidence of the
pharmacological specificity of the withdrawal syndrome. Furthermore, research sug-
gests that the syndrome is not rare.
Evidence also shows that the syndrome is clinically important. Cannabis users re-
port using cannabis to relieve withdrawal symptoms, suggesting that withdrawal
might contribute to ongoing abuse. A substantial proportion of adults and adoles-
cents in treatment for cannabis use admit to moderate to severe withdrawal symp-


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **329**

toms, and report that these symptoms make cessation more difficult. People living
with cannabis users observe significant withdrawal effects, suggesting that such symp-
toms are disruptive to daily living.

Diagnostic Criteria for Cannabis Withdrawal **292.0 (F12.288)**

A. Cessation of cannabis use that has been heavy and prolonged (i.e., usually daily
or almost daily use over a period of at least a few months).
B. Three (or more) of the following signs and symptoms develop within approximately
1 week after Criterion A:

1. Irritability, anger, or aggression.
2. Nervousness or anxiety.
3. Sleep difficulty (e.g., insomnia, disturbing dreams).
4. Decreased appetite or weight loss.
5. Restlessness.
6. Depressed mood.
7. At least one of the following physical symptoms causing significant discomfort:
abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors, sweating, fever, chills, or headache.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal
from another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for cannabis with-
drawal is F12.288. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of
a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder, reflecting the fact that cannabis with-
drawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use disor-
der. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild cannabis use disorder with cannabis
withdrawal.

Other Cannabis-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other cannabis-induced disorders, such as cannabis-
induced psychotic disorder, cannabis-induced anxiety disorder, cannabis-induced
sleep disorder, or cannabis intoxication delirium, instead of cannabis intoxication or
cannabis withdrawal when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant indepen-
dent clinical attention. Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified cannabis-related
disorder if they have symptoms characteristic of a cannabis-related disorder that are
not classifiable as cannabis use disorder, cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal,
or a cannabis-induced disorder.

HALLUCINOGEN-RELATED DISORDERS

Phencyclidine and Other Hallucinogen

Use Disorders

Hallucinogens have been used for thousands of years and in multiple cultures. They
include LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), mescaline, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine), and psilocybin. DSM-IV contained separate sections for phency-
clidine and for hallucinogenic drugs. From both clinical and pharmacological per-
spectives, however, phencyclidine is a drug of abuse with hallucinogenic properties.
For that reason, DSM-5 has included phencyclidine in the clinically similar but phar-
macologically heterogeneous category of hallucinogens. All drugs in this category
produce hallucinations, but by different mechanisms.

Diagnostic Criteria for Phencyclidine Use Disorder

A. A pattern of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar substance) use leading
to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period:

1. Phencyclidine is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was
    intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control phen-
cyclidine use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain phencyclidine, use
the phencyclidine, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use phencyclidine.
5. Recurrent phencyclidine use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at
work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work or poor work perfor-
mance related to phencyclidine use; phencyclidine-related absences, suspen-
sions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household).
6. Continued phencyclidine use despite having persistent or recurrent social or in-
terpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the phencyclidine
(e.g., arguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication; physical
fights).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
duced because of phencyclidine use.
8. Recurrent phencyclidine use in situations in which it is physically hazardous
(e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by a phen-
cyclidine). 
9. Phencyclidine use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or re-
current physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by the phencyclidine.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **331**

10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
    a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the phencyclidine to achieve in-
       toxication or desired effect.
    b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
       phencyclidine.

**Note:** Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established for phencyclidines, and so
this criterion does not apply. (Withdrawal from phencyclidines has been reported in an-
imals but not documented in human users.)

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for phencyclidine use disorder were previous-
ly met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine use disorder have been met for at
least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4,
“Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the phencyclidine,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for phencyclidine use disorder were pre-
viously met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine use disorder have been met at any
time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4,
“Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the phencyclidine,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to phencyclidines is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a phencyclidine in-
toxication or another phencyclidine-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use
the codes below for phencyclidine use disorder. Instead, the comorbid phencyclidine
use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the phencyclidine-induced disorder code
(see the coding note for phencyclidine intoxication or a specific phencyclidine-induced
mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid phencyclidine-induced psychotic dis-
order, only the phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder code is given, with the 4th char-
acter indicating whether the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is mild, moderate, or
severe: F16.159 for mild phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced psychot-
ic disorder or F16.259 for a moderate or severe phencyclidine use disorder with phency-
clidine-induced psychotic disorder.
Specify current severity:

**304.60 (F16.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.60 (F16.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Diagnostic Criteria for Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine) use leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the fol-
lowing, occurring within a 12-month period:

1. The hallucinogen is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than
    was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control hal-
    lucinogen use.


**332** DSM-5 Guidebook

3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the hallucinogen,
    use the hallucinogen, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen.
5. Recurrent hallucinogen use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations
    at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work or poor work per-
    formance related to hallucinogen use; hallucinogen-related absences, suspen-
    sions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household).
6. Continued hallucinogen use despite having persistent or recurrent social or inter-
personal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the hallucinogen (e.g.,
arguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication; physical fights).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
duced because of hallucinogen use.
8. Recurrent hallucinogen use in situations in which it is physically hazard-
    ous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by the
    hallucinogen).
9. Hallucinogen use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or re-
    current physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
    exacerbated by the hallucinogen.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the hallucinogen to achieve in-
toxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
hallucinogen.

**Note:** Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established for hallucinogens, and so
this criterion does not apply.

Specify **the particular hallucinogen.**

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder were pre-
viously met, none of the criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder have been met
for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion
A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder were
previously met, none of the criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder have been
met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Cri-
terion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to hallucinogens is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a hallucinogen intox-
ication or another hallucinogen-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the
codes below for hallucinogen use disorder. Instead, the comorbid hallucinogen use dis-
order is indicated in the 4th character of the hallucinogen-induced disorder code (see the
coding note for hallucinogen intoxication or specific hallucinogen-induced mental disor-
der). For example, if there is comorbid hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder and hal-
lucinogen use disorder, only the hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder code is given,
with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid hallucinogen use disorder is mild,

Phencyclidine Intoxication and

Other Hallucinogen Intoxication

Phencyclidine intoxication and other hallucinogen intoxication reflect the clinically
significant behavioral or psychological changes that occur shortly after ingestion of a
substance. Depending on the specific agent, intoxication lasts minutes to hours. In-
toxication with phencyclidine differs from that with other hallucinogens. With phen-
cyclidine intoxication, the individual may experience nystagmus, seizures, ataxia,
dysarthria, hypertension, and hyperacusis. By contrast, individuals with other hallu-
cinogen intoxication experience tachycardia, blurred vision, tremors, and sweating,
among other symptoms. Behavioral changes such as belligerence, assaultiveness, un-
predictability, and psychomotor agitation occur with phencyclidine intoxication,
whereas other hallucinogen intoxication may present with marked anxiety or de-
pression, ideas of reference, fear of “losing one’s mind,” and paranoid ideation. Ad-
ditionally, other hallucinogen intoxication may result in perceptual changes such as
depersonalization, derealization, hallucinations, and synesthesias that occur during,
or shortly after, hallucinogen use.
Intoxication with either phencyclidine or other hallucinogens should be differen-
tiated from intoxication with stimulants, anticholinergics, inhalants, or other drugs of
abuse. Toxicological tests can be useful in making this distinction. Other conditions to
consider include mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and withdrawal from other
substances. The perceptual disturbances and impaired judgment associated with hal-
lucinogen intoxication can result in injuries or fatalities from motor vehicle accidents,
physical fights, or unintentional self-injury.

Diagnostic Criteria for Phencyclidine Intoxication

A. Recent use of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar substance).
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral changes (e.g., belligerence, assaul-
tiveness, impulsiveness, unpredictability, psychomotor agitation, impaired judg-
ment) that developed during, or shortly after, phencyclidine use.
C. Within 1 hour, two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms:

```
Note: When the drug is smoked, “snorted,” or used intravenously, the onset may
be particularly rapid.
```

**334** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. Vertical or horizontal nystagmus.
2. Hypertension or tachycardia.
3. Numbness or diminished responsiveness to pain.
4. Ataxia.
5. Dysarthria.
6. Muscle rigidity.
    7. Seizures or coma.
8. Hyperacusis.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another sub-
stance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
there is a comorbid phencyclidine use disorder. If a mild phencyclidine use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.129,** and if a moderate or severe phencyclidine
use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.229.** If there is no comorbid
phencyclidine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.929.**

Diagnostic Criteria for Other Hallucinogen Intoxication

A. Recent use of a hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine).
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., marked
anxiety or depression, ideas of reference, fear of “losing one’s mind,” paranoid ideation,
impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, hallucinogen use.
C. Perceptual changes occurring in a state of full wakefulness and alertness (e.g.,
subjective intensification of perceptions, depersonalization, derealization, illusions,
hallucinations, synesthesias) that developed during, or shortly after, hallucinogen
use.
D. Two (or more) of the following signs developing during, or shortly after, hallucino-
gen use:

1. Pupillary dilation.
2. Tachycardia.
3. Sweating.
4. Palpitations.
5. Blurring of vision.
6. Tremors.
7. Incoordination.

E. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether there is a comorbid hallucinogen use disorder. If a mild hallucinogen use dis-
order is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.129,** and if a moderate or severe hal-


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **335**

lucinogen use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.229.** If there is no
comorbid hallucinogen use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.929.**

Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder

Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder involves the reexperiencing of one or
more of the perceptual symptoms that were experienced while intoxicated with the
hallucinogen.

Diagnostic Criteria for Hallucinogen Persisting
Perception Disorder **292.89 (F16.983)**

A. Following cessation of use of a hallucinogen, the reexperiencing of one or more of
the perceptual symptoms that were experienced while intoxicated with the halluci-
nogen (e.g., geometric hallucinations, false perceptions of movement in the periph-
eral visual fields, flashes of color, intensified colors, trails of images of moving
objects, positive afterimages, halos around objects, macropsia and micropsia).
B. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., anatomical
lesions and infections of the brain, visual epilepsies) and are not better explained
by another mental disorder (e.g., delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, schizo-
phrenia) or hypnopompic hallucinations.

Other Phencyclidine- and Other Hallucinogen-

Induced Disorders

Individuals are diagnosed with other phencyclidine- or other hallucinogen-induced dis-
order, such as phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, when the symptoms are suf-
ficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Phencyclidine- and Unspecified

Hallucinogen-Related Disorders

Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified phencyclidine- or unspecified hallucino-
gen-related disorder if they have symptoms characteristic of a phencyclidine- or other
hallucinogen-related disorder that are not classifiable as phencyclidine or other hal-
lucinogen use disorder, intoxication, withdrawal, or induced disorder.


**336** DSM-5 Guidebook

INHALANT-RELATED DISORDERS

Inhalant Use Disorder

Paint thinner, airplane glue, and gasoline are just a few of the inhalants that are com-
monplace. They enter the bloodstream quickly, have rapid onset of action, and can
damage the central nervous system, kidneys, and liver.
People who regularly use hydrocarbon-based inhalants may develop most of the
diagnostic features of a substance use disorder. One exception is withdrawal. Avail-
able scientific evidence does not support the diagnosis of inhalant withdrawal as a
disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Inhalant Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of use of a hydrocarbon-based inhalant substance leading
to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period:

1. The inhalant substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period
    than was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use
of the inhalant substance.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the inhalant sub-
stance, use it, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance.
5. Recurrent use of the inhalant substance resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home.
6. Continued use of the inhalant substance despite having persistent or recurrent
social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of its
use.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
    duced because of use of the inhalant substance.
8. Recurrent use of the inhalant substance in situations in which it is physically
hazardous.
9. Use of the inhalant substance is continued despite knowledge of having a per-
sistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been
caused or exacerbated by the substance.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the inhalant substance to
achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
inhalant substance.

Specify **the particular inhalant:** When possible, the particular substance involved
should be named (e.g., “solvent use disorder”).


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **337**

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for inhalant use disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria for inhalant use disorder have been met for at least 3 months
but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for inhalant use disorder were previous-
ly met, none of the criteria for inhalant use disorder have been met at any time dur-
ing a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving,
or a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to inhalant substances is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an inhalant intoxi-
cation or another inhalant-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the
codes below for inhalant use disorder. Instead, the comorbid inhalant use disorder is
indicated in the 4th character of the inhalant-induced disorder code (see the coding
note for inhalant intoxication or a specific inhalant-induced mental disorder). For ex-
ample, if there is comorbid inhalant-induced depressive disorder and inhalant use dis-
order, only the inhalant-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character
indicating whether the comorbid inhalant use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F18.14 for mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced depressive disorder or
F18.24 for a moderate or severe inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced depressive
disorder.

Specify current severity:
**305.90 (F18.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**304.60 (F18.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.60 (F18.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Inhalant Intoxication

Inhalant intoxication is a clinically significant disorder that develops during, or
immediately after, intended or unintended inhalation of an inhalant substance. The
intoxication clears within a few minutes to a few hours after exposure ends. Impair-
ment from intoxication may have serious consequences with regard to job-related and
social functioning. It may also lead to traffic accidents or unintentional self-injuries.
Use of inhaled substances in a closed container, such as a plastic bag, may lead to un-
consciousness, anoxia, and death.

Diagnostic Criteria for Inhalant Intoxication

A. Recent intended or unintended short-term, high-dose exposure to inhalant sub-
stances, including volatile hydrocarbons such as toluene or gasoline.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., bel-
ligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired judgment) that developed during, or
shortly after, exposure to inhalants.


**338** DSM-5 Guidebook

C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly af-
ter, inhalant use or exposure:

1. Dizziness.
2. Nystagmus.
3. Incoordination.
4. Slurred speech.
5. Unsteady gait.
6. Lethargy.
    7. Depressed reflexes.
8. Psychomotor retardation.
9. Tremor.
10. Generalized muscle weakness.
11. Blurred vision or diplopia.
12. Stupor or coma.
13. Euphoria.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another sub-
stance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
there is a comorbid inhalant use disorder. If a mild inhalant use disorder is comorbid,
the ICD-10-CM code is **F18.129,** and if a moderate or severe inhalant use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F18.229.** If there is no comorbid inhalant use disor-
der, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F18.929.**

Other Inhalant-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Inhalant-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other inhalant-induced disorders, such as inhalant-
induced psychotic disorder, when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant in-
dependent clinical attention.
Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified inhalant-related disorder if they have
symptoms characteristic of an inhalant-related disorder that are not classifiable as in-
halant use disorder, intoxication, or induced disorder.

OPIOID-RELATED DISORDERS

The opioids include natural and synthetic substances with morphine-like actions that
are full agonists to the  opioid receptor. Medications such as buprenorphine that have
both opiate agonist and antagonist effects are also included in this class. Opioids are pre-
scribed as analgesics, anesthetics, antidiarrheal agents, and cough suppressants. After
heroin, opium is the most widely consumed illegal opiate in the world. In the United
States, the nonmedical use of prescription opioids is a significant problem. Opioid users
have a high likelihood of developing opioid use disorders and have an increased risk for
HIV, as well as hepatitis B and C viruses; mortality rates are excessive.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **339**

Opioid Use Disorder

Opioid use disorder includes signs and symptoms that reflect compulsive, prolonged
self-administration of opioid substances that are used for no legitimate medical pur-
poses or that are used in doses that are greatly in excess of the amount needed to treat
a medical condition requiring opioid treatment. Individuals with opioid use disorder
tend to develop regular patterns of compulsive drug use, such that daily activities are
planned around obtaining and administering the drugs. Opioids are usually pur-
chased on the illegal market but may also be obtained from physicians by falsifying or
exaggerating general medical problems or by receiving simultaneous prescriptions
from several physicians (“doctor shopping”). Most individuals with this disorder have
significant levels of tolerance and experience withdrawal on abrupt discontinuation
of opioid substances.
Opioid use disorder can be associated with a history of drug-related crimes, usually
related to attempts to obtain the drugs. Among health care professionals and individu-
als with ready access to controlled substances, there is often a different pattern of illegal
activities, which might involve problems with state licensing boards. Marital difficul-
ties and unemployment or other work-related problems are also associated with the
disorder.
Many people with opioid use disorder are treated with agonist, partial agonist, or
agonist/antagonist medication such as methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone.
These individuals may have a presentation that meets none of the criteria for opioid
use disorder (except perhaps tolerance or withdrawal). For these individuals, the ad-
ditional specifier “on maintenance therapy” would be merited.

Diagnostic Criteria for Opioid Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or
distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1. Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was in-
    tended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control opioid
    use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the opioid, use the
    opioid, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids.
5. Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,
    school, or home.
6. Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-
    sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of opioids.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
duced because of opioid use.
8. Recurrent opioid use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.


**340** DSM-5 Guidebook

9. Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
    physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacer-
    bated by the substance.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve intoxication or
desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of an
opioid.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking opioids solely
under appropriate medical supervision.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome (refer to Criteria A and B of
the criteria set for opioid withdrawal).
b. Opioids (or a closely related substance) are taken to relieve or avoid with-
drawal symptoms.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those individuals taking opi-
oids solely under appropriate medical supervision.

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for opioid use disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but
for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use opioids,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for opioid use disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met at any time during
a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or
a strong desire or urge to use opioids,” may be met).

Specify if:
**On maintenance therapy:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is tak-
ing a prescribed agonist medication such as methadone or buprenorphine and
none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for that class of medica-
tion (except tolerance to, or withdrawal from, the agonist). This category also applies
to those individuals being maintained on a partial agonist, an agonist/antagonist,
or a full antagonist such as oral naltrexone or depot naltrexone.
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to opioids is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an opioid intoxica-
tion, opioid withdrawal, or another opioid-induced mental disorder is also present, do
not use the codes below for opioid use disorder. Instead, the comorbid opioid use dis-
order is indicated in the 4th character of the opioid-induced disorder code (see the
coding note for opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or a specific opioid-induced
mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid opioid-induced depressive disorder
and opioid use disorder, only the opioid-induced depressive disorder code is given,
with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid opioid use disorder is mild, mod-
erate, or severe: F11.14 for mild opioid use disorder with opioid-induced depressive
disorder or F11.24 for a moderate or severe opioid use disorder with opioid-induced
depressive disorder.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **341**

Specify current severity:
**305.50 (F11.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**304.00 (F11.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.00 (F11.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Opioid Intoxication

The essential feature of opioid intoxication is the presence of abnormal behavioral or
psychological changes that develop during or shortly after opioid use. Intoxication is
accompanied by pupillary constriction and at least one of the following signs: drows-
iness, slurred speech, or impairment in attention or memory. Drowsiness may progress
to coma. People with opioid intoxication have demonstrated inattention to their en-
vironment, even to the point of ignoring potentially harmful events. The symptoms
are not explained by another medical condition or another mental disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Opioid Intoxication

A. Recent use of an opioid.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., initial
euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria, psychomotor agitation or retardation, im-
paired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, opioid use.
C. Pupillary constriction (or pupillary dilation due to anoxia from severe overdose)
and one (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly
after, opioid use:

1. Drowsiness or coma.
2. Slurred speech.
3. Impairment in attention or memory.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance.

Specify if:
**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier may be noted in the rare instance
in which hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illu-
sions occur in the absence of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether or not there is a comorbid opioid use disorder and whether or not there are
perceptual disturbances.

```
For opioid intoxication without perceptual disturbances: If a mild opioid use
disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.129, and if a moderate or severe
opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.229. If there is no co-
morbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F11.929.
For opioid intoxication with perceptual disturbances: If a mild opioid use dis-
order is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.122, and if a moderate or severe
```

**342** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.222. If there is no co-
morbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F11.922.
```
Opioid Withdrawal

The essential feature of opioid withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal
syndrome that develops after the cessation of or reduction in opioid use that has been
heavy and prolonged. The syndrome can also be precipitated by administration of an
opioid antagonist, such as naltrexone, after a period of opioid use. Symptoms include
complaints of anxiety, restlessness, and muscle aches, along with irritability and in-
creased sensitivity to pain. Other symptoms soon develop, ranging from cognitive
(dysphoric mood) to physical (e.g., nausea and vomiting, lacrimation or rhinorrhea,
piloerection, sweating) symptoms. Withdrawal may begin within 6–12 hours after the
last dose of a short-acting drug such as heroin but within 2–4 days in the case of lon-
ger-acting drugs such as methadone.

Diagnostic Criteria for Opioid Withdrawal **292.0 (F11.23)**

A. Presence of either of the following:

1. Cessation of (or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged
    (i.e., several weeks or longer).
2. Administration of an opioid antagonist after a period of opioid use.

B. Three (or more) of the following developing within minutes to several days after Crite-
rion A:

1. Dysphoric mood.
2. Nausea or vomiting.
3. Muscle aches.
4. Lacrimation or rhinorrhea.
5. Pupillary dilation, piloerection, or sweating.
6. Diarrhea.
7. Yawning.
8. Fever.
9. Insomnia.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or with-
drawal from another substance.
**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for opioid withdraw-
al is F11.23. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a mod-
erate or severe opioid use disorder, reflecting the fact that opioid withdrawal can only
occur in the presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder. It is not permissible
to code a comorbid mild opioid use disorder with opioid withdrawal.

Other Opioid-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Opioid-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other opioid-induced disorders, such as opioid-
induced psychotic disorder, when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant in-
dependent clinical attention.
Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified opioid-related disorder if they have
symptoms characteristic of an opioid-related disorder that are not classifiable as opi-
oid use disorder, intoxication, withdrawal, or induced disorder.

SEDATIVE-, HYPNOTIC-, OR ANXIOLYTIC-

RELATED DISORDERS

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances include benzodiazepines, benzodiaze-
pine-like drugs, carbamates, barbiturates, and barbiturate-like hypnotics. This class
includes all prescription sleeping medications and almost all prescription antianxiety
medications. Nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety agents (e.g., buspirone) are not in-
cluded in this class because they do not appear to be associated with significant mis-
use. At high doses, these drugs can be lethal, particularly when mixed with alcohol,
although the lethal dose varies considerably among the specific drugs. Sedative, hyp-
notic, and anxiolytic substances are available both by prescription and on the black
market. Very significant levels of tolerance to and withdrawal from these drugs can de-
velop. The social and interpersonal consequences of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder mimic those of alcohol in terms of the potential for disinhibited behavior.
Accidents, interpersonal difficulties, and interference with work or school perfor-
mance are all common.

Diagnostic Criteria for Sedative, Hypnotic, or
Anxiolytic Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following,
occurring within a 12-month period:

1. Sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are often taken in larger amounts or over a
    longer period than was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control sed-
    ative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic; use the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic; or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.


**344** DSM-5 Guidebook

5. Recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use resulting in a failure to fulfill ma-
    jor role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work
    or poor work performance related to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use; seda-
    tive-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions
    from school; neglect of children or household).
6. Continued sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use despite having persistent or re-
    current social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects
    of sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics (e.g., arguments with a spouse about
    consequences of intoxication; physical fights).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced
because of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.
8. Recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use in situations in which it is physi-
    cally hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when im-
    paired by sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use).
9. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use is continued despite knowledge of having
    a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have
    been caused or exacerbated by the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxio-
lytic to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for individuals taking sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical supervision.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for sedatives, hypnotics, or anxio-
lytics (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal).
b. Sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics (or a closely related substance, such as
alcohol) are taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for individuals taking sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical supervision.

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use dis-
order were previously met, none of the criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with
the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sed-
ative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxio-
lytic use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer
(with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics is restricted.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **345**

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a sedative, hypnot-
ic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or another
sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use
the codes below for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Instead the comor-
bid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the
sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorder (see the coding note for sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or spe-
cific sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorder). For example, if there
is comorbid sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder and seda-
tive, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, only the sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-
induced depressive disorder code is given with the 4th character indicating whether
the comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F13.14 for mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative-, hypnotic-,
or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder or F13.24 for a moderate or severe sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced de-
pressive disorder.
Specify current severity:
**305.40 (F13.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**304.10 (F13.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.10 (F13.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication

The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication is the presence
of clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes that de-
velop during or shortly after use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drug. As occurs
with other brain depressants, these behaviors may be accompanied by slurred
speech, unsteady gait, nystagmus, memory or attentional problems, levels of incoor-
dination that can interfere with driving, and stupor or coma. Memory impairment is
a prominent feature and is most often characterized by an anterograde amnesia that
resembles “alcoholic blackouts.”

Diagnostic Criteria for Sedative, Hypnotic, or
Anxiolytic Intoxication

A. Recent use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.
B. Clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., inap-
propriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment) that de-
veloped during, or shortly after, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.
C. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly af-
ter, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use:

1. Slurred speech.
2. Incoordination.


**346** DSM-5 Guidebook

3. Unsteady gait.
4. Nystagmus.
5. Impairment in cognition (e.g., attention, memory).
6. Stupor or coma.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether there is a comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. If a mild
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
**F13.129,** and if a moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.229.** If there is no comorbid sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.929.**

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal

The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is the presence
of a characteristic syndrome that develops after a marked cessation of (or decrease in)
intake after several weeks or more of regular use. This syndrome is characterized by
two or more symptoms that include, for example, autonomic hyperactivity, tremors,
insomnia, anxiety, nausea sometimes accompanied by vomiting, and psychomotor
agitation. Grand mal seizures occur in perhaps 20%–30% of people undergoing un-
treated withdrawal from these substances. In severe withdrawal, visual, tactile, or au-
ditory hallucinations or illusions can occur, but are usually in the context of a delirium.
The timing and severity of the syndrome will differ depending on specific substances
and their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The time course of the syndrome is generally predicted by the half-life of the sub-
stance. Medications whose actions typically last about 10 hours or less produce with-
drawal symptoms within 6–8 hours after levels in the blood begin decreasing. Intensity
peaks on the second day, and symptoms improve markedly by day 4 or 5. For sub-
stances with longer half-lives, symptoms may not develop for more than 1 week, peak
in intensity during the second week, and decrease in intensity during the third or
fourth week. Additional long-term symptoms can persist at a much lower level of in-
tensity for several months. Lingering withdrawal symptoms (e.g., anxiety, moodi-
ness, trouble sleeping) can be mistaken for non-substance-induced anxiety or
depressive disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Sedative, Hypnotic, or
Anxiolytic Withdrawal

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use that has been
prolonged.
B. Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours to a few days after


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **347**

```
the cessation of (or reduction in) sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use described in
Criterion A:
```
1. Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or pulse rate greater than 100 bpm).
2. Hand tremor.
3. Insomnia.
4. Nausea or vomiting.
5. Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions.
6. Psychomotor agitation.
7. Anxiety.
8. Grand mal seizures.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or with-
drawal from another substance.

Specify if:
**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier may be noted when hallucinations with
intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a de-
lirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.0.** The ICD-10-CM code for sedative, hyp-
notic, or anxiolytic withdrawal depends on whether or not there is a comorbid moder-
ate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and whether or not there
are perceptual disturbances. For sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal without
perceptual disturbances, the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.239.** For sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal with perceptual disturbances, the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.232.**
Note that the ICD-10-CM codes indicate the comorbid presence of a moderate or se-
vere sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, reflecting the fact that sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or
severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. It is not permissible to code a
comorbid mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic withdrawal.

Other Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-

Induced Disorders and Unspecified Sedative-,

Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders,
such as sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced psychotic disorder, when the symp-
toms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.
Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-
related disorder if they have symptoms characteristic of a sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-related disorder that are not classifiable as sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxio-
lytic use disorder, intoxication, withdrawal, or induced disorder.


**348** DSM-5 Guidebook

STIMULANT-RELATED DISORDERS

Stimulant-related disorders result from use of plant-derived stimulants such as cocaine;
amphetamine and amphetamine-like drugs; and other stimulants, such as methylphe-
nidate, that are structurally different from amphetamine but have action similar to am-
phetamine-type stimulants. Although cocaine and amphetamine-like stimulant drugs
are different in some characteristics, such as their mechanisms of action, the clinical pre-
sentation related to these compounds is largely similar. Most of the effects of amphet-
amine-type stimulants are similar to those of cocaine, but there are some distinctions.
For example, unlike cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants do not have local anesthetic
activity, and their risk for inducing certain medical conditions such as cardiac arrhyth-
mias and seizures may be lower. The psychoactive effects of most amphetamine-like
substances last longer than the effects of a dose of cocaine, and the peripheral sympa-
thomimetic effects may be more potent. Cocaine and methamphetamine are almost al-
ways purchased illicitly, but amphetamine-type stimulants may also be obtained
legally by prescription for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
narcolepsy, and other medical conditions.
Drugs in the amphetamine and cocaine categories have in common the produc-
tion of intense stimulation in the user. This stimulation is the result of increases in bio-
genic amines in the central nervous system. The exact molecular mechanisms vary,
but the results are similar, as is the clinical addiction syndrome for each. Thus, in
DSM-5 all of the stimulant drugs are now described in one stimulant category rather
than separately.

Stimulant Use Disorder

Stimulants have potent euphoric effects, and individuals exposed to cocaine or am-
phetamine-type stimulants can develop a use disorder after using the drug for short
periods of time. Regardless of route of administration, tolerance occurs with repeated
use. Withdrawal symptoms, particularly hypersomnia, increased appetite, and dys-
phoric mood, can be seen and are likely to enhance craving and the likelihood of re-
lapse. People may spend large amounts of money for cocaine and amphetamine-type
stimulants within a short period of time and may also engage in criminal activity to
obtain money for stimulants.

Diagnostic Criteria for Stimulant Use Disorder

A. A pattern of amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant use leading
to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period:

1. The stimulant is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was
    intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control stimulant
use.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **349**

3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the stimulant, use
    the stimulant, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the stimulant.
5. Recurrent stimulant use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at
    work, school, or home.
6. Continued stimulant use despite having persistent or recurrent social or inter-
    personal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the stimulant.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
duced because of stimulant use.
8. Recurrent stimulant use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.
9. Stimulant use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recur-
    rent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or ex-
    acerbated by the stimulant.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the stimulant to achieve intoxica-
tion or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
stimulant.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking stimulant med-
ications solely under appropriate medical supervision, such as medications for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or narcolepsy.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the stimulant (refer to Criteria A
and B of the criteria set for stimulant withdrawal).
b. The stimulant (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid
withdrawal symptoms.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking stimulant med-
ications solely under appropriate medical supervision, such as medications for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or narcolepsy.
Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for stimulant use disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder have been met for at least 3 months
but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for stimulant use disorder were previ-
ously met, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder have been met at any time
during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Crav-
ing, or a strong desire or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to stimulants is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an amphetamine
intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or another amphetamine-induced mental dis-
order is also present, do not use the codes below for amphetamine use disorder. In-
stead, the comorbid amphetamine use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the
amphetamine-induced disorder code (see the coding note for amphetamine intoxica-

tion, amphetamine withdrawal, or a specific amphetamine-induced mental disorder).
For example, if there is comorbid amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced de-
pressive disorder and amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder, only the am-
phetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the
4th character indicating whether the comorbid amphetamine-type or other stimulant
use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F15.14 for mild amphetamine-type or other
stimulant use disorder with amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive
disorder or F15.24 for a moderate or severe amphetamine-type or other stimulant use
disorder with amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder. Sim-
ilarly, if there is comorbid cocaine-induced depressive disorder and cocaine use disor-
der, only the cocaine-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character
indicating whether the comorbid cocaine use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F14.14 for mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder or
F14.24 for a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive
disorder.

**304.20 (F14.20)** Cocaine
**304.40 (F15.20)** Other or unspecified stimulant

Stimulant Intoxication

Acute intoxication with high doses of stimulants is associated with increased auto-
nomic activity, perceptual disturbances, behavioral changes (e.g., stereotyped behav-
iors such as picking at skin), and psychological changes (e.g., agitation, aggression).

Diagnostic Criteria for Stimulant Intoxication

A. Recent use of an amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., eu-
phoria or affective blunting; changes in sociability; hypervigilance; interpersonal
sensitivity; anxiety, tension, or anger; stereotyped behaviors; impaired judgment)
that developed during, or shortly after, use of a stimulant.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **351**

C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms, developing during, or shortly
after, stimulant use:

1. Tachycardia or bradycardia.
2. Pupillary dilation.
3. Elevated or lowered blood pressure.
4. Perspiration or chills.
5. Nausea or vomiting.
6. Evidence of weight loss.
7. Psychomotor agitation or retardation.
8. Muscular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhyth-
    mias.
9. Confusion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance.

Specify **the specific intoxicant** (i.e., amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other
stimulant).

Specify if:
**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier may be noted when hallucinations
with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence
of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant; whether there is a co-
morbid amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder; and whether or not
there are perceptual disturbances.

```
For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication, without perceptu-
al disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid,
the ICD-10-CM code is F15.129, and if a moderate or severe amphetamine or other
stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.229. If there is no
comorbid amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code
is F15.929. Similarly, if a mild cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM
code is F14.129, and if a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the
ICD-10-CM code is F14.229. If there is no comorbid cocaine use disorder, then the
ICD-10-CM code is F14.929.
For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication, with perceptual
disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid,
the ICD-10-CM code is F15.122, and if a moderate or severe amphetamine or other

Stimulant Withdrawal

The essential feature of stimulant withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic with-
drawal syndrome, which develops within a few hours after cessation of or reduction in
use of a high-dose stimulant. Use has to have been prolonged. A withdrawal syndrome
is characterized by the development of dysphoric mood accompanied by two or more
of the following physiological changes: fatigue, vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia
or hypersomnia, increased appetite, and psychomotor retardation or agitation. Acute
withdrawal symptoms (a “crash”) can be seen after periods of repetitive high-dose use.
Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or behavior can occur.

Diagnostic Criteria for Stimulant Withdrawal

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) prolonged amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or
other stimulant use.
B. Dysphoric mood and two (or more) of the following physiological changes, devel-
oping within a few hours to several days after Criterion A:

1. Fatigue.
2. Vivid, unpleasant dreams.
3. Insomnia or hypersomnia.
4. Increased appetite.
5. Psychomotor retardation or agitation.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal
from another substance.

Specify **the specific substance that causes the withdrawal syndrome** (i.e., am-
phetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant).

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.0.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant. The ICD-10-CM code for
amphetamine or an other stimulant withdrawal is **F15.23,** and the ICD-10-CM for cocaine
withdrawal is **F14.23.** Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of
a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder, reflecting
the fact that amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal can only occur in the
presence of a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder.
It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant
use disorder with amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **353**

Other Stimulant-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other stimulant-induced disorders, such as stimulant-
induced psychotic disorder, when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant in-
dependent clinical attention.
Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified stimulant-related disorder if they
have symptoms characteristic of a stimulant-related disorder that are not classifiable
as stimulant use disorder, intoxication, withdrawal, or induced disorder.

TOBACCO-RELATED DISORDERS

Tobacco Use Disorder

The relative ability of tobacco products to produce a use disorder correlates with nic-
otine content, the rapidity of absorption, and associated conditioned features (e.g.,
oral gratification). Tobacco use disorder is common among daily cigarette and smoke-
less tobacco users but is uncommon among nondaily tobacco users or among users of
nicotine medications. Tolerance to tobacco is exemplified by the disappearance of
nausea and dizziness after its use is resumed. Cessation of tobacco use can produce a
well-defined withdrawal syndrome. Many people with tobacco use disorder use to-
bacco to relieve or to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The large majority of tobacco users
report craving when they do not smoke for several hours. Spending excessive time us-
ing tobacco can be exemplified by chain-smoking. Smoking within 30 minutes of wak-
ing, smoking daily, and awaking at night to smoke are associated with tobacco use
disorder. Scientific evidence did not support the inclusion in DSM-5 of a tobacco in-
toxication disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Tobacco Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically significant impairment or
distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1. Tobacco is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was in-
    tended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control tobacco
use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain or use tobacco.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco.


**354** DSM-5 Guidebook

5. Recurrent tobacco use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at
    work, school, or home (e.g., interference with work).
6. Continued tobacco use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-
    sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of tobacco (e.g., argu-
    ments with others about tobacco use).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced
because of tobacco use.
8. Recurrent tobacco use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., smok-
    ing in bed).
9. Tobacco use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
    physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacer-
    bated by tobacco.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of tobacco to achieve the desired ef-
fect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of to-
bacco.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for tobacco (refer to Criteria A and
B of the criteria set for tobacco withdrawal).
b. Tobacco (or a closely related substance, such as nicotine) is taken to relieve
or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for tobacco use disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria for tobacco use disorder have been met for at least 3 months
but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use tobacco,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for tobacco use disorder were previous-
ly met, none of the criteria for tobacco use disorder have been met at any time dur-
ing a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving,
or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco,” may be met).

Specify if:
**On maintenance therapy:** The individual is taking a long-term maintenance med-
ication, such as nicotine replacement medication, and no criteria for tobacco use
disorder have been met for that class of medication (except tolerance to, or with-
drawal from, the nicotine replacement medication).
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to tobacco is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a tobacco withdrawal
or tobacco-induced sleep disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for tobacco
use disorder. Instead, the comorbid tobacco use disorder is indicated in the 4th character
of the tobacco-induced disorder code (see the coding note for tobacco withdrawal or to-
bacco-induced sleep disorder). For example, if there is comorbid tobacco-induced sleep
disorder and tobacco use disorder, only the tobacco-induced sleep disorder code is given,
with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid tobacco use disorder is moderate
or severe: F17.208 for moderate or severe tobacco use disorder with tobacco-induced


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **355**

sleep disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder with a
tobacco-induced sleep disorder.
Specify current severity:
**305.1 (Z72.0) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**305.1 (F17.200) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**305.1 (F17.200) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Tobacco Withdrawal

Tobacco withdrawal impairs the ability to stop tobacco use. The symptoms, which oc-
cur 24 hours after abstinence from tobacco, are much more intense among individuals
who smoke cigarettes. This increased intensity is probably due to the more rapid on-
set of symptoms and higher levels of nicotine with cigarette smoking.

Diagnostic Criteria for Tobacco Withdrawal **292.0 (F17.203)**

A. Daily use of tobacco for at least several weeks.
B. Abrupt cessation of tobacco use, or reduction in the amount of tobacco used, fol-
lowed within 24 hours by four (or more) of the following signs or symptoms:

1. Irritability, frustration, or anger.
2. Anxiety.
3. Difficulty concentrating.
4. Increased appetite.
5. Restlessness.
6. Depressed mood.
7. Insomnia.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributed to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal
from another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for tobacco with-
drawal is F17.203. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of
a moderate or severe tobacco use disorder, reflecting the fact that tobacco withdrawal
can only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe tobacco use disorder. It is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder with tobacco withdrawal.

Other Tobacco-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Tobacco-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other tobacco-induced disorders, such as tobacco-
induced sleep disorder, when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant inde-
pendent clinical attention.


**356** DSM-5 Guidebook

Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified tobacco-related disorder if they have
symptoms characteristic of a tobacco-related disorder that are not classifiable as to-
bacco use disorder, withdrawal, or induced disorder.

OTHER (OR UNKNOWN) SUBSTANCE–

RELATED DISORDERS

When the substance or substances used are unknown, the individual is diagnosed with
one of the other (or unknown) substance–related disorders. In addition to diagnoses
for use disorder, intoxication, and withdrawal, two residual categories are available
for other situations: other (or unknown) substance–induced disorders and unspecified
other (or unknown) substance–related disorder.

NON-SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS

Gambling Disorder

Gambling is encountered in almost all cultures throughout recorded history. Although
most individuals gamble responsibly, some become preoccupied with gambling and
experience its multiple negative consequences. For these people, their gambling be-
havior has devastating consequences that impact the individual, his or her family,
and society.
Disordered gambling behavior was first officially recognized in DSM-III, as _path-
ological gambling._ The disorder was categorized as one of the impulse-control disor-
ders not elsewhere classified, along with disorders such as kleptomania, pyromania,
and trichotillomania. In DSM-5, the disorder has been moved to the chapter on sub-
stance use disorders because of consistently high rates of comorbidity, similar presen-
tations of some symptoms, and genetic and physiological overlap. Additionally, the
placement of gambling disorder in the current chapter is likely to improve recognition
of the disorder, especially among substance abusers, who are at high risk for gambling
problems.
The criteria have had only minor changes from DSM-IV. Importantly, the name has
changed from _pathological gambling_ to _gambling disorder,_ mainly to avoid the stigma at-
tached to the word _pathological._ Also, the number of core symptoms required for the di-
agnosis has been reduced.

Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 ( **F63.0** )

A. Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically signif-
icant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more)
of the following in a 12-month period:

1. Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the de-
    sired excitement.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **357**

2. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling.
3. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling.
4. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving
    past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking
    of ways to get money with which to gamble).
5. Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, de-
    pressed).
6. After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (“chasing”
    one’s losses).
7. Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling.
8. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career
    opportunity because of gambling.
9. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused
    by gambling.
B. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode.

Specify if:
**Episodic:** Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms
subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months.
**Persistent:** Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for mul-
tiple years.

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but
for less than 12 months.
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of
12 months or longer.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** 4–5 criteria met.
**Moderate:** 6–7 criteria met.
**Severe:** 8–9 criteria met.

Criterion A

The symptoms set forth mirror those of the substance addictions. Tolerance (needing
to gamble with increasing amounts of money), withdrawal (restlessness or irritability
when cutting back), and compulsive use (preoccupation with gambling, “chasing” of
losses, repeated unsuccessful attempts to control gambling, and gambling as a way of
escaping from problems) are the cardinal features of gambling disorder. The adverse
consequences of addiction are also reflected in the remaining symptoms (lying to oth-
ers, jeopardizing important relationships, and relying on others financially).
The DSM-5 diagnosis requires that four of nine symptoms be endorsed to qualify
for the diagnosis of gambling disorder. This is a change from DSM-IV, in which five
of 10 symptoms were required. DSM-IV Criterion A8 has been eliminated because the
symptom “has committed illegal acts... to finance gambling” has been shown to have


**358** DSM-5 Guidebook

low prevalence; its elimination has little or no effect on prevalence. Also, the threshold
of four symptoms was found to differentiate pathological from nonpathological forms
of gambling.

Criterion B

Individuals with bipolar disorder may engage in multiple forms of impulsive behavior,
including gambling, when hypomanic or manic. The diagnosis of gambling disorder
requires that the gambling behavior not occur exclusively during a manic episode. It
is possible, however, that someone may have both diagnoses, with the gambling
worsening during mood instability, but this would require that the gambling behav-
ior be also independent of manic episodes.

Specifiers

Gambling disorder can be episodic or persistent, and the course of the disorder can vary
by type of gambling as well as life circumstances. For example, an individual who
wagers problematically only on football games may have gambling disorder during
football season and not wager at all, or not wager problematically, throughout the re-
mainder of the year. Gambling disorder may also occur at one or more points in an
individual’s life but be absent during other periods. Alternatively, some individuals
experience chronic gambling disorder throughout all or most of their lives.
Other specifiers, which are used for the other substance use disorders, include “in
early remission” and “in sustained remission.” Finally, a severity specifier has also
been added to differentiate mild, moderate, and severe gambling disorder on the ba-
sis of the number of criteria the individual fulfills.

KEY POINTS

- The name of the diagnostic class has been changed from “substance-related
    disorders” to “substance-related and addictive disorders” to reflect emerging con-
    cepts regarding the addictions. Ten types of substance use disorders are listed,
    as well as gambling disorder, which is classified as a non-substance-related
    disorder.
- The major change is that the categories of abuse and dependence have been
    merged, creating a single category for a “use” disorder.
- DSM-IV’s hallucinogen-related disorders and phencyclidine (or phencyclidine-
    like)–related disorders have been merged into a single category.
- The stimulant-related disorders category has replaced the categories for am-
    phetamine and cocaine use disorders. Cannabis use disorder, cannabis with-
    drawal, and caffeine withdrawal are new. Nicotine-related disorders are now
    called tobacco-related disorders.
- Gambling disorder (formerly DSM-IV pathological gambling) has been moved
    to this chapter, reflecting emerging concepts regarding the addictions.

## The DSM-5 chapter on neurocognitive disorders encompasses disor-

ders that have cognitive impairment as their presenting problem. In DSM-IV, the
chapter was called “Delirium, Dementia, and Amnestic and Other Cognitive Disor-
ders.” The new title refers to disorders that are acquired (i.e., those attributed to med-
ical conditions or the effects of drugs of abuse or medications) or are degenerative


**360** DSM-5 Guidebook

(i.e., those that reflect a decline from a previously attained level of cognitive function-
ing) rather than disorders that are congenital or apparent in childhood. The title was
selected in part to avoid the stigma associated with the word _dementia_ when catego-
rizing deficits among younger people with progressive cognitive decline, such as that
associated with HIV infection or traumatic brain injury. The neurocognitive disorders
are divided into three broad syndromes: delirium, major neurocognitive disorders,
and mild neurocognitive disorders. Disorders in this chapter are attributable to changes
in brain structure, function, or chemistry.
Cognitive disorders have been recognized for centuries and have been an important
category in DSM. In DSM-I, “acute” and “chronic” brain disorders constituted the two
major divisions, each subcategorized by presumed cause (e.g., cerebral arteriosclerosis,
convulsive disorder). In DSM-II, these disorders were listed as either “psychoses asso-
ciated with organic brain syndromes” or “nonpsychotic organic brain syndromes.” The
term _psychosis_ was used to denote severity (i.e., that the condition resulted in suffi-
ciently impaired mental functioning to interfere grossly with the capacity to meet the
ordinary demands of life) rather than the presence of hallucinations or delusions. What
current practitioners might refer to as vascular dementia would have been classified
in DSM-II as psychoses associated with organic brain syndromes with cerebral arterio-
sclerosis or other cerebrovascular disturbance. The term _organic mental disorders_ contin-
ued to be used in DSM-III, although the term _psychosis_ was no longer used to character-
ize severity. The word _organic_ was finally omitted in DSM-IV; it was considered to be
outdated because it implied that other disorders in the manual did not have an or-
ganic component.
The major change to this diagnostic class with DSM-5 is the introduction of the con-
cept of “major” and “mild” neurocognitive disorders. The latter are less severe forms of
cognitive impairment and can be a focus of care. The DSM-5 neurocognitive disorders
are listed in Table 17–1.

DELIRIUM

Delirium

Delirium is a disturbance in level of awareness or attention, marked by the acute or
subacute onset of cognitive changes attributable to a general medical condition; it
tends to have an acute onset, relatively brief duration, and fluctuating course. Delir-
ium is distinguished from major or mild neurocognitive disorders on the basis of its
core characteristics: a disturbance in level of awareness and the reduced ability to di-
rect, focus, sustain, and shift attention. Although some level of disturbance of aware-
ness and attention can be observed in all neurocognitive disorders, these disturbances
are not prominent in major or mild neurocognitive disorder (the relative absence of
this disturbance was previously referred to as “clear consciousness”). Delirium can
(and frequently does) coexist with major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
Diagnosing delirium is important because its underlying cause is often correctable,
whereas untreated delirium is associated with a high mortality rate, serious medical
complications, and irreversible cognitive impairments.

attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to the environment).
B. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to a few day
represents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and tends to fluct
ate in severity during the course of a day.
C. An additional disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation, la
guage, visuospatial ability, or perception).
D. The disturbances in Criteria A and C are not better explained by another preexi
ing, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder and do not occur in the co
text of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma.

tion, substance intoxication or withdrawal (i.e., due to a drug of abuse or to a med-
ication), or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multiple etiologies.

Specify whether:
**Substance intoxication delirium:** This diagnosis should be made instead of sub-
stance intoxication when the symptoms in Criteria A and C predominate in the clin-
ical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific sub-
stance] intoxication delirium are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-
10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use dis-
order present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder
is comorbid with the substance intoxication delirium, the 4th position character
is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the
substance intoxication delirium (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine
intoxication delirium”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is co-
morbid with the substance intoxication delirium, the 4th position character is “2,”
and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe
[substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance
use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-
time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the
clinician should record only the substance intoxication delirium.

**Mixed level of activity:** The individual has a normal level of psychomotor activity
even though attention and awareness are disturbed. Also includes individuals
whose activity level rapidly fluctuates.


**364** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion A

Delirium is a disturbance in level of awareness or attention, marked by the acute or
subacute onset of cognitive changes. The individual’s inability to appreciate or re-
spond appropriately to the environment may be evidenced by problems with focus
or sustained attention, apparent disorientation in familiar settings, and perseverating
in responses. DSM-IV referred to these symptoms as a “disturbance of consciousness.”
_Consciousness,_ however, was considered an imprecise term to describe the symptoms
of delirium.

Criterion B

The course of delirium is usually short, developing over a few hours or a few days.
The delirium usually remits when the underlying cause is identified and successfully
treated.

Criterion C

Memory problems, disorientation, and language difficulties are usually present. Vi-
suospatial impairment and impairment in executive function are also symptoms of
delirium.

Criterion D

DSM-5 has also added a clarification that a preexisting neurocognitive disorder does
not account for the cognitive changes. A severely reduced level of arousal, such as
coma, would not provide a context adequate to assess orientation, attention, and cog-
nitive functioning.

Criterion E

This criterion requires that the disturbance in attention and awareness be a direct
physiological consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or
withdrawal, or exposure to a toxin, or be due to multiple etiologies.

Subtypes and Specifiers

There are multiple subtypes for the diagnosis of delirium that address etiological is-
sues. Two subtypes indicate whether the delirium is due to substance intoxication or
substance withdrawal. These diagnoses should be made instead of substance intoxi-
cation or substance withdrawal when the symptoms in Criteria A and C predominate
in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Sub-
stance intoxication or withdrawal delirium requires, in addition to the standard criteria
for delirium, that the delirium have started during or after intoxication or withdrawal
and that the substance be capable of producing delirium.
The following classes of substances can result in a substance intoxication delirium:
cannabis; phencyclidine and other hallucinogens; stimulants; inhalants; opioids; and
sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics. During withdrawal, alcohol, opioids, and sed-


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **365**

atives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics can be causes of delirium. Other (or unknown) sub-
stances can also be specified.
Another possible subtype is medication-induced delirium. Even in the absence of
intoxication or withdrawal, a number of medications and toxins (e.g., benztropine,
dexamethasone) can lead to delirium.
Other subtypes indicate whether the delirium is due to another medical condition
(e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) or multiple etiologies (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy plus
alcohol withdrawal).
Finally, there are specifiers to indicate whether the delirium is acute (lasting a few
hours to a few days) or persistent (lasting weeks or months) and whether the delirium
gives rise to hyperactive psychomotor activity (often accompanied by mood lability,
agitation, and/or refusal to cooperate with medical care), hypoactive psychomotor
activity (often accompanied by sluggishness and lethargy that approaches stupor), or
a mixed level of activity (normal level of psychomotor activity even though attention
and awareness are disturbed; includes individuals whose activity level rapidly fluctu-
ates). Individuals with delirium may rapidly switch between hyperactive and hypoac-
tive states. The hyperactive state may be more common or more frequently recog-
nized and often is associated with medication side effects and drug withdrawal. The
hypoactive state may be more frequent in older adults.

Other Specified Delirium and

Unspecified Delirium

Other specified delirium or unspecified delirium is coded when it is not possible to
establish an etiological subtype or when the disorder is subsyndromal (i.e., does not
meet full criteria for delirium, such as in attenuated delirium syndrome). Examples
include a clinical presentation of delirium that is suspected to be due to a general
medical condition or substance use but for which there is insufficient evidence to es-
tablish a specific etiology. Such a diagnosis may also be appropriate when the delir-
ium is due to causes not listed in this section (e.g., sensory deprivation).

Other Specified Delirium **780.09 (R41.0)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of delirium
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium
or any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified delirium category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for delir-
ium or any specific neurocognitive disorder. This is done by recording “other specified
delirium” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “attenuated delirium syndrome”).
An example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” des-
ignation is the following:


**366** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
Attenuated delirium syndrome: This syndrome applies in cases of delirium in
which the severity of cognitive impairment falls short of that required for the diag-
nosis, or in which some, but not all, diagnostic criteria for delirium are met.
```
Unspecified Delirium **780.09 (R41.0)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of delirium
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium
or any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The unspec-
ified delirium category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to spec-
ify the reason that the criteria are not met for delirium, and includes presentations for
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emer-
gency room settings).

MAJOR AND MILD NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS

Major Neurocognitive Disorder

Major neurocognitive disorder (including what was formerly known in DSM-IV as
dementia) is an acquired disorder with significant cognitive decline in one or more
(typically at least two) of the following domains:

- _Complex attention_ (sustained attention, divided attention, selective attention, pro-
    cessing speed)
- _Executive function_ (planning, decision making, working memory, responding to
    feedback/error correction, overriding habits, mental flexibility)
- _Learning and memory_ (immediate memory, recent memory [including free recall,
    cued recall, and recognition memory])
- _Language_ (expressive language [including naming, fluency, and grammar and syn-
    tax] and receptive language)
- _Perceptual-motor ability_ (construction and visual perception)
- _Social cognition_ (recognition of emotions, theory of mind, behavioral regulation)

The cognitive deficits must be sufficient to interfere with functional indepen-
dence. Unlike the DSM-IV criteria for dementia, the DSM-5 major neurocognitive dis-
order criteria do not require memory to be one of the impaired domains and allow the
cognitive deficit to be limited to one domain.
Although the word _dementia_ is not precluded from use in the etiological subtypes, it
is subsumed by the newly named entity _major neurocognitive disorder._ The term _dementia_
was considered pejorative and stigmatizing by some, particularly among younger
adults with cognitive deficits related to HIV infection, head injury, or other causes.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major Neurocognitive Disorder

A. Evidence of significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in
one or more cognitive domains (complex attention, executive function, learning
and memory, language, perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on:

1. Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician that there
    has been a significant decline in cognitive function; and
2. A substantial impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by
standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another quantified
clinical assessment.

B. The cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday activities (i.e., at a
minimum, requiring assistance with complex instrumental activities of daily living
such as paying bills or managing medications).
C. The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of a delirium.
D. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., ma-
jor depressive disorder, schizophrenia).

Specify:
**Without behavioral disturbance:** If the cognitive disturbance is not accompanied
by any clinically significant behavioral disturbance.
**With behavioral disturbance** (specify disturbance): If the cognitive disturbance
is accompanied by a clinically significant behavioral disturbance (e.g., psychotic
symptoms, mood disturbance, agitation, apathy, or other behavioral symptoms).

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., housework, man-
aging money).
**Moderate:** Difficulties with basic activities of daily living (e.g., feeding, dressing).
**Severe:** Fully dependent.

Criterion A

The DSM-5 wording focuses on “decline” from a previous level of performance, rather
than “deficit” as in DSM-IV. The DSM-IV criteria for dementia used Alzheimer ’s disease
as the prototype and thus required memory impairment for all dementias. There is
growing recognition that in many of the neurocognitive disorders (e.g., those related
to HIV infection, cerebrovascular disease, frontotemporal degeneration, traumatic
brain injury), other domains such as language or executive functions may be impaired
first, or exclusively, depending on the part of the brain affected and the natural his-
tory of the disease. The new definition also focuses first on performance rather than
disability. The criterion encourages the use of objective measures, including formal
neuropsychological testing where feasible, with less exclusive reliance on individual
judgment. Observation of decline and objective assessment are both included to en-
sure specificity. Although this evidence is more critical for diagnosing mild neurocog-
nitive disorder, similar statements are included for major neurocognitive disorder for
parallel structure of Criterion A.

Criterion B

The DSM-5 language preserves the traditional function-based threshold for dementia
but tries to operationalize it more clearly as a loss of independence.

Criteria C and D

The cognitive decline seen in major neurocognitive disorder affects some of the same
cognitive domains as seen in delirium. Although it is clinically important to distin-
guish major neurocognitive disorder from delirium, the two may co-occur.
The cognitive deficits in major neurocognitive disorder are not better explained by
another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia).

Subtypes and Specifiers

Subtypes and specifiers for major neurocognitive disorder are discussed under “Mild
Neurocognitive Disorder” below.


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **371**

Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

The mild neurocognitive disorder diagnosis is new and recognizes the substantial clin-
ical needs of individuals who have mild cognitive deficits in one or more of the same
domains as in major neurocognitive disorder but who can function independently
(i.e., have intact instrumental activities of daily living) (Petersen and O’Brien 2006).
Known in many settings as _mild cognitive impairment,_ the disorder can be a focus of
early intervention. This may enable the use of treatments that are ineffective at more
severe levels of impairment and/or neuronal damage. In DSM-IV, mild cognitive dis-
order was subsumed under the category cognitive disorder not otherwise specified.
Examples of mild neurocognitive disorder are the prevalent neurocognitive disorders
associated with such conditions as traumatic brain injury, HIV infection, substance use–
related brain disorders, and early or mild stages of cerebrovascular disease or neurode-
generative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Because these conditions are increas-
ingly being seen in clinical practice, clinicians have a need for reliable diagnostic criteria
to assess their patients and provide services—tasks that include treatment of associated
mood symptoms, further investigation of brain function, identification of treatable
causes, and, for progressive disorders, selection of appropriate early interventions.

Diagnostic Criteria for Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

A. Evidence of modest cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one
or more cognitive domains (complex attention, executive function, learning and
memory, language, perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on:

1. Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician that there
    has been a mild decline in cognitive function; and
2. A modest impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by
    standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another quantified
    clinical assessment.
B. The cognitive deficits do not interfere with capacity for independence in everyday
activities (i.e., complex instrumental activities of daily living such as paying bills or
managing medications are preserved, but greater effort, compensatory strategies,
or accommodation may be required).
C. The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of a delirium.
D. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.,
major depressive disorder, schizophrenia).

**Coding note:** For mild neurocognitive disorder due to any of the medical etiologies

ological medical conditions. For substance/medication-induced mild neurocognitive
disorder, code based on type of substance; see “Substance/Medication-Induced Ma-
jor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder.” For unspecified mild neurocognitive disorder,
code **799.59 (R41.9).**

Specify:
**Without behavioral disturbance:** If the cognitive disturbance is not accompanied
by any clinically significant behavioral disturbance.
**With behavioral disturbance** (specify disturbance): If the cognitive disturbance
is accompanied by a clinically significant behavioral disturbance (e.g., psychotic
symptoms, mood disturbance, agitation, apathy, or other behavioral symptoms).

Criterion A

The combination of symptoms and objective assessment is critical in mild neurocog-
nitive disorder to maintain specificity. A report of a change in an individual’s abilities
protects against overdiagnosing the disorder in those with lifelong poor performance,
whereas objective assessment protects against overdiagnosing the disorder among
the “worried well.”

Criterion B

Mild neurocognitive disorder is the diagnosis for people who are still independent but
who must exert greater effort to carry out tasks or must use compensatory strategies.

Criteria C and D

The cognitive decline seen in mild neurocognitive disorder affects some of the same
cognitive domains as seen in delirium. Although it is clinically important to distinguish
mild neurocognitive disorder from delirium, the two may co-occur.
The cognitive deficits in mild neurocognitive disorder are not better explained by
another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia).

Subtypes and Specifiers for Both Major and

Mild Neurocognitive Disorders

Both major and mild neurocognitive disorders list subtypes by which the clinician can
code the proposed etiology of the disorder. All of the following subtypes require that the
diagnostic criteria for either mild or major neurocognitive disorder be met. The individ-
ual disorders are then differentiated on the basis of their etiology. In addition to the etio-


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **373**

logical subtypes (detailed below), major and mild neurocognitive disorders may be
further delineated by the specifier “with behavioral disturbance” or “without behavioral
disturbance” (e.g., psychotic symptoms, mood disturbance, agitation, apathy, or other be-
havioral symptoms). For major neurocognitive disorder, there are additional severity
specifiers to document the functional effects of the neurocognitive disorder: “mild,” re-
flecting difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., housework, managing
money); “moderate,” reflecting difficulties with basic activities of daily living (e.g., feed-
ing, dressing); and “severe,” meaning the individual is fully dependent.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that typically occurs in late life but
can occur earlier. It is marked by insidious onset, gradual decline, and typically an early
prominent memory loss. Alzheimer’s disease is also the most common cause of neuro-
cognitive disorder. Because of the modest predictive value of the clinical picture alone
and the significant social consequences of an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, the mild variant of
Alzheimer’s disease subtype is not commonly diagnosed. Individuals seen in memory
disorder clinics whose presentations meet criteria for mild neurocognitive disorder prog-
ress to dementia of the Alzheimer type at the rate of 12%–15% per year, while population-
based studies show a much lower rate of progression. Research is ongoing into what spe-
cific features of mild neurocognitive disorder might reliably indicate the presence of pro-
dromal Alzheimer ’s disease. The diagnosis of the Alzheimer’s specifier must be made on
clinical grounds in the absence of brain biopsy. Alzheimer’s disease has a characteristic
pattern of onset and progression of cognitive impairments.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive
Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment in one or more cogni-
tive domains (for major neurocognitive disorder, at least two domains must be im-
paired).
C. Criteria are met for either probable or possible Alzheimer’s disease as follows:

```
For major neurocognitive disorder:
Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if either of the following is present;
otherwise, possible Alzheimer’s disease should be diagnosed.
```
1. Evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from family his-
    tory or genetic testing.
2. All three of the following are present:
    a. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning and at least one other cog-
       nitive domain (based on detailed history or serial neuropsychological testing).


**374** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
b. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended pla-
teaus.
c. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative or
cerebrovascular disease, or another neurological, mental, or systemic dis-
ease or condition likely contributing to cognitive decline).
For mild neurocognitive disorder:
Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if there is evidence of a causative
Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from either genetic testing or family history.
Possible Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a causative
Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from either genetic testing or family history,
and all three of the following are present:
```
1. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning.
2. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended plateaus.
3. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative or
    cerebrovascular disease, or another neurological or systemic disease or con-
    dition likely contributing to cognitive decline).

D. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neu-
rodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurologi-
cal, or systemic disorder.

**Coding note:** For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease,
with behavioral disturbance, code first **331.0 (G30.9)** Alzheimer’s disease, followed by
**294.11 (F02.81)** major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease. For proba-
ble neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, without behavioral disturbance,
code first **331.0 (G30.9)** Alzheimer’s disease, followed by **294.10 (F02.80)** major neuro-
cognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, without behavioral disturbance.

For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, code **331.9
(G31.9)** possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease. ( **Note:** Do
not use the additional code for Alzheimer’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be
coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, code **331.83 (G31.84).**
( **Note:** Do not use the additional code for Alzheimer’s disease. Behavioral disturbance
cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Major or Mild Frontotemporal

Neurocognitive Disorder

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration has been found to be an important cause of neu-
rocognitive disorders. Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is characterized by
behavioral and personality changes and language impairment. In fact, DSM-5 recog-
nizes both a behavioral (e.g., apathy, stereotyped behaviors) and a language (e.g.,
word finding) variant. Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder can be difficult to dis-
tinguish from primary psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder),
and including them in the differential diagnosis will be helpful. Neuroimaging (e.g.,


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **375**

atrophy in frontotemporal regions) and genetics (e.g., mutations in the gene coding
for microtubule-associated protein tau) will be particularly useful in documenting
anomalies in frontal and temporal regions.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal
Neurocognitive Disorder

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression.
C. Either (1) or (2):

1. Behavioral variant:
    a. Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms:
       i. Behavioral disinhibition.
ii. Apathy or inertia.
iii. Loss of sympathy or empathy.
iv. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior.
v. Hyperorality and dietary changes.
    b. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities.
2. Language variant:
    a. Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production,
       word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension.

D. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function.
E. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neu-
rodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurologi-
cal, or systemic disorder.

**Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if either of the fol-
lowing is present; otherwise, **possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder**
should be diagnosed:

1. Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation,
    from either family history or genetic testing.
2. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuro-
    imaging.

**Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if there is no evi-
dence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed.

**Coding note:** For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar
degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first **331.19 (G31.09)** frontotemporal
disease, followed by **294.11 (F02.81)** probable major neurocognitive disorder due to
frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major
neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral
disturbance, code first **331.19 (G31.09)** frontotemporal disease, followed by **294.10
(F02.80)** probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degen-
eration, without behavioral disturbance.

degeneration. ( **Note:** Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behav-
ioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

**331.83 (G31.84).** ( **Note:** Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease.
Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Major or Mild Neurocognitive

Disorder With Lewy Bodies

Lewy body disease is now recognized as the second most common degenerative de-
mentia of older adults. The First International Consortium on Dementia With Lewy
Bodies published consensus clinical and pathological criteria (McKeith et al. 1996).
The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are based on the third and most recent criteria (McKeith
2006). Prominent visual hallucinations and parkinsonian features tend to occur early
in the illness. The course is often slightly more rapid than that in Alzheimer’s disease.
Individuals with this form of neurocognitive disorder are very sensitive to the extra-
pyramidal side effects of conventional antipsychotics.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive
Disorder With Lewy Bodies

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. The disorder has an insidious onset and gradual progression.
C. The disorder meets a combination of core diagnostic features and suggestive di-
agnostic features for either probable or possible neurocognitive disorder with Lewy
bodies.
**For probable major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies,** the in-
dividual has two core features, or one suggestive feature with one or more core
features. For **possible major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bod-
ies,** the individual has only one core feature, or one or more suggestive features.

1. Core diagnostic features:
    a. Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness.
    b. Recurrent visual hallucinations that are well formed and detailed.
    c. Spontaneous features of parkinsonism, with onset subsequent to the devel-
       opment of cognitive decline.
2. Suggestive diagnostic features:
    a. Meets criteria for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.
    b. Severe neuroleptic sensitivity.

D. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neu-
rodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurologi-
cal, or systemic disorder.


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **377**

**Coding note:** For probable major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, with be-

Major or Mild Vascular

Neurocognitive Disorder

The concept of vascular dementia has changed since the publication of DSM-IV. The
former concept of multi-infarct dementia (i.e., DSM-IV vascular dementia) has been
replaced by a much broader concept of dementia attributed to both small and large
vessel disease. Assessment of cerebrovascular disease relies on history, physical ex-
amination, and neuroimaging. The new criteria are consistent with those of the other
neurocognitive disorders as well as with the prevailing view among experts in this
field that cognitive disorders caused by vascular disease lie on a continuum.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive
Disorder

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. The clinical features are consistent with a vascular etiology, as suggested by ei-
ther of the following:

1. Onset of the cognitive deficits is temporally related to one or more cerebrovas-
    cular events.
2. Evidence for decline is prominent in complex attention (including processing
    speed) and frontal-executive function.

C. There is evidence of the presence of cerebrovascular disease from history, phys-
ical examination, and/or neuroimaging considered sufficient to account for the
neurocognitive deficits.
D. The symptoms are not better explained by another brain disease or systemic dis-
order.

**Probable vascular neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if one of the following is pres-
ent; otherwise **possible vascular neurocognitive disorder** should be diagnosed:


**378** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. Clinical criteria are supported by neuroimaging evidence of significant parenchy-
    mal injury attributed to cerebrovascular disease (neuroimaging-supported).
2. The neurocognitive syndrome is temporally related to one or more documented
    cerebrovascular events.
3. Both clinical and genetic (e.g., cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with sub-
    cortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) evidence of cerebrovascular disease is
    present.

**Possible vascular neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if the clinical criteria are
met but neuroimaging is not available and the temporal relationship of the neurocog-
nitive syndrome with one or more cerebrovascular events is not established.

**Coding note:** For probable major vascular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral
disturbance, code **290.40 (F01.51).** For probable major vascular neurocognitive disor-
der, without behavioral disturbance, code **290.40 (F01.50).** For possible major vascular
neurocognitive disorder, with or without behavioral disturbance, code **331.9 (G31.9).** An
additional medical code for the cerebrovascular disease is not needed.

For mild vascular neurocognitive disorder, code **331.83 (G31.84).** ( **Note:** Do not use
an additional code for the vascular disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but
should still be indicated in writing.)

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to

Traumatic Brain Injury

Neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury is caused by an impact to the
head or with rapid movement or brain displacement within the skull. The clinical
characteristics of the disorder depend on the location, severity, and duration of the
trauma. This diagnosis may be difficult in individuals with alcohol use disorders be-
cause such individuals are at increased risk both for repeated head injuries and for
substance-induced neurocognitive disorder. Posttraumatic stress may co-occur with the
disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive
Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is evidence of a traumatic brain injury—that is, an impact to the head or
other mechanisms of rapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull,
with one or more of the following:

1. Loss of consciousness.
2. Posttraumatic amnesia.
3. Disorientation and confusion.
4. Neurological signs (e.g., neuroimaging demonstrating injury; a new onset of
    seizures; a marked worsening of a preexisting seizure disorder; visual field
    cuts; anosmia; hemiparesis).


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **379**

C. The neurocognitive disorder presents immediately after the occurrence of the trau-
matic brain injury or immediately after recovery of consciousness and persists past
the acute post-injury period.

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with
behavioral disturbance: For ICD-9-CM, first code **907.0** late effect of intracranial injury
without skull fracture, followed by **294.11** major neurocognitive disorder due to trau-
matic brain injury, with behavioral disturbance. For ICD-10-CM, first code **S06.2X9S**
diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, se-
quela; followed by **F02.81** major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury,
with behavioral disturbance.

For major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, without behavioral dis-

Substance/Medication-Induced Major or

Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Substance/medication-induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder needs to be
distinguished from the cognitive impairments commonly seen with substance intox-
ication or withdrawal. The impairments seen in intoxication or withdrawal are usu-
ally reversible, whereas substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder is a
persisting condition. This disorder results from the neurotoxic effects of a substance
or medication, and the deficits are usually permanent. This disorder is more common
in older individuals, with longer use of drugs or alcohol, and with other risk factors
such as nutritional deficits.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced Major or
Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. The neurocognitive impairments do not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium and persist beyond the usual duration of intoxication and acute with-
drawal.
C. The involved substance or medication and duration and extent of use are capable
of producing the neurocognitive impairment.


**380** DSM-5 Guidebook

D. The temporal course of the neurocognitive deficits is consistent with the timing of
substance or medication use and abstinence (e.g., the deficits remain stable or im-
prove after a period of abstinence).
E. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition or is
not better explained by another mental disorder.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medi-
cation]-induced neurocognitive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with
the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the
clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced
neurocognitive disorder (e.g., “mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major
neurocognitive disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and
the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance]
use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there
is no comorbid substance use disorder, then the 4th position character is “9,” and the
clinician should record only the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder. For some
classes of substances (i.e., alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics), it is not permissi-
ble to code a comorbid mild substance use disorder with a substance-induced neuro-
cognitive disorder; only a comorbid moderate or severe substance use disorder, or no
substance use disorder, can be diagnosed. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but
should still be indicated in writing.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to HIV Infection

Individuals with HIV infection are at increased risk of developing a neurocognitive
disorder. The disorder could be due to any number of associated diseases, such as
toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, cryptococcosis, central nervous system lymphoma,
or tuberculosis. This diagnosis should be given only when cognitive impairment is
judged to be due to the direct central nervous system effects of HIV. This disorder is
more common in individuals with prior episodes of severe immunosuppression,
those with high viral loads in the cerebrospinal fluid, and those with HIV-related ane-
mia or hypoalbuminemia.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Prion Disease

Neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease is rare, and the most common type is
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The disease is accompanied by ataxia, myoclonus, chorea,
and dystonia. The course is typically rapidly progressive over as little as 6 months.
The diagnosis is confirmed with brain biopsy or autopsy.

Disorder Due to Prion Disease

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is insidious onset, and rapid progression of impairment is common.
C. There are motor features of prion disease, such as myoclonus or ataxia, or bio-

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Parkinson’s Disease

The essential feature of this disorder is cognitive decline after the onset of Parkinson’s
disease. As many as 75% of individuals with Parkinson’s disease will develop a major
neurocognitive disorder, and 27% will have a mild neurocognitive disorder. Individ-
uals who are older at disease onset and those with increasing duration of disease ap-
pear more likely to develop a neurocognitive disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive
Disorder Due to Parkinson’s Disease

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. The disturbance occurs in the setting of established Parkinson’s disease.
C. There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment.
D. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition and is
not better explained by another mental disorder.

**Major or mild neurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson’s disease**
should be diagnosed if 1 and 2 are both met. **Major or mild neurocognitive disorder
possibly due to Parkinson’s disease** should be diagnosed if 1 or 2 is met:

1. There is no evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative
    or cerebrovascular disease or another neurological, mental, or systemic disease
    or condition likely contributing to cognitive decline).
2. The Parkinson’s disease clearly precedes the onset of the neurocognitive disorder.

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson’s disease,
with behavioral disturbance, code first **332.0 (G20)** Parkinson’s disease, followed by

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Huntington’s Disease

Cognitive and behavioral changes often precede the motor abnormalities of bradyki-
nesia and chorea. Diagnosis of Huntington’s disease is based on the extrapyramidal
motor abnormalities in a person with a family history of Huntington’s, or genetic test-
ing (CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene on chromosome 4).

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder
Due to Huntington’s Disease

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is insidious onset and gradual progression.
C. There is clinically established Huntington’s disease, or risk for Huntington’s dis-
ease based on family history or genetic testing.
D. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition and is
not better explained by another mental disorder.

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, with behav-
ioral disturbance, code first **333.4 (G10)** Huntington’s disease, followed by **294.11 (F02.81)**
major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, with behavioral disturbance.
For major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, without behavioral distur-
bance, code first **333.4 (G10)** Huntington’s disease, followed by **294.10 (F02.80)** major
neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, without behavioral disturbance.

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, code **331.83 (G31.84).**
( **Note:** Do not use the additional code for Huntington’s disease. Behavioral disturbance
cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

The diagnosis neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition is used when
an individual has a cause other than those listed specifically in DSM-5. Potential causes
include brain tumors, subdural hematomas, multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis, hypo-
glycemia, renal or hepatic failure, childhood and adult storage diseases, and vitamin
deficiencies.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder
Due to Another Medical Condition

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **385**

that the neurocognitive disorder is the pathophysiological consequence of another
medical condition.
C. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder or an-
other specific neurocognitive disorder (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, HIV infection).

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition,
with behavioral disturbance, code first the other medical condition, followed by the major
neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, with behavioral disturbance
(e.g., 340 [G35] multiple sclerosis, **294.11 [F02.81]** major neurocognitive disorder due
to multiple sclerosis, with behavioral disturbance). For major neurocognitive disorder
due to another medical condition, without behavioral disturbance, code first the other
medical condition, followed by the major neurocognitive disorder due to another med-
ical condition, without behavioral disturbance (e.g., 340 [G35] multiple sclerosis,
**294.10 [F02.80]** major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple sclerosis, without be-
havioral disturbance).

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, code **331.83
(G31.84).** ( **Note:** Do not use the additional code for the other medical condition. Be-
havioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Multiple Etiologies

If a major or mild neurocognitive disorder is of mixed etiology (e.g., Alzheimer’s dis-
ease and cerebrovascular disease) and the multiple underlying diseases are known, the
multiple etiological subtypes should all be diagnosed.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder
Due to Multiple Etiologies

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
the neurocognitive disorder is the pathophysiological consequence of more than
one etiological process, excluding substances (e.g., neurocognitive disorder due
to Alzheimer’s disease with subsequent development of vascular neurocognitive
disorder).
**Note:** Please refer to the diagnostic criteria for the various neurocognitive disor-
ders due to specific medical conditions for guidance on establishing the particular
etiologies.
C. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder and do
not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with be-
havioral disturbance, code **294.11 (F02.81)** ; for major neurocognitive disorder due to
multiple etiologies, without behavioral disturbance, code **294.10 (F02.80).** All of the eti-
ological medical conditions (with the exception of vascular disease) should be coded


**386** DSM-5 Guidebook

and listed separately immediately before major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple
etiologies (e.g., **331.0 [G30.9]** Alzheimer’s disease; **331.82 [G31.83]** Lewy body dis-
ease; **294.11 [F02.81]** major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with be-
havioral disturbance).

When a cerebrovascular etiology is contributing to the neurocognitive disorder, the di-
agnosis of vascular neurocognitive disorder should be listed in addition to major neuro-
cognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies. For example, for a presentation of major
neurocognitive disorder due to both Alzheimer’s disease and vascular disease, with
behavioral disturbance, code the following: **331.0 (G30.9)** Alzheimer’s disease; **294.11
(F02.81)** major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with behavioral dis-
turbance; **290.40 (F01.51)** major vascular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral dis-
turbance.

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, code **331.83 (G31.84).**
( **Note:** Do not use the additional codes for the etiologies. Behavioral disturbance can-
not be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder

Neurocognitive disorders may be diagnosed as unspecified when there are symptoms
of a neurocognitive disorder that cause distress or impairment but do not meet full cri-
teria for any disorder in this diagnostic class. This diagnosis is used when the precise
etiology cannot be determined.

Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder 799.59 ( **R41.9** )

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurocog-
nitive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The un-
specified neurocognitive disorder category is used in situations in which the precise eti-
ology cannot be determined with sufficient certainty to make an etiological attribution.

**Coding note:** For unspecified major or mild neurocognitive disorder, code 799.59
(R41.9). ( **Note:** Do not use additional codes for any presumed etiological medical con-
ditions. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but may be indicated in writing.)

KEY POINTS

- Called “delirium, dementia, and amnestic and other cognitive disorders” in
    DSM-IV, the diagnostic class has been renamed “neurocognitive disorders.”
- DSM-5 recognizes both major neurocognitive disorders and a less severe level
    of cognitive impairment, referred to as mild neurocognitive disorder. The latter
    term is used for less disabling syndromes that may be a focus of concern.
- Examples of symptoms and assessments of the various neurocognitive do-
    mains (e.g., complex attention, executive function) are provided at both major
    and mild levels of impairment.
- Clinicians who diagnose either a major or mild neurocognitive disorder can spec-
    ify an etiologic subtype (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease).

## Maladaptive character traits have been recognized for millennia.

Formal attempts to list the variety of personality types took root with DSM-I, in which
eight different types of personality disorders were enumerated. The list was expanded
to 10 in DSM-II. In these early manuals, the disorders were briefly described but there
were no criteria—for example, inadequate personality in DSM-II: “The behavior pat-
tern is characterized by ineffectual responses to emotional, social, intellectual and
physical demands. While the patient seems neither physically nor mentally deficient,


**390** DSM-5 Guidebook

he does manifest inadaptability, ineptness, poor judgment, social instability, and lack
of physical and emotional stamina” (American Psychiatric Association 1968, p. 44).
In DSM-III, personality disorders were accorded new prominence by being coded
on a separate axis (Axis II) in the new multiaxial system. Criteria for 11 different per-
sonality disorders were included, some retained from DSM-II and others newly cre-
ated in response to clinical and research observations (e.g., schizotypal personality
disorder, borderline personality disorder). DSM-III also introduced the concept of per-
sonality disorder “clusters,” in which disorder types were grouped by their predomi-
nant symptom pattern: Cluster A for individuals considered odd or eccentric; Cluster B
for individuals considered dramatic, emotional, or erratic; and Cluster C for individ-
uals considered anxious or dependent.
In DSM-III-R and DSM-IV, the personality disorder diagnostic criteria were edited
for clarity and in some cases simplified. The number of disorders was pared down to
10 in DSM-IV with the elimination of passive-aggressive personality disorder, which
was thought to be insufficiently distinct.
During the development of DSM-5, the Personality and Personality Disorders Work
Group developed a model that combined categorical diagnosis with optional dimen-
sional ratings. Work group members had responded to the call by the DSM-5 Task Force
to introduce dimensional measures that could be used to assess symptoms and syn-
dromes and provide a more complete evaluation of an individual’s disorder and level
of functioning (Widiger et al. 2006) (See Chapter 1, “The March to DSM-5”).
The work group recommended reducing the number of personality disorders to six
by eliminating the dependent, histrionic, paranoid, and schizoid types; reformulating
the diagnostic criteria for the remaining disorders to emphasize personality function-
ing and maladaptive personality traits; and describing five broad personality domains
and 25 specific trait facets that could be dimensionally rated. The proposal received
much criticism, in part because of its complexity and the perception that it would be
overly time consuming for clinicians (Gunderson 2010). In December 2012, the Ameri-
can Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees voted to move the new scheme to Section
III in DSM-5 and to include the 10 specific DSM-IV personality disorders in Section II.
Thus, both versions are available to serve clinical practice and research initiatives (see
Chapter 21, “Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders”).
There are several changes to highlight in the class. Perhaps the most important
change is that the multiaxial evaluation system has been discontinued, and for that
reason personality disorders are no longer coded on Axis II. The decision to discontinue
the multiaxial system was largely due to its incompatibility with diagnostic systems
in the rest of medicine, but there were other motivations as well. The scheme had been
developed for DSM-III to help ensure that personality disorders and intellectual dis-
ability would receive greater recognition. An unintended consequence of placing per-
sonality disorders on an axis separate from the major disorders was to further
marginalize them. Personality disorders are now coded at the same level as other
mental disorders.
Next, the diagnosis personality disorder not otherwise specified has been re-
placed by other specified personality disorder and unspecified personality disorder.
These two diagnostic categories are used in situations in which the individual’s per-


**_Personality Disorders_** **391**

sonality pattern meets general criteria for a personality disorder and traits of several
different personality disorders are present but the criteria for any specific disorder are
not met (e.g., the individual is considered to have a personality disorder that is not
included in DSM-5, such as inadequate personality disorder). The unspecified per-
sonality disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific personality disorder and
when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.
Personality change due to another medical condition has been moved to this chapter
from DSM-IV’s “Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition.” The purpose
of this change was to place the diagnosis within the class relevant to the predominant
symptom pattern.
Additional changes to the class were prompted by discussions about the etiologi-
cal relationship among disorders. Schizotypal personality disorder has been listed
with the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, and antisocial per-
sonality disorder with the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders. The
text and criteria for these two disorders remain in the personality disorders chapter.

GENERAL PERSONALITY DISORDER

DSM-IV introduced a general set of criteria for personality disorders that has not
changed in DSM-5 except for minor edits. They address the question of whether or
not an individual has a personality disorder. If present, the clinician should determine
which of the ten specific disorders is present (the person’s presentation may meet the
criteria for more than one disorder). If the person’s presentation meets the general di-
agnostic criteria but the criteria for any of the specific disorders are not met, then the
diagnosis of either other specified personality disorder or unspecified personality dis-
order should be used.
The personality disorders continue to be grouped into three clusters on the basis
of their descriptive similarity: Cluster A includes paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal
personality disorders. People with these disorders may appear odd or eccentric. Clus-
ter B includes antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders.
Individuals with these disorders may appear dramatic, emotional, or erratic. Cluster C
includes avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Indi-
viduals with these disorders may appear anxious or fearful. The ten personality disor-
ders are described later in this chapter.

Diagnostic Criteria for General Personality Disorder

A. An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from
the expectations of the individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or
more) of the following areas:

1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events).
2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional
response).


**392** DSM-5 Guidebook

3. Interpersonal functioning.
4. Impulse control.

B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal
and social situations.
C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least
to adolescence or early adulthood.
E. The enduring pattern is not better explained as a manifestation or consequence of
another mental disorder.
F. The enduring pattern is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance
(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma).

Criterion A

This item ensures that the “pattern of inner experience” meets several conditions.
First, the pattern is enduring and not transient. If it is of recent onset or is transient, it
may well be attributable to another mental or medical disorder. Next, the pattern de-
viates “markedly” from the expectations of the individual’s culture. This is a necessary
and important distinction because some cultures encourage or tolerate individual ex-
pressions not tolerated in another culture. For example, in some non-Western societ-
ies the concepts of possession and magical experience are celebrated; in Western
societies, these symptoms may be used to indicate a Cluster A personality disorder
(e.g., schizotypal personality disorder).
The pattern must be manifested in two or more of four areas: cognition, affectivity,
interpersonal functioning, and impulse control. This requirement means that the in-
dividual’s symptoms or behaviors are not confined to a single domain. Typically,
most individuals who meet criteria for a personality disorder have involvement in
multiple symptom domains. For example, an individual with borderline personality
disorder may have problems maintaining stable interpersonal relationships, have ex-
treme difficulty regulating his or her emotions, have poor impulse control, and com-
mit acts of self-harm.

Criteria B, C, and D

These criteria ensure that the pattern is “pervasive across a broad range of personal
and social situations,” is impairing, and is stable and enduring. In short, the person-
ality difficulties are not confined to a single domain of functioning but affect most life
domains (home, school, workplace). For example, the individual may have problems
interacting not just with immediate family but with coworkers, friends and acquain-
tances, and even strangers. As might be expected, these problems are upsetting and
distressing to individuals, even though they may be unaware of their own role in cre-
ating difficulties for themselves. Their personality disorder can prevent the formation
or maintenance of stable interpersonal relationships, can contribute to job loss, and


**_Personality Disorders_** **393**

can contribute to overall unhappiness. Impairment occurs along a continuum as with
most mental disorders. At the extreme end, the person may be unable to function
without assistance because of near constant self-harm (borderline personality disor-
der) or because of uncontrolled criminal conduct that leads to incarceration (anti-
social personality disorder). At the milder end, a person may function well in the
workplace but be unable to maintain romantic attachments because of his or her ri-
gidity and stubbornness (obsessive-compulsive personality disorder).
Criterion D requires that the pattern be stable and of long duration. A personality
disorder is not considered time-limited or transitory. This requirement appears true
for most individuals whose personality disorder is evident by late adolescence or
early adulthood. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder have an even earlier
onset, with behavioral problems having an onset prior to age 15 years (diagnosed in
youth as conduct disorder). As a general rule, personality disorders tend to lessen in
severity (or “burn out”) with age. Longitudinal studies have shown, for instance, that
persons with antisocial and borderline personality disorders have progressively fewer
symptoms over time. At follow-up many will no longer meet full diagnostic criteria,
yet symptoms remain that can nonetheless be impairing. This may be less true for other
personality disorder types, such as obsessive-compulsive and schizotypal personal-
ity disorders. Further, because the problems associated with personality disorders
tend to be at their most severe during formative periods in a person’s life—when most
people are completing their education, marrying and starting a family, and establish-
ing a career—even when improved, many individuals with personality disorders
never “catch up” educationally, socially, or economically with their peers who do not
have personality disorders.

Criteria E and F

These are the “rule out” criteria meant to ensure that the clinician has ruled out other
potential causes for the personality disturbance. Other mental disorders can induce
personality changes. For instance, in the early phases of schizophrenia, individuals
can develop symptoms that resemble those often attributed to a personality disorder,
such as social withdrawal, magical thinking, impulsive acts, or mild suspiciousness,
all occurring in the absence of frank hallucinations or delusions. The person with ma-
jor depressive disorder can become socially withdrawn, develop low self-esteem, lack
self-confidence, and become dependent on others even for simple decisions. These
traits should be attributed to the major depression unless they clearly predate the on-
set of the depression and are part of an enduring pattern of experience and behavior.
In contrast, other medical disorders also must be ruled out as a cause of the per-
sonality pattern. Persons who use alcohol or other drugs excessively can develop
symptoms suggesting a personality disorder—for example, drug-seeking behaviors
that lead them to become irresponsible, to lie, or to commit crimes, or to become ap-
athetic, erratic, or impulsive. Brain lesions, such as those caused by tumors or strokes,
can contribute to the development of emotional lability, impulsive behavior, suspi-
ciousness, or apathy.

CLUSTER A PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Paranoid Personality Disorder

_Paranoid personality disorder_ describes individuals who are chronically suspicious and
distrust others. In response to paranoid beliefs, they can be irritable, hostile, and
avoidant. They can develop hypervigilance toward their environment, finding con-
spiracies against them wherever they look.
Paranoid personality disorder was introduced in DSM-I and has continued to be
included in all subsequent DSM editions. Adolf Meyer is often credited with intro-
ducing the concept of paranoid personality, but other psychiatrists writing at the turn
of the twentieth century, including Kraepelin, Bleuler, and Freud, provided early de-
scriptions. Research suggests that paranoid personality disorder lies within the
schizophrenia spectrum and results from a common genetic predisposition.

Diagnostic Criteria for Paranoid Personality Disorder **301.0 (F60.0)**

A. A pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their motives are in-
terpreted as malevolent, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of
contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:

1. Suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming, or de-
    ceiving him or her.
2. Is preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of
    friends or associates.
3. Is reluctant to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information
    will be used maliciously against him or her.
4. Reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or
    events.
5. Persistently bears grudges (i.e., is unforgiving of insults, injuries, or slights).
6. Perceives attacks on his or her character or reputation that are not apparent to
    others and is quick to react angrily or to counterattack.
7. Has recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding fidelity of spouse or
    sexual partner.

B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder
or depressive disorder with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder and
is not attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.

**Note:** If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” i.e., “par-
anoid personality disorder (premorbid).”

Schizoid Personality Disorder

Schizoid personality disorder describes people who have difficulty achieving inti-
macy or developing emotionally meaningful relationships. People with schizoid per-


**_Personality Disorders_** **395**

sonality disorder choose solitary activities and tend to have no close relationships,
including with family members. These individuals rarely experience strong emo-
tions, express little desire for sexual intimacy with another person, tend to be indif-
ferent to praise or criticism, and display a constricted affect. Individuals with schizoid
personality disorder may come across to others as dull, emotionally constricted, and
aloof.
Schizoid personality disorder was introduced in DSM-I and has continued to be
included in all subsequent DSM editions. DSM-I and DSM-II emphasized the pres-
ence of autistic magical thinking, which is now considered a symptom of schizotypal
personality disorder. The disorder is not diagnosed in persons with schizophrenia or
other psychotic disorders because these conditions are typically accompanied by a se-
clusive lifestyle.
The disorder is uncommon in psychiatric settings because persons with this per-
sonality disorder rarely seek care. The distinction between schizoid and avoidant per-
sonality disorder can sometimes be difficult to make, but it rests on the motivation
underlying the person’s tendency to avoid interpersonal relationships.

Diagnostic Criteria for Schizoid Personality Disorder **301.20 (F60.1)**

A. A pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range
of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings, beginning by early adulthood
and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:

1. Neither desires nor enjoys close relationships, including being part of a family.
2. Almost always chooses solitary activities.
3. Has little, if any, interest in having sexual experiences with another person.
4. Takes pleasure in few, if any, activities.
5. Lacks close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives.
6. Appears indifferent to the praise or criticism of others.
7. Shows emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affectivity.

B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder
or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or au-
tism spectrum disorder and is not attributable to the physiological effects of an-
other medical condition.
**Note:** If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” i.e.,
“schizoid personality disorder (premorbid).”

Schizotypal Personality Disorder

Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of peculiar behavior,
odd speech and thinking, and unusual perceptual experiences. People with these symp-
toms may appear odd and unusual, but they are not psychotic. The disorder was new
to DSM-III, its inclusion prompted by evidence that relatives of individuals with


**396** DSM-5 Guidebook

schizophrenia often displayed a cluster of schizophrenic-like traits, observations
noted earlier by Kraepelin and Bleuler. Genetic and neurophysiological evidence later
confirmed membership of this disorder within the schizophrenia spectrum.
Because a certain proportion of people diagnosed with schizotypal personality
disorder develop schizophrenia, it may be more appropriate to understand their
schizotypal traits as early (or prodromal) manifestations of schizophrenia. This can be
coded by adding “(premorbid)” after the diagnosis in a person who has developed
schizophrenia. Attenuated psychosis syndrome, described in Chapter 22, “Conditions
for Further Study,” and autism spectrum disorder, described in Chapter 3, “Neurode-
velopmental Disorders,” may be other diagnostic considerations.
The placement of schizotypal personality disorder alongside the psychotic disor-
ders was debated during the development of DSM-IV. The decision at that time was
to follow convention and keep schizotypal personality disorder in the personality
disorders chapter, recognizing that other personality disorders also have spectrum re-
lationships (e.g., avoidant personality disorder and anxiety disorders, borderline per-
sonality disorder and mood disorders). These arguments were revisited during DSM-
5 deliberations, and the Psychotic Disorders Work Group recommended that the dis-
order be moved to the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disor-
ders” as part of a general reorganization. As mentioned earlier, the text and criteria
remain in this chapter and are unchanged from DSM-IV.
Schizotypal personality disorder is common and has a relatively stable course,
with onset in childhood. It is often found in offspring of people with schizophrenia.
Some individuals who meet this description in adolescence will go on to develop
schizophrenia. After the age of risk for schizophrenia, typical individuals with schizo-
typal personality disorder rarely develop schizophrenia, and the symptoms may di-
minish with advancing age.

Diagnostic Criteria for Schizotypal
Personality Disorder **301.22 (F21)**

A. A pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort
with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by cognitive or per-
ceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior, beginning by early adulthood
and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:

1. Ideas of reference (excluding delusions of reference).
2. Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is inconsistent with
    subcultural norms (e.g., superstitiousness, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, or
    “sixth sense”; in children and adolescents, bizarre fantasies or preoccupations).
3. Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions.
4. Odd thinking and speech (e.g., vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelab-
    orate, or stereotyped).
5. Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation.
6. Inappropriate or constricted affect.


**_Personality Disorders_** **397**

7. Behavior or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or peculiar.
8. Lack of close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives.
9. Excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with familiarity and tends to be
    associated with paranoid fears rather than negative judgments about self.

B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder
or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism
spectrum disorder.

**Note:** If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” e.g.,
“schizotypal personality disorder (premorbid).”

CLUSTER B PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Antisocial Personality Disorder

Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of poor social
conformity, deceitfulness, impulsivity, criminality, and lack of remorse. The disorder
is common, with a 12-month prevalence in the general population estimated at 3.3%.
The disorder is more common in men than in women and is frequent in psychiatric
and correctional settings.
Although descriptions of antisocial personality disorder date to the early nineteenth
century, formal descriptions date to DSM-I, which included the category “sociopathic
personality disturbance” to describe a variety of “reactions” (including antisocial re-
action) that placed individuals in conflict with society. Antisocial personality disorder
came into its own in DSM-II as a specific type of personality disorder, although it was
only with DSM-III that diagnostic criteria were developed. The criteria were strongly
influenced by the work of Lee Robins and her colleagues at Washington University
(Black 2013). The disorder was described as consisting of an explicit set of irresponsi-
ble behaviors and antisocial acts, such as an inability to maintain consistent employ-
ment, illegal and aggressive behavior, and sexual promiscuity. The focus on behavioral
traits has been a bone of contention ever since among clinicians and researchers who
believe the criteria ignore the disorder’s underlying psychological traits. Partly in re-
sponse to these concerns, “lack of remorse” was added as a symptom in DSM-III-R. The
criteria were simplified for DSM-IV, in part on the basis of results from data reanaly-
ses and field trials, and are unchanged in DSM-5.
Individuals with this disorder may have little sense of responsibility, lack judgment,
blame others, and rationalize their behaviors. Many people with antisocial personality
disorder engage in criminal acts and are caught up in the criminal justice system. Do-
mestic violence is common and divorce frequent. In the most severe cases, the indi-
vidual may show a disturbing degree of callousness and amorality.


**398** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder **301.7 (F60.2)**

A. A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, occurring
since age 15 years, as indicated by three (or more) of the following:

1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors, as indicated
    by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest.
2. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others
    for personal profit or pleasure.
3. Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead.
4. Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or as-
    saults.
5. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others.
6. Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consis-
    tent work behavior or honor financial obligations.
7. Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having
    hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.

B. The individual is at least age 18 years.
C. There is evidence of conduct disorder with onset before age 15 years.
D. The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Borderline Personality Disorder

Although the term has a much longer history, borderline personality disorder was
first included in DSM-III as a syndrome of profound identity disturbance, unstable
moods, and difficult interpersonal relationships. Precursors were _emotionally unstable
personality_ in DSM-I and _explosive personality_ in DSM-II. The criteria were slightly
modified for DSM-III-R and DSM-IV and are unchanged in DSM-5. Core symptoms
include a pervasive pattern of anger dyscontrol, affective instability, impulsive be-
havior, and unstable and overly intense interpersonal relationships.
Borderline personality disorder is one of the more common personality disorders,
having a prevalence of 1.6%–5.9% in the general population; it is more frequent in
women. Individuals with borderline personality disorder often hurt themselves—for
example, by cutting or burning—and frequently attempt suicide. An estimated 8%–
10% of persons with borderline personality disorder eventually commit suicide.

Diagnostic Criteria for Borderline Personality
Disorder **301.83 (F60.3)**

A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and af-
fects, and marked impulsivity, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety
of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:


**_Personality Disorders_** **399**

1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. ( **Note:** Do not include sui-
    cidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)
2. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by al-
    ternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.
3. Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.
4. Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending,
    sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating). ( **Note:** Do not include sui-
    cidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)
5. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior.
6. Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dyspho-
    ria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few
    days).
7. Chronic feelings of emptiness.
8. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays
    of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).
9. Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.

Histrionic Personality Disorder

Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of excessive emotionality
and attention-seeking behavior and includes such symptoms as excessive concern
with appearance and wanting to be the center of attention. Histrionic persons can be
gregarious and charming but can also be manipulative, vain, and demanding.
The disorder takes its name from _hysteria_ , a condition first described in the nine-
teenth century and associated with conversion, somatization, and dissociation symp-
toms. Self-dramatizing and attention-seeking behaviors were considered to be associ-
ated with hysteria. _Hysterical personality_ was included in DSM-II and was renamed
_histrionic personality disorder_ in DSM-III so as not to be confused with hysteria (renamed
_somatization disorder_ ). The disorder has a prevalence of nearly 2% in the general popu-
lation and is more frequently diagnosed in women.

Diagnostic Criteria for Histrionic Personality
Disorder **301.50 (F60.4)**

A pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking, beginning by
early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of
the following:

1. Is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of attention.
2. Interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive
    or provocative behavior.
3. Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions.
4. Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self.
5. Has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail.


**400** DSM-5 Guidebook

6. Shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion.
7. Is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances).
8. Considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are.

Narcissistic Personality Disorder

Narcissistic personality disorder is named for Narcissus, from Greek mythology, who
fell in love with his own reflection. Freud used the term to describe persons who were
self-absorbed, and psychoanalysts have focused on the narcissist’s need to bolster his
or her self-esteem through grandiose fantasy, exaggerated ambition, exhibitionism,
and feelings of entitlement. The disorder was first included in DSM-III, and the crite-
ria were modified for DSM-III-R and DSM-IV. The criteria for narcissistic personality
disorder are unchanged in DSM-5. The prevalence of this disorder may be as high as
6.2% in the general population, and most persons receiving the diagnosis are male.

Diagnostic Criteria for Narcissistic Personality
Disorder **301.81 (F60.81)**

A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and
lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as
indicated by five (or more) of the following:

1. Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and tal-
    ents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements).
2. Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or
    ideal love.
3. Believes that he or she is “special” and unique and can only be understood by, or
    should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions).
4. Requires excessive admiration.
5. Has a sense of entitlement (i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable
    treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations).
6. Is interpersonally exploitative (i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her
    own ends).
7. Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of oth-
    ers.
8. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her.
9. Shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes.

CLUSTER C PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Avoidant Personality Disorder

Avoidant personality disorder was introduced in DSM-III and was created to distin-
guish individuals who avoid social interaction because of fears of rejection, from in-


**_Personality Disorders_** **401**

dividuals with either a schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder who have an im-
paired capacity for social relatedness. Predecessors include schizoid personality in
DSM-I and DSM-II and inadequate personality in DSM-II. The latter term was used
to describe individuals who had experienced failure in several important life domains,
such as interpersonal relationships and occupations. The criteria for avoidant person-
ality disorder are unchanged in DSM-5.
Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by low self-esteem, reluctance to
engage in new activities, avoidance of social activities and interpersonal interactions,
anxious preoccupation with social evaluation, and a general lack of positive engage-
ment. Many of these traits are present from early childhood, and they typically persist
into adulthood but become less evident with age. There is considerable overlap with
several of the anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia. The
disorder is equally prevalent in men and women, with an overall prevalence in the
general population of 2.4%.

Diagnostic Criteria for Avoidant Personality Disorder **301.82 (F60.6)**

A pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to
negative evaluation, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts,
as indicated by four (or more) of the following:

1. Avoids occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact be-
    cause of fears of criticism, disapproval, or rejection.
2. Is unwilling to get involved with people unless certain of being liked.
3. Shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of being shamed
    or ridiculed.
4. Is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations.
5. Is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy.
6. Views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others.
7. Is unusually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new activities be-
    cause they may prove embarrassing.

Dependent Personality Disorder

Dependent personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of relying excessively
on others for emotional support and making everyday decisions. The disorder was listed
as a subtype of the DSM-I passive-aggressive personality, was omitted from DSM-II,
and was subsequently reintroduced in DSM-III. Psychoanalytically oriented clini-
cians have linked dependency to fixation at the oral stage of development, which fo-
cuses on the biological gratification that arises from feeding. Other experts have tied
dependent personality to the disruption of attachments early in life, or to overprotec-
tion and parental authoritarianism experienced in childhood. Dependent personality
disorder has a prevalence of around 0.5% in the general population and is diagnosed
more frequently in women.


**402** DSM-5 Guidebook

There have been few empirical studies of dependent personality disorder. Some
experts believe the disorder is not sufficiently distinctive to stand alone and point to
the fact that dependency on others commonly occurs in people with other personality
disorder types and in persons with chronic medical or mental disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Dependent Personality
Disorder **301.6 (F60.7)**

A pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and
clinging behavior and fears of separation, beginning by early adulthood and present
in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:

1. Has difficulty making everyday decisions without an excessive amount of advice
    and reassurance from others.
2. Needs others to assume responsibility for most major areas of his or her life.
3. Has difficulty expressing disagreement with others because of fear of loss of sup-
    port or approval. ( **Note:** Do not include realistic fears of retribution.)
4. Has difficulty initiating projects or doing things on his or her own (because of a lack
    of self-confidence in judgment or abilities rather than a lack of motivation or en-
    ergy).
5. Goes to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others, to the
    point of volunteering to do things that are unpleasant.
6. Feels uncomfortable or helpless when alone because of exaggerated fears of be-
    ing unable to care for himself or herself.
7. Urgently seeks another relationship as a source of care and support when a close
    relationship ends.
8. Is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to take care of himself or her-
    self.

Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is one of the older personality disorders,
having originated with Freud’s formulation of the anal character whose symptoms
are orderliness, parsimony, and obstinacy. Compulsive personality was included in
DSM-I, and the name was changed to obsessive compulsive personality in DSM-II.
The description emphasized conformity and adherence to standards, rigidity, over-
conscientiousness, and inability to relax, which were thought to predispose to “obses-
sive compulsive neurosis” (i.e., obsessive-compulsive disorder). In DSM-II, the disorder
was parenthetically called “anankastic personality.” The criteria had minor modifica-
tions in DSM-III-R and DSM-IV; they are unchanged in DSM-5. Obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder is conceptualized as a chronic maladaptive pattern of excessive
perfectionism, preoccupation with orderliness and detail, and need for control of
one’s emotions and environment that contributes to significant distress or impair-
ment, particularly in the areas of interpersonal functioning. The disorder is relatively


**_Personality Disorders_** **403**

common, having a prevalence in the general population that may be as high as 7.9%.
It occurs more commonly in men than in women.

Diagnostic Criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive
Personality Disorder **301.4 (F60.5)**

A pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and
interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning
by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more)
of the following:

1. Is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the ex-
    tent that the major point of the activity is lost.
2. Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is unable to com-
    plete a project because his or her own overly strict standards are not met).
3. Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities
    and friendships (not accounted for by obvious economic necessity).
4. Is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics,
    or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification).
5. Is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no senti-
    mental value.
6. Is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly
    his or her way of doing things.
7. Adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as
    something to be hoarded for future catastrophes.
8. Shows rigidity and stubbornness.

OTHER PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Personality Change Due to

Another Medical Condition

This category was moved from DSM-IV’s “Mental Disorders Due to a General Medi-
cal Condition.” The predominant problem is a persistent personality disturbance, or
change, that is attributed to another medical condition such as a frontal lobe lesion.
With this condition, the disturbance represents a change from the individual’s usual
personality pattern. (In children, the period of change lasts at least 1 year.) Medical
evaluation has established that the personality change has been brought about by a
medical condition, and the change does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium. Finally, the change causes distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning.
Commonly observed manifestations consistent with the personality change in-
clude mood instability, poor impulse control, aggressive outbursts, apathy, suspicious-


**404** DSM-5 Guidebook

ness, and paranoid ideations. Others may see the person as being not himself or herself.
The nature of the symptoms may differ markedly from person to person depending
on the location of the brain lesion or the pathophysiological process underlying the
disturbance. Clinicians may specify the predominant pattern or symptoms (e.g., la-
bile type).

Diagnostic Criteria for Personality Change
Due to Another Medical Condition **310.1 (F07.0)**

A. A persistent personality disturbance that represents a change from the individual’s
previous characteristic personality pattern.
**Note:** In children, the disturbance involves a marked deviation from normal devel-
opment or a significant change in the child’s usual behavior patterns, lasting at
least 1 year.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical
condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (including an-
other mental disorder due to another medical condition).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify whether:
**Labile type:** If the predominant feature is affective lability.
**Disinhibited type:** If the predominant feature is poor impulse control as evidenced
by sexual indiscretions, etc.
**Aggressive type:** If the predominant feature is aggressive behavior.
**Apathetic type:** If the predominant feature is marked apathy and indifference.
**Paranoid type:** If the predominant feature is suspiciousness or paranoid ideation.
**Other type:** If the presentation is not characterized by any of the above subtypes.
**Combined type:** If more than one feature predominates in the clinical picture.
**Unspecified type**

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition (e.g., 310.1 [F07.0] per-
sonality change due to temporal lobe epilepsy). The other medical condition should
be coded and listed separately immediately before the personality disorder due to an-
other medical condition (e.g., 345.40 [G40.209] temporal lobe epilepsy; 310.1 [F07.0]
personality change due to temporal lobe epilepsy).

Other Specified Personality Disorder and

Unspecified Personality Disorder

These categories are used when an individual has symptoms of a personality disorder
that cause distress and impairment but do not meet the full criteria for any of the more


**_Personality Disorders_** **405**

specific disorders in the class. In these situations, the clinician has judged that the
general personality disorder criteria have been met.
The category other specified personality disorder is used when the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the cri-
teria. Clinicians are encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., mixed personality
features).

Other Specified Personality Disorder **301.89 (F60.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a personal-
ity disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation-
al, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria
for any of the disorders in the personality disorders diagnostic class. The other specified
personality disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any
specific personality disorder. This is done by recording “other specified personality dis-
order” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “mixed personality features”).

The category unspecified personality disorder is used when the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason why the criteria are not met for a specific personality disor-
der and when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Unspecified Personality Disorder **301.9 (F60.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a person-
ality disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the personality disorders diagnostic class. The unspec-
ified personality disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific personality disorder,
and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

- The DSM-IV criteria for a general personality disorder and the ten specific dis-
    order types are unchanged in DSM-5. An alternative diagnostic scheme devel-
    oped by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group that
    combines categorical diagnosis with dimensional ratings of personality do-
    mains and traits is included in Section III (“Alternative DSM-5 Model for Person-
    ality Disorders”).


**406** DSM-5 Guidebook

- The multiaxial diagnostic system introduced in DSM-III has been discontinued.
    Personality disorders are now coded at the same level as other mental dis-
    orders. The three personality disorder clusters (i.e., Clusters A, B, C) are un-
    changed.
- Personality change due to another medical condition has been moved to this
    class from DSM-IV’s “Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition.” In
    DSM-5, disorders judged due to another medical disorder are placed in the
    class with which they share the predominant symptom pattern.
- The diagnosis personality disorder not otherwise specified has been replaced
    by other specified personality disorder and unspecified personality disorder.
    These residual diagnoses can be used when an individual who otherwise meets
    the general personality disorder criteria does not meet criteria for one of the 10
    specific disorders and, in the case of unspecified personality disorder, when there
    is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

**408** DSM-5 Guidebook

This chapter includes conditions of clinical importance that may
be a focus of diagnosis and treatment but are not considered mental disorders. These in-
clude 1) medication-induced movement disorders and other adverse effects of medica-
tion, and 2) other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention (V/Z codes). All of
these conditions have the potential to cause great distress to patients or their family mem-
bers. While these conditions are common, their codes are underutilized by clinicians.
The use of these codes is important because they represent conditions that either
are important in their own right or can adversely affect the course of a mental disorder.
For example, when a patient with schizophrenia refuses medication or takes it spo-
radically because of lack of insight or denial, that condition (V15.81/Z91.19 nonad-
herence to medical treatment) complicates the individual’s treatment and should be
coded in addition to the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Recording the codes for condi-
tions not thought to be mental disorders may also be useful simply to enable clini-
cians to note the individual’s reason for contact with the mental health care system.

MEDICATION NDUCED OVEMENT ISORDERS

AND OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS OF MEDICATION

-I M D

DSM-IV introduced the subcategory medication-induced movement disorders be-
cause of the importance of such disorders to treatment and differential diagnosis.
DSM-5 has given them their own chapter and expanded the title. These diagnoses can
be used to describe problems that patients sometimes develop with medications. Anti-
psychotic medications are the most common offenders, and they are widely known to
induce movement disorders in some patients. Movement disorders range from trou-
blesome but reversible (akathisia), to disabling and irreversible (tardive dyskinesia),
to even fatal in some cases (neuroleptic malignant syndrome [NMS]). Their inclusion
in DSM-5 may help boost their recognition and treatment, and help with differential
diagnosis. For example, medication-induced acute akathisia needs to be distin-
guished from anxiety disorders, whereas NMS needs to be distinguished from cata-
tonia. Many of the symptoms reported in patients with an akathisia (e.g., anxiety,
jitteriness) are indistinguishable from symptoms of an anxiety disorder. Therefore,
the clinician must take a thorough history to determine the temporal relationship be-
tween medication and symptom onset and consider other possible causes.
The term _neuroleptic_ was introduced in the 1950s to highlight the antipsychotic and
extrapyramidal side effects of chlorpromazine, and was soon used to describe any an-
tipsychotic medication. With the introduction of the “atypical,” or second-generation,
antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine), which have a lower propen-
sity to cause extrapyramidal side effects, the term has become outdated, although it
remains appropriate when describing medication-induced abnormal movements.
Neuroleptic medications include both conventional (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperi-
dol, fluphenazine) and atypical antipsychotics; certain dopamine receptor–blocking
drugs used to treat nausea and gastroparesis (e.g., prochlorperazine, promethazine,
trimethobenzamide, thiethylperazine, metoclopramide); and amoxapine, which is
marketed as an antidepressant.

Neuroleptic-Induced Parkinsonism and

Other Medication-Induced Parkinsonism

Parkinsonian tremor, muscular rigidity, akinesia (i.e., loss of movement or difficulty
initiating movement), or bradykinesia (i.e., slowing movement) developing within a
few weeks of starting or raising the dosage of a medication (e.g., a neuroleptic) or af-
ter reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.


**410** DSM-5 Guidebook

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

Although neuroleptic malignant syndrome is easily recognized in its classic full-
blown form, it is often heterogeneous in onset, presentation, progression, and out-
come. The clinical features described below are those considered most important in
making the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome based on consensus recom-
mendations.
Patients have generally been exposed to a dopamine antagonist within 72 hours
prior to symptom development. Hyperthermia (100.4F or 38.0C on at least two
occasions, measured orally), associated with profuse diaphoresis, is a distinguishing
feature of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, setting it apart from other neurological
side effects of antipsychotic medications. Extreme elevations in temperature, reflect-
ing a breakdown in central thermoregulation, are more likely to support the diagnosis
of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Generalized rigidity, described as “lead pipe” in
its most severe form and usually unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agents, is a cardi-
nal feature of the disorder and may be associated with other neurological symptoms
(e.g., tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia, dystonia, trismus, myoclonus, dysarthria, dyspha-
gia, rhabdomyolysis). Creatine kinase elevation of at least four times the upper limit
of normal is commonly seen. Changes in mental status, characterized by delirium or
altered consciousness ranging from stupor to coma, are often an early sign. Affected
individuals may appear alert but dazed and unresponsive, consistent with catatonic
stupor. Autonomic activation and instability—manifested by tachycardia (rate25%
above baseline), diaphoresis, blood pressure elevation (systolic or diastolic 25%
above baseline) or fluctuation (20 mmHg diastolic change or 25 mmHg systolic
change within 24 hours), urinary incontinence, and pallor—may be seen at any time
but provide an early clue to the diagnosis. Tachypnea (rate 50% above baseline) is
common, and respiratory distress—resulting from metabolic acidosis, hypermetabo-
lism, chest wall restriction, aspiration pneumonia, or pulmonary emboli—can occur
and lead to sudden respiratory arrest.
A workup, including laboratory investigation, to exclude other infectious, toxic,
metabolic, and neuropsychiatric etiologies or complications is essential. Although sev-
eral laboratory abnormalities are associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, no
single abnormality is specific to the diagnosis. Individuals with neuroleptic malignant
syndrome may have leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, decreased serum iron
concentrations, and elevations in serum muscle enzymes and catecholamines. Findings
from cerebrospinal fluid analysis and neuroimaging studies are generally normal,
whereas electroencephalography shows generalized slowing. Autopsy findings in fatal
cases have been nonspecific and variable, depending on complications.

Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia

Abnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes (oculogyric crisis),
head, neck (torticollis or retrocollis), limbs, or trunk developing within a few days of
starting or raising the dosage of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing
the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.


**_Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Conditions_** **411**

Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia

Subjective complaints of restlessness, often accompanied by observed excessive move-
ments (e.g., fidgety movements of the legs, rocking from foot to foot, pacing, inability
to sit or stand still), developing within a few weeks of starting or raising the dosage
of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication
used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.

Tardive Dyskinesia

Involuntary athetoid or choreiform movements (lasting at least a few weeks) gener-
ally of the tongue, lower face and jaw, and extremities (but sometimes involving the
pharyngeal, diaphragmatic, or trunk muscles) developing in association with the use
of a neuroleptic medication for at least a few months.
Symptoms may develop after a shorter period of medication use in older persons.
In some patients, movements of this type may appear after discontinuation, or after
change or reduction in dosage, of neuroleptic medications, in which case the condi-
tion is called _neuroleptic withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia._ Because withdrawal-emergent
dyskinesia is usually time-limited, lasting less than 4–8 weeks, dyskinesia that persists
beyond this window is considered to be tardive dyskinesia.

Tardive Dystonia and Tardive Akathisia

Tardive syndrome involving other types of movement problems, such as dystonia or
akathisia, which are distinguished by their late emergence in the course of treatment
and their potential persistence for months to years, even in the face of neuroleptic dis-
continuation or dosage reduction.

Medication-Induced Postural Tremor

Fine tremor (usually in the range of 8–12 Hz) occurring during attempts to maintain
a posture and developing in association with the use of medication (e.g., lithium, an-
tidepressants, valproate). This tremor is very similar to the tremor seen with anxiety,
caffeine, and other stimulants.

Other Medication-Induced Movement Disorder

This category is for medication-induced movement disorders not captured by any of
the specific disorders listed above. Examples include 1) presentations resembling
neuroleptic malignant syndrome that are associated with medications other than
neuroleptics and 2) other medication-induced tardive conditions.


**412** DSM-5 Guidebook

Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome

```
Initial Encounter
Subsequent Encounter
Sequelae
```
Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a set of symptoms that can occur after
an abrupt cessation (or marked reduction in dose) of an antidepressant medication
that was taken continuously for at least 1 month. Symptoms generally begin within
2–4 days and typically include specific sensory, somatic, and cognitive-emotional
manifestations. Frequently reported sensory and somatic symptoms include flashes
of light, “electric shock” sensations, nausea, and hyperresponsivity to noises or lights.
Nonspecific anxiety and feelings of dread may also be reported. Symptoms are alle-
viated by restarting the same medication or starting a different medication that has a
similar mechanism of action—for example, discontinuation symptoms after with-
drawal from a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor may be alleviated by
starting a tricyclic antidepressant. To qualify as antidepressant discontinuation syn-
drome, the symptoms should not have been present before the antidepressant dosage
was reduced and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., manic or
hypomanic episode, substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, somatic symptom
disorder).
Discontinuation symptoms may occur following treatment with tricyclic antide-
pressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine), serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g.,
phenelzine, selegiline, pargyline). The incidence of this syndrome depends on the
dosage and half-life of the medication being taken, as well as the rate at which the
medication is tapered. Short-acting medications that are stopped abruptly rather than
tapered gradually may pose the greatest risk. The short-acting selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is the agent most commonly associated with dis-
continuation symptoms, but such symptoms occur for all types of antidepressants.
Unlike withdrawal syndromes associated with opioids, alcohol, and other sub-
stances of abuse, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome has no pathognomonic
symptoms. Instead, the symptoms tend to be vague and variable and typically begin
2–4 days after the last dose of the antidepressant. For SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine), symp-
toms such as dizziness, ringing in the ears, “electric shocks in the head,” an inability
to sleep, and acute anxiety are described. The antidepressant use prior to discontinu-
ation must not have incurred hypomania or euphoria (i.e., there should be confidence
that the discontinuation syndrome is not the result of fluctuations in mood stability
associated with the previous treatment). The antidepressant discontinuation syn-
drome is based solely on pharmacological factors and is not related to the reinforcing
effects of an antidepressant. Also, in the case of stimulant augmentation of an antide-
pressant, abrupt cessation may result in stimulant withdrawal symptoms (see “Stim-
ulant Withdrawal” in Chapter 16, “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders”)
rather than the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome described here.

A FOCUS OF CLINICAL ATTENTION

C T M B

DSM authors have long recognized that certain problems may motivate people to
seek psychiatric care but that these conditions are not mental illnesses. In DSM-II,
problems experienced by people who were considered psychiatrically healthy that were
sufficiently severe to warrant a visit to a psychiatrist were assigned to the category
“conditions without manifest psychiatric disorder and non-specific conditions.” This
category included, for instance, marital maladjustment, occupational maladjustment,
and dyssocial behavior (e.g., for professional criminals who did not have antisocial
personality disorder). In DSM-III, the authors expanded the list and provided greater
specificity for the various problems not considered attributable to a mental disorder.
These were “V code” diagnoses, using wording taken from ICD-9-CM, which includes
the codes listed in a section called “Supplementary Classification of Factors Influencing
Health Status and Contact With Health Services.” (The letter _V_ has no special signif-
icance when used in this context.)
In DSM-IV, V code diagnoses were grouped as 1) relational problems; 2) problems
related to abuse or neglect (including the physical and sexual abuse of children and
adults and neglect of a child); and 3) additional conditions, including noncompliance
with treatment, malingering, adult antisocial behavior, child or adolescent antisocial
behavior, borderline intellectual functioning, age-related cognitive decline, bereave-
ment, academic problem, occupational problem, identity problem, religious or spiritual
problem, acculturation problem, and phase of life problem. Boundaries were created
to distinguish bereavement from major depressive disorder.
In addition to the subcategories relational problems and abuse and neglect, new sub-
categories in DSM-5 are educational and occupational problems; housing and economic
problems; other problems related to the social environment; problems related to crime
or interaction with the legal system; other health service encounters for counseling or
medical advice; problems related to other psychosocial, personal, and environmental
circumstances; and other circumstances of personal history. In DSM-5, the term _uncom-
plicated bereavement_ has been restored (V62.82/Z63.4), but those who develop a major
depressive episode in response to the death of a loved one should receive the diagnosis
of major depressive disorder (see Chapter 5, “Mood Disorders,” for further discussion).


**414** DSM-5 Guidebook

With DSM-5, several additional changes have been made. First, each disorder has
also been provided with a dual “Z code” diagnosis, the letter used in the coding for
these conditions in ICD-10-CM, expected to become operational in October 2014. As
with the letter _V,_ the letter _Z_ has no special significance in this context. Hence, in this
chapter, and throughout the book, we refer to these conditions as “V/Z code” diagno-
ses. In confirmed or suspected cases of child, spouse/partner, or adult neglect, or psy-
chological, physical, or sexual violence, a 995 code is used (a T code in the ICD-10-CM
system).
With the discontinuation of the multiaxial diagnostic scheme, stressors that for-
merly would have been recorded on Axis IV may now be recognized by using the V/
Z codes. The expanded list in DSM-5 allows for a more complete description of situ-
ations that are relevant to seeking care but are not attributable to a mental illness, such
as homelessness, extreme poverty, or being the victim of a crime.
A listing of other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention, along with
ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes, is given in Table 19–2.

Relational Problems

To encourage the use of these diagnoses by clinicians, the section was reorganized and
expanded for DSM-5. Relational problems are accorded much greater specificity, and in-
stead of five diagnoses as in DSM-IV, there are now eight. This category concerns pat-
terns of interaction between members of a relational unit. The patterns are associated
with symptoms or significant impairment in functioning in one or more individual
members or with significant impairment of the relational unit itself. The category should
be of special interest to clinicians engaged in family and couples therapy.
Key relationships, especially intimate adult partner relationships and parent/
caregiver–child relationships have a significant impact on the health of the individu-
als in these relationships. These relationships can be health promoting and protective,
neutral, or detrimental to health outcomes. In the extreme, these close relationships can
be associated with maltreatment or neglect, which has significant medical and psycho-
logical consequences for the affected individual. A relational problem may come to
clinical attention either as the reason that the individual seeks health care or as a prob-
lem that affects the course, prognosis, or treatment of the individual’s mental or other
medical disorder.

Abuse and Neglect

The section on problems related to abuse or neglect was added in DSM-IV in part due
to the clinical and public health significance of the conditions. This section has been
further expanded in DSM-5. Readers should note that different diagnostic codes are
given on the basis of the focus of clinical attention. If the problem is addressed in the
context of the family or relational unit, the V/Z code is used. If the focus is on the vic-
tim, the 995 code (or a T code in ICD-10-CM) is used.
Maltreatment by a family member (e.g., caregiver, intimate adult partner) or by a
nonrelative can be the area of current clinical focus, or such maltreatment can be an
important factor in the assessment and treatment of patients with mental or other
medical disorders. Because of the legal implications of abuse and neglect, care should


**422** DSM-5 Guidebook

be used in assessing these conditions and assigning these codes. Having a past history
of abuse or neglect can influence diagnosis and treatment response in a number of
mental disorders, and may also be noted along with the diagnosis.

Child Maltreatment and Neglect Problems

**Child Physical Abuse**

Child physical abuse is nonaccidental physical injury to a child—ranging from minor
bruises to severe fractures or death—occurring as a result of punching, beating, kick-
ing, biting, shaking, throwing, stabbing, choking, hitting (with a hand, stick, strap, or
other object), burning, or any other method that is inflicted by a parent, caregiver, or
other individual who has responsibility for the child. Such injury is considered abuse
regardless of whether the caregiver intended to hurt the child. Physical discipline, such
as spanking or paddling, is not considered abuse as long as it is reasonable and causes
no bodily injury to the child.

tal child abuse

**Child Sexual Abuse**

Child sexual abuse encompasses any sexual act involving a child that is intended to
provide sexual gratification to a parent, caregiver, or other individual who has re-
sponsibility for the child. Sexual abuse includes activities such as fondling a child’s
genitals, penetration, incest, rape, sodomy, and indecent exposure. Sexual abuse also
includes noncontact exploitation of a child by a parent or caregiver—for example,
forcing, tricking, enticing, threatening, or pressuring a child to participate in acts for
the sexual gratification of others, without direct physical contact between child and
abuser.

**Child Neglect**

Child neglect is defined as any confirmed or suspected egregious act or omission by
a child’s parent or other caregiver that deprives the child of basic age-appropriate
needs and thereby results, or has reasonable potential to result, in physical or psycho-
logical harm to the child. Child neglect encompasses abandonment; lack of appropri-
ate supervision; failure to attend to necessary emotional or psychological needs; and
failure to provide necessary education, medical care, nourishment, shelter, and/or
clothing.

**Child Psychological Abuse**

Child psychological abuse is nonaccidental verbal or symbolic acts by a child’s parent
or caregiver that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in significant psycho-
logical harm to the child. (Physical and sexual abusive acts are not included in this


**424** DSM-5 Guidebook

category.) Examples of psychological abuse of a child include berating, disparaging,
or humiliating the child; threatening the child; harming/abandoning—or indicating
that the alleged offender will harm/abandon—people or things that the child cares
about; confining the child (as by tying a child’s arms or legs together or binding a
child to furniture or another object, or confining a child to a small enclosed area [e.g.,
a closet]); egregious scapegoating of the child; coercing the child to inflict pain on
himself or herself; and disciplining the child excessively (i.e., at an extremely high fre-
quency or duration, even if not at a level of physical abuse) through physical or non-
physical means.

Adult Maltreatment and Neglect Problems

**Spouse or Partner Violence, Physical**

This category should be used when nonaccidental acts of physical force that result, or
have reasonable potential to result, in physical harm to an intimate partner or that
evoke significant fear in the partner have occurred during the past year. Nonacciden-
tal acts of physical force include shoving, slapping, hair pulling, pinching, restrain-
ing, shaking, throwing, biting, kicking, hitting with the fist or an object, burning,
poisoning, applying force to the throat, cutting off the air supply, holding the head
under water, and using a weapon. Acts for the purpose of physically protecting one-
self or one’s partner are excluded.

**Spouse or Partner Violence, Sexual**

This category should be used when forced or coerced sexual acts with an intimate
partner have occurred during the past year. Sexual violence may involve the use of
physical force or psychological coercion to compel the partner to engage in a sexual
act against his or her will, whether or not the act is completed. Also included in this
category are sexual acts with an intimate partner who is unable to consent.

**Spouse or Partner Neglect**

Partner neglect is any egregious act or omission in the past year by one partner that
deprives a dependent partner of basic needs and thereby results, or has reasonable po-
tential to result, in physical or psychological harm to the dependent partner. This cat-
egory is used in the context of relationships in which one partner is extremely
dependent on the other partner for care or for assistance in navigating ordinary daily
activities—for example, a partner who is incapable of self-care owing to substantial
physical, psychological/intellectual, or cultural limitations (e.g., inability to commu-
nicate with others and manage everyday activities due to living in a foreign culture).

**Spouse or Partner Abuse, Psychological**

Partner psychological abuse encompasses nonaccidental verbal or symbolic acts by
one partner that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in significant harm to
the other partner. This category should be used when such psychological abuse has
occurred during the past year. Acts of psychological abuse include berating or humil-
iating the victim; interrogating the victim; restricting the victim’s ability to come and
go freely; obstructing the victim’s access to assistance (e.g., law enforcement; legal,
protective, or medical resources); threatening the victim with physical harm or sexual
assault; harming, or threatening to harm, people or things that the victim cares about;
unwarranted restriction of the victim’s access to or use of economic resources; isolat-
ing the victim from family, friends, or social support resources; stalking the victim; and
trying to make the victim think that he or she is crazy.

**Adult Abuse by Nonspouse or Nonpartner**

This category should be used when an adult has been abused by another adult who
is not an intimate partner. Such maltreatment may involve acts of physical, sexual, or
emotional abuse. Examples of adult abuse include nonaccidental acts of physical
force (e.g., pushing/shoving, scratching, slapping, throwing something that could
hurt, punching, biting) that have resulted—or have reasonable potential to result—in
physical harm or have caused significant fear; forced or coerced sexual acts; and ver-
bal or symbolic acts with the potential to cause psychological harm (e.g., berating or
humiliating the person; interrogating the person; restricting the person’s ability to come
and go freely; obstructing the person’s access to assistance; threatening the person;
harming or threatening to harm people or things that the person cares about; restrict-


**_Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Conditions_** **427**

ing the person’s access to or use of economic resources; isolating the person from fam-
ily, friends, or social support resources; stalking the person; trying to make the person
think that he or she is crazy). Acts for the purpose of physically protecting oneself or
the other person are excluded.

Housing and Economic Problems

This is a new category created to acknowledge housing and economic problems that
many individuals experience. There are nine codes available to help describe the in-
dividual’s problem(s): homelessness; inadequate housing; discord with neighbor,
lodger, or landlord; problem related to living in a residential institution; lack of ade-
quate food or safe drinking water; extreme poverty; low income; insufficient social in-
surance or welfare support; and unspecified housing or economic problem.

Other Problems Related to the

Social Environment

There are six codes available in this category to better describe the individual’s life tran-
sition, social, and living problems: phase of life problem; problem related to living alone;
acculturation difficulty; social exclusion or rejection; target of (perceived) adverse dis-
crimination or persecution; and unspecified problem related to social environment.

Problems Related to Crime or

Interaction With the Legal System

This category is new and can be used to describe the individual’s problem(s) with the
legal system: victim of crime; conviction in civil or criminal proceedings without im-
prisonment; imprisonment or other incarceration; problems related to release from
prison; and problems related to other legal circumstances.

Other Health Service Encounters for

Counseling and Medical Advice

There are two codes available for use in individuals who seek sex counseling or other
counseling or consultation. While they may not have a mental illness, some persons will
seek counseling to receive sex education, to discuss problems related to their sexual
orientation (or their partners’), and other issues. Many people will also seek counsel-
ing for various reasons unrelated to mental health, such as spiritual counseling or di-
etary counseling.

Problems Related to Other Psychosocial,

Personal, and Environmental Circumstances

Eight codes are available in this category that includes problems related to psychoso-
cial, personal, and environmental concerns: religious or spiritual problem; problems
related to unwanted pregnancy; problems related to multiparity; discord with social ser-
vice provider, including probation officer, case manager, or social services worker; victim
of terrorism or torture; exposure to disaster, war, or other hostilities; other problem
related to psychosocial circumstances; and unspecified problem related to unspeci-
fied psychosocial circumstances.

V62.89 (Z65.8) Other Problem Related to Psychosocial Circumstances
V62.9 (Z65.9) Unspecified Problem Related to Unspecified Psychosocial Circum-
stances

Other Circumstances of Personal History

This category includes 14 codes to further describe problems related to personal history:
other personal history of psychological trauma; personal history of self-harm; personal


**430** DSM-5 Guidebook

history of military deployment; other personal risk factors; problem related to lifestyle;
adult antisocial behavior; child or adolescent antisocial behavior; unavailability or inac-
cessibility of health care facilities; unavailability or inaccessibility of other helping agen-
cies; nonadherence to medical treatment; overweight or obesity; malingering; wandering
associated with a mental disorder; and borderline intellectual functioning.
Of the seven conditions listed below, adult antisocial behavior has the longest his-
tory. Although such behavior is troublesome to the individual and the community, it
is not considered a mental disorder. Some individuals engage in antisocial acts, but
their behavior does not meet the criteria for antisocial personality disorder or conduct
disorder. Examples include people who pursue criminal careers, prostitutes, and pro-
fessional thieves. In the process of differential diagnosis, the clinician will need to dis-
tinguish adult antisocial behavior from antisocial personality disorder. The person with
antisocial personality disorder will have a history of conduct disorder.

V15.59 (Z91.5) Personal History of Self-Harm
V62.22 (Z91.82) Personal History of Military Deployment

V69.9 (Z72.9) Problem Related to Lifestyle
V71.01 (Z72.811) Adult Antisocial Behavior
V71.02 (Z72.810) Child or Adolescent Antisocial Behavior

Problems Related to Access to Medical and

Other Health Care

Two codes are used to describe the unavailability or inaccessibility of health care fa-
cilities, or the unavailability or inaccessibility of other helping agencies. These prob-
lems may be particularly problematic in rural areas or remote regions where health
care facilities are inadequate or lacking altogether.

V63.9 (Z75.3) Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Health Care Facilities
V63.8 (Z75.4) Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Other Helping Agencies

Nonadherence to Medical Treatment

Nonadherence to medical treatment is common and interferes with the clinician’s abil-
ity to help a patient. Although nonadherence per se is not considered a mental disor-
der, clinicians need to have an understanding of treatment adherence in general, and
more specifically in individual patients, whose motivations, concerns, and other issues
affect adherence, such as an individual’s denial of illness or lack of insight or possibly
patient concerns about treatment side effects.
_Overweight or obesity_ is new to DSM-5 and is a significant problem for many indi-
viduals who seek mental health care. Research has long shown a relationship between
overweight/obesity and mental disorders, and the problem is gaining in importance
as this condition becomes more frequent in the general population. Many psychotro-
pic medications are known to contribute to obesity and its associated metabolic prob-
lems such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Including this category may lead to better


**_Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Conditions_** **431**

recognition and reporting of overweight and obesity. This problem is coded as 278.00
(E66.9) rather than with a V/Z code.
_Malingering_ is another problem clinicians encounter, and it involves the intentional
production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms moti-
vated by external incentives (e.g., avoiding military conscription or duty, avoiding
work, evading criminal prosecution). Malingering is important to consider in the pro-
cess of differential diagnosis and should be suspected when any of the following clues
are present: medicolegal context of presentation (e.g., the person is referred by an attor-
ney); marked discrepancy between the person’s claimed disability and objective find-
ings; lack of cooperation during the diagnostic evaluation and noncompliance with the
treatment regimen; and the presence of an antisocial personality disorder.
_Wandering_ associated with a mental disorder is new to DSM-5, and is a category
used to describe people whose tendency to walk about leads to significant clinical
management or safety concerns. For example, individuals with major neurocognitive
or neurodevelopmental disorders may experience a restless urge to wander that places
them at risk for falls and causes them to leave supervised settings without needed ac-
companiment. This category is not meant to be used in those individuals whose intent
is to escape an unwanted housing situation (e.g., children who are running away
from home, patients who no longer wish to remain in the hospital) or those who walk
or pace as a result of medication-induced akathisia. Nor should this category used to
describe the individual with antisocial personality disorder whose _wanderlust_ leads
him to move from place to place without any particular goal or destination other than
to perhaps dodge past crimes and identities.
The category _borderline intellectual functioning_ can be used when the individual’s sub-
normal cognitive performance is the focus of clinical attention or has an impact on the
individual’s treatment or prognosis. Differentiating between borderline intellectual
functioning and an intellectual disability requires careful assessment that must take into
account both intellectual and adaptive functioning. Unlike DSM-IV, there is no longer an
IQ range specified to help identify borderline intellectual functioning. This condition is
important to acknowledge because an individual may benefit from efforts to optimize
academic achievement; to address difficulties with school, as well as social and work re-
lationships; and to develop functional skills and guidance in vocational training.

V15.81 (Z91.19) Nonadherence to Medical Treatment
278.00 (E66.9) Overweight or Obesity
V65.2 (Z76.5) Malingering
V40.31 (Z91.83) Wandering Associated With a Mental Disorder
V62.89 (R41.83) Borderline Intellectual Functioning

KEY POINTS

- The DSM-IV chapter “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention,”
    which included the V/Z/T code diagnoses, has been expanded for DSM-5, and
    the medication-induced movement disorders and other adverse effects of med-
    ication have been moved to their own chapter.


**432** DSM-5 Guidebook

- The codes included in this chapter are available to describe or denote condi-
    tions that are of clinical interest or concern but that are not considered mental
    disorders.
- Many of these conditions would have been listed on Axis IV of the multiaxial
    system in DSM-IV as “stressors” relevant to the care of the individual.
- Uncomplicated bereavement is available for use in bereaved individuals whose
    symptoms do not meet criteria for major depressive disorder.
- Overweight or obesity is a new category that may help lead to better recognition
    and reporting of this condition.

Cultural Formulation Interview

## Section III of DSM-5, “Emerging Measures and Models,” includes new

assessments and models that can be used by clinicians and researchers to provide a
more thorough evaluation of the patient. The measures and models, all of which are
optional, include the Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure, a list of Level 2 Cross-
Cutting Symptom Measures, the Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom
Severity scale, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0
(WHODAS 2.0). Level 2 severity measures are available online and may be used to ex-
plore significant responses to the Level 1 screen. The Cultural Formulation Interview,
a comprehensive review of the cultural context of mental disorders, is also provided.
The authors of DSM-5 aimed to integrate dimensional measures into the manual. The
goal was to enhance the assessment of symptom variation and severity, enabling the cli-
nician to provide a more complete evaluation of the patient to assist with treatment deci-
sions and in monitoring outcome. The goal was largely achieved with regard to several
major categories. For example, intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disor-
der) no longer is linked to specific IQ ranges; rather, the diagnosis depends on a dimen-
sional assessment of adaptive functioning, which is anchored to conceptual, social, and
practical domains (see Chapter 3, “Neurodevelopmental Disorders,” of this guidebook).
Another example is the decision to merge substance abuse and dependence into a single
“use” disorder rated according to severity, which ranges from mild (two to three symp-
toms) to severe (six or more symptoms). The most ambitious plan to incorporate di-
mensions was developed by the Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group.
Although their hybrid categorical-dimensional diagnostic system was not accepted for
inclusion in Section II, the scheme is included in Section III (and described in Chapter 21,
“Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders,” of this guidebook). Thus, DSM-5
places greater emphasis on dimensional measures compared with its predecessors, yet
categorical diagnosis remains its fundamental goal.

Level 1 and Level 2 Cross-Cutting

Symptom Measures

Cross-cutting symptom measures can serve as an approach for reviewing important
psychopathological domains, and they function as the equivalent of general medicine’s
review of systems. ( _Cross-cutting_ refers to the measure “cutting across” various psy-
chopathological domains.) A similar review of various mental functions can provide
a more complete mental status evaluation by drawing attention to symptoms that
may not be suggested by the individual’s presenting symptoms but are important to
the individual’s care. In DSM-5, cross-cutting measures have two levels: Level 1 ques-
tions are a brief survey of 13 symptom domains for adult patients and 12 domains for
child and adolescent patients. Level 2 questions provide a more in-depth assessment
of certain domains. The measures were developed to be administered initially and over
time to track the patient’s symptoms and treatment response.
New to DSM-5 is the Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. This patient- or in-
formant-rated measure can be used to assess mental health domains that are important
across psychiatric diagnoses. The adult version has 23 questions that assess 13 domains:
depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis,
sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality
functioning, and substance use. Each domain consists of one to three questions. Each
item inquires about how much (or how often) the individual has been bothered by the
specific symptoms during the past 2 weeks. The measure was found to be clinically
useful and to have good reliability in the DSM-5 field trials. A similar instrument for
children ages 6–17 years consisting of 25 questions assessing 12 psychiatric domains was
tested and found to have good reliability. The adult version of the measure is included
on the following pages and, along with the analogous child measure, is available at
[http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.](http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.)
Achieving threshold scores on the Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure can
indicate a need for a more detailed inquiry. Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures
can provide one way of obtaining more in-depth information on potentially signifi-
cant symptoms to inform diagnosis and treatment planning. These measures are
available online at [http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.](http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.) They include well-validated measures
such as the Patient Health Questionnaire 15-Item Somatic Symptom Severity Scale
and the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Severity Scale.

Clinician-Rated Dimensions of

Psychosis Symptom Severity

Because psychotic disorders are heterogeneous and symptom severity can predict im-
portant aspects of the illness, dimensional assessments can help capture meaningful
variation in symptom presentations. This can help with treatment planning, prognos-
tic decision-making, and research on pathophysiological mechanisms. The Clinician-
Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity can be used in the dimensional as-
sessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations, delusions,
and disorganized speech. The scale also assesses depression and mania. This eight-item
measure can be completed by the clinician or researcher at the time of assessment.
Each symptom is rated for current severity (past 7 days) on a 5-point scale (0: “Not
present” to 4: “Present and severe”). The scale can be used to rate any of the psychotic
disorders. The time frame is the past 7 days. The scale is shown below.

Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0

The adult self-administered version of the World Health Organization Disability As-
sessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) is a 36-item measure that assesses disability in
adults age 18 years and older. Six domains are assessed: understanding and communi-
cation; getting around; self-care; getting along with people; life activities (e.g., house-
hold activities); and participation in society. If the person is unable to complete the
form, a knowledgeable informant may complete the proxy-administered version. Both
are available at [http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.](http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.) Each version asks the individual to rate
how much difficulty he or she has had in the specific areas in the past 30 days.
There are two options for scoring. In a simple version of scoring, the scores assigned
to each item (none = 1, mild = 2, moderate = 3, severe = 4, and extreme = 5) are summed.
There is no weighting of individual items. A more complex scoring method, called
“item-response-theory”–based scoring, takes into account multiple levels of difficulty
for each item. A computer program is available from the World Health Organization
Web site. The authors of DSM-5, in part on the basis of the findings from field trials in
adult samples, recommend the calculation and use of average scores for each domain
(e.g., understanding and communication) and for general disability. These scores were
found to be reliable and clinically useful to the clinicians participating in the field trials.
The average domain score is calculated by dividing the raw domain score by the num-
ber of items in the domain. The average general disability score is calculated by divid-
ing the raw overall score by the number of items in the measure (i.e., 36). The measure
may be repeated at regular intervals to track change in the individual’s level of disabil-
ity over time. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant
and problematic areas for the individual that might warrant further assessment and in-
tervention.

Cultural Formulation Interview

The Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) consists of 16 questions clinicians can use
to obtain information about the impact of a patient’s culture on key aspects of care. In
the CFI, _culture_ refers primarily to the values, orientations, and assumptions that in-
dividuals derive from membership in diverse social groups (e.g., ethnic groups, the
military, faith communities), which may conform or differ from medical explanations.
The term _culture_ also refers to aspects of a person’s background that may affect his or
her perspective, such as ethnicity, race, language, or religion.
The CFI focuses on the patient’s perspectives on the problem, the role of others in
influencing the course of the problem, the impact of the patient’s cultural back-
ground, the patient’s help-seeking experiences, and current expectations about treat-
ment and other forms of care. The CFI follows a person-centered approach to cultural
assessment by asking the patient to address these topics on the basis of his or her own
views rather than inquiring about the views of the person’s cultural group(s) of ori-
gin. This is intended to avoid stereotyping, as individuals vary substantially in how
they combine and interpret cultural information and perspectives. Because the CFI
concerns the patient’s views, there are no right or wrong answers. The interview is avail-
able online at [http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.](http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.)
The CFI can be used at the beginning of an initial assessment interview with all
adult patients in all clinical settings, regardless of the patient’s background or that of
the clinician. Patients and clinicians who appear to share the same cultural back-
ground may in fact differ on a number of perspectives relevant to care. Alternatively,
individual questions may be used at any point in the interview, as necessary. During
later stages in care, the CFI may be particularly helpful when there is difficulty in
making a diagnostic judgment, owing to a significant difference in cultural, religious,
or socioeconomic background of clinician and patient; when there is uncertainty about
the match between culturally expressed symptoms and diagnostic criteria; when it is
difficult to make a dimensional judgment of severity; when patients and clinicians
disagree on the course of treatment; or in cases of limited engagement and adherence.
This interview process and the information it elicits are expected to enhance the cul-
tural validity of the diagnostic assessment, facilitate treatment planning, and promote
patient engagement and satisfaction.
The CFI emphasizes four main domains:

1. **Cultural Definition of the Problem:** The presenting issues that led to the current
    illness episode, cast within the patient’s worldview. In this section, the patient de-
    scribes the problem and focuses on its most troubling aspects. This information starts
    to address what is most at stake for the patient with respect to the current presen-
    tation, including nonmedical aspects.
2. **Cultural Perceptions of Cause, Context, and Support:** The patient’s explanations
    for the circumstances of illness, including the cause of the problem. The patient
    also clarifies factors that improve or worsen the problem, with particular attention
    to the role of family, friends, and cultural background. The clinician seeks to obtain
    a holistic picture of the patient in his or her social environment with emphasis on
    how cultural elements affect the presentation.


**444** DSM-5 Guidebook

3. **Cultural Factors Affecting Self-Coping and Past Help Seeking:** The strategies
    employed by the patient to improve the situation, including those that have been
    most and least helpful. The patient also identifies past barriers to care. This infor-
    mation helps clarify the patient’s perspective on the nature of the problem, his or
    her mental health treatment expectations as opposed to expectations regarding
    other forms of help, and current resources to address the situation.
4. **Cultural Factors Affecting Current Help Seeking:** The patient’s perception of the
    relationship with the clinician, current potential treatment barriers, and prefer-
    ences for care. In this section, the patient specifies how the clinician may facilitate
    current treatment and what may interfere with the clinical relationship. Treatment
    preferences are elicited that may be incorporated into the treatment plan.

Supplementary modules have been developed that expand each domain of the CFI
and may help guide clinicians who wish to probe these domains in greater depth. Sup-
plementary modules have also been developed for populations with unique needs,
such as children and adolescents, elderly patients, and immigrants and refugees.

Personality Disorder—Trait Specified

## The Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group developed a new

model for the assessment of personality disorders and traits that included both cate-
gorical diagnoses and dimensional approaches. Although the proposal was not ac-
cepted by the American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees for inclusion in
Section II, the board chose to include it in Section III (as the chapter “Alternative
DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders”). According to DSM-5, this approach “pre-
serve[s] continuity with current clinical practice, while also introducing a new ap-
proach that aims to address numerous shortcomings of the current approach to
personality disorders” (American Psychiatric Association 2013, p. 761).
The work group proposed a wholesale reformulation of the personality disorder
class. This involved the elimination of 4 of 10 personality disorders and the introduc-
tion of a hybrid assessment scheme combining categorical diagnosis with the optional
dimensional assessment of personality impairment and pathological traits. Work
group members were influenced by many factors and considered the time ripe for a
new approach to personality assessment. Among their many concerns: 1) the number
(10) of personality disorders, some of which were rarely used and poorly supported
by the literature; 2) diagnostic criteria that failed to tap important psychological di-
mensions in favor of behavioral traits; 3) frequent comorbidity that made it uncommon


**450** DSM-5 Guidebook

for a person to be diagnosed with a single personality disorder type; 4) polythetic cri-
teria (i.e., the “Chinese menu” approach) that contributed to the heterogeneity seen
with some disorders, such as borderline personality disorder, which requires at least
five of nine symptoms, leading to 151 ways to satisfy the criteria, with none required
(Sanislow et al. 2002); and, finally, 5) the fact that clinicians had little opportunity to
fully describe the extent of a person’s personality pathology because of the lack of di-
mensional approaches. The work group concluded that the two approaches were
complementary and offered advantages over the DSM-IV approach, and they devel-
oped a new model to address these concerns.
Their model came under critical fire from both clinicians and researchers almost
from the outset. Although critics generally acknowledged the value of dimensional
assessments, the proposed model was considered too complicated for busy clinicians,
many of whom—it was thought—would never have time to use it. Further, many
psychiatrists are unfamiliar with the personality domains and traits assessed (which
came largely from the field of academic psychology) and expressed discomfort with
the model. Many were concerned that use of the model for dimensionally rating per-
sonality domains and traits would be mandatory and not optional. Interestingly, the
use of dimensional ratings was considered during the development of DSM-III but
was rejected mainly because of the relative lack of familiarity that psychiatrists have
with such systems and the concern that the systems provide more information than
clinicians would use (Spitzer et al. 1980). The use of any new system involves a learn-
ing curve, and this was especially true when DSM-III was rolled out and required that
clinicians rethink their approach to assessment and diagnosis.
In the alternative model, categorical diagnosis has been preserved. The number of
personality disorders has been reduced from 10 to 6. It was thought that reducing the
number of diagnoses would help minimize the problem of frequent comorbidity. Be-
cause there have been very few empirical studies of the paranoid, schizoid, histrionic,
and dependent types, these disorders were thought appropriate for exclusion. Al-
though there had been some initial discussion about deleting narcissistic personality
disorder as well, the work group decided to retain it in their model (Ronningstam 2011).
The rationale for retaining the six disorders was based on evidence of disorder
prevalence, degree of psychosocial impairment, and other research supporting the
validity of the diagnoses. For example, the antisocial, borderline, and schizotypal types
have extensive evidence regarding validity and clinical usefulness. The narcissistic
type was retained largely on the basis of the substantial clinician interest in the disorder
despite its infrequent use.
The criteria for the six personality disorders were revised to make them uniform
and to ensure that they were based on a standard set of empirically tested personality
domains and traits. The criteria are not polythetic, in order to address concerns about
heterogeneity. Diagnosis of any of the six personality disorders requires that the indi-
vidual have impairments in personality functioning (Criterion A) and pathological
personality traits specific to the disorder (Criterion B). Although not part of the dis-
order-specific criteria (but part of the general personality disorder criteria), the indi-
vidual also must have impairment of functioning that is stable across time (Criterion D)
and consistent across situations (Criterion C), and the impairments must not be nor-


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **451**

mative for the person’s developmental stage or sociocultural environment (Criterion
G) and must not be due to a substance or another medical condition (Criterion F). For
individuals who do not fit within these diagnoses, the new category personality dis-
order—trait specified is used (replacing the DSM-IV category personality disorder
not otherwise specified).
Categorical diagnosis is combined with an optional dimensional assessment of
the individual’s level of personality impairment and pathological personality traits
(Krueger and Eaton 2010; Krueger et al. 2011). When impairments are present, the
Level of Personality Functioning Scale can be used to assess degree of disturbance in
self- and interpersonal functioning. Components of self-functioning involve identity
and self-direction, whereas components of interpersonal functioning involve empa-
thy and intimacy. Impairment is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (healthy
functioning) to 4 (poor functioning). Ratings can also be made for a broad range of
adaptive and maladaptive personality trait domains and facets, to identify the nature
and extent of personality pathology, information that may be helpful for treatment
planning. The personality domains and trait facets can be used to describe the person-
ality characteristics of any individual, even those without a personality disorder.
The work group drew on existing models of maladaptive personality traits and
reached consensus on the broad domains of personality that the new system should
encompass, influenced by McCrae and Costa’s (1987) five-factor model. The five do-
mains are negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoti-
cism. Each comprises a lower order of specific traits called _facets._ Trait facets are useful
for representing personality variation _within_ domains. For this reason, there are many
more facets (25) than domains (which compares to the 79 personality disorder criteria
in DSM-IV). One aim of the work group had been to condense this somewhat un-
wieldy number into a more manageable and reliable set of traits. Trait domains and
facets are rated on a 4-point dimensional scale, ranging from 0 (very little or not de-
scriptive at all) to 3 (extremely descriptive). Trait domains and their relevant trait fac-
ets are as follows:

- **Negative affectivity** (experiences negative emotions frequently and intensely):
    emotional lability, anxiousness, separation insecurity, perseveration, submissive-
    ness, hostility, depressivity, suspiciousness, (lack of) restricted affectivity
- **Detachment** (withdrawal from other people and from social interactions): re-
    stricted affectivity, depressivity, suspiciousness, withdrawal, anhedonia, intimacy
    avoidance
- **Antagonism** (engaging in behaviors that put the person at odds with other peo-
    ple): manipulativeness, deceitfulness, grandiosity, attention seeking, callousness,
    hostility
- **Disinhibition** (engaging in behaviors on impulse, without reflecting on potential
    future consequences): irresponsibility, impulsivity, distractibility, risk taking, (lack
    of) rigid perfectionism
- **Psychoticism** (unusual and bizarre experiences): unusual beliefs and experiences,
    eccentricity, cognitive and perceptual dysregulation


**452** DSM-5 Guidebook

The alternative model is designed to be flexible to suit the clinician’s needs and
interests. Clinicians can diagnose categorical personality disorders, diagnose person-
ality disorder—trait specified for individuals who do not meet one of the six specified
types, describe the heterogeneity at both the level of personality functioning and the
level of pathological traits within personality disorder types, or describe personality
trait profiles for all patients.

GENERAL CRITERIA FOR PERSONALITY DISORDER

A personality disorder diagnosis requires an assessment of level of personality im-
pairment in two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy
(Criterion A). The impairments must be “moderate or greater” as assessed with the
Level of Personality Functioning Scale (Table 21–1). Pathological personality traits
must be present that are disorder specific (Criterion B). The impairments in personal-
ity functioning and personality traits are relatively inflexible and pervasive across a
broad range of personal and social situations (Criterion C); relatively stable across
time, with onsets that can be traced back to at least adolescence or early adulthood
(Criterion D); not better accounted for by another mental disorder (Criterion E); not
attributable to the effects of a substance or of another medical condition (Criterion F);
and not better understood as normal for an individual’s developmental stage or so-
ciocultural environment (Criterion G).

General Criteria for Personality Disorder

The essential features of a personality disorder are

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality (self/interpersonal) functioning.
B. One or more pathological personality traits.
C. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual’s personality trait ex-
pression are relatively inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal
and social situations.
D. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual’s personality trait ex-
pression are relatively stable across time, with onsets that can be traced back to
at least adolescence or early adulthood.
E. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual’s personality trait ex-
pression are not better explained by another mental disorder.
F. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual’s personality trait ex-
pression are not solely attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or
another medical condition (e.g., severe head trauma).
G. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual’s personality trait ex-
pression are not better understood as normal for an individual’s developmental
stage or sociocultural environment.

All Section III personality disorders described by the criteria sets below also meet
the general definition.

**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **457**

SPECIFIC PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Section III includes diagnostic criteria for antisocial, avoidant, borderline, narcissistic,
obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal personality disorders. Each is defined by spe-
cific impairments in personality functioning (Criterion A) and characteristic patho-
logical personality traits (Criterion B).

Antisocial Personality Disorder

Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a failure to conform to lawful and
ethical behavior and/or an egocentric, callous lack of concern for others, accompa-
nied by deceitfulness, irresponsibility, manipulativeness, and/or risk taking.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Antisocial
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Egocentrism; self-esteem derived from personal gain, power, or plea-
    sure.
2. **Self-direction:** Goal setting based on personal gratification; absence of proso-
    cial internal standards, associated with failure to conform to lawful or culturally
    normative ethical behavior.
3. **Empathy:** Lack of concern for feelings, needs, or suffering of others; lack of re-
    morse after hurting or mistreating another.
4. **Intimacy:** Incapacity for mutually intimate relationships, as exploitation is a pri-
    mary means of relating to others, including by deceit and coercion; use of dom-
    inance or intimidation to control others.

B. Six or more of the following seven pathological personality traits:

1. **Manipulativeness** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Frequent use of subterfuge to
    influence or control others; use of seduction, charm, glibness, or ingratiation to
    achieve one’s ends.
2. **Callousness** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Lack of concern for feelings or prob-
    lems of others; lack of guilt or remorse about the negative or harmful effects of
    one’s actions on others; aggression; sadism.
3. **Deceitfulness** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Dishonesty and fraudulence; mis-
    representation of self; embellishment or fabrication when relating events.
4. **Hostility** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Persistent or frequent angry feelings; anger
    or irritability in response to minor slights and insults; mean, nasty, or vengeful be-
    havior.
5. **Risk taking** (an aspect of **Disinhibition** ): Engagement in dangerous, risky, and
    potentially self-damaging activities, unnecessarily and without regard for conse-
    quences; boredom proneness and thoughtless initiation of activities to counter


**458** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
boredom; lack of concern for one’s limitations and denial of the reality of personal
danger.
```
6. **Impulsivity** (an aspect of **Disinhibition** ): Acting on the spur of the moment in
    response to immediate stimuli; acting on a momentary basis without a plan or
    consideration of outcomes; difficulty establishing and following plans.
7. **Irresponsibility** (an aspect of **Disinhibition** ): Disregard for—and failure to
    honor—financial and other obligations or commitments; lack of respect for—
    and lack of follow-through on—agreements and promises.

**Note:** The individual is at least 18 years of age.

Specify if:
**With psychopathic features.**

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning
in two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. Individ-
uals with antisocial personality disorder may exhibit a notable egocentrism bordering
on grandiosity that may not be evident initially, and a concomitant sense of entitle-
ment and invulnerability (A1). Self-esteem may be disproportionately high, leading
to selfishness and overt or covert disregard for legal, moral, or cultural restrictions
(A2). These individuals may show a lack of concern for others’ feelings or needs or a
frank lack of remorse (A3). Sometimes a form of indifference or emotional detach-
ment emerges that is accompanied by the absence of empathy and inability to estab-
lish genuine intimacy (A4), although these characteristics may not be immediately
noticeable in everyday social transactions or during an initial assessment.

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of six or more of seven pathological personality traits.
These include manipulativeness (B1), which can manifest as the deliberate use of sub-
terfuge to control or influence others; callousness (B2), which can include lack of re-
morse or guilt and/or a lack of concern for the feelings of others; deceitfulness (B3),
manifested as dishonesty and fraudulence, as well as misrepresentation of self and also
embellishment and fabrication; hostility (B4), which includes persistent or frequent an-
gry feelings or vengeful behavior; risk taking (B5), which includes participating in risky
or dangerous behaviors; impulsivity (B6), which involves acting on the spur of the mo-
ment without regard for consequences; and irresponsibility (B7), which entails a disre-
gard for financial and other commitments.
The individual must be at least 18 years old. The specifier “with psychopathic fea-
tures” can be used to denote the presence of psychopathy, which describes a subset
of persons with antisocial personality disorder characterized by “a lack of anxiety or
fear and by a bold interpersonal style that may mask maladaptive behaviors” (Amer-
ican Psychiatric Association 2013, p. 765).


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **459**

Avoidant Personality Disorder

Typical features of avoidant personality disorder are the avoidance of social situa-
tions and inhibition in interpersonal relationships related to feelings of ineptitude
and inadequacy, anxious preoccupation with negative evaluation and rejection, and
fears of ridicule or embarrassment.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Avoidant
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Low self-esteem associated with self-appraisal as socially inept, per-
    sonally unappealing, or inferior; excessive feelings of shame.
2. **Self-direction:** Unrealistic standards for behavior associated with reluctance
    to pursue goals, take personal risks, or engage in new activities involving inter-
    personal contact.
3. **Empathy:** Preoccupation with, and sensitivity to, criticism or rejection, associ-
    ated with distorted inference of others’ perspectives as negative.
4. **Intimacy:** Reluctance to get involved with people unless being certain of being
    liked; diminished mutuality within intimate relationships because of fear of be-
    ing shamed or ridiculed.

B. Three or more of the following four pathological personality traits, one of which
must be (1) Anxiousness:

1. **Anxiousness** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Intense feelings of nervous-
    ness, tenseness, or panic, often in reaction to social situations; worry about the
    negative effects of past unpleasant experiences and future negative possibili-
    ties; feeling fearful, apprehensive, or threatened by uncertainty; fears of embar-
    rassment.
2. **Withdrawal** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Reticence in social situations; avoid-
    ance of social contacts and activity; lack of initiation of social contact.
3. **Anhedonia** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Lack of enjoyment from, engagement
    in, or energy for life’s experiences; deficits in the capacity to feel pleasure or
    take interest in things.
4. **Intimacy avoidance** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Avoidance of close or romantic
    relationships, interpersonal attachments, and intimate sexual relationships.

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning in
two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. Individuals
with avoidant personality disorder may have low self-esteem and see themselves as so-
cially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior and sometimes have excessive feelings
of shame or inadequacy (A1). These individuals may be averse to taking personal risk


**460** DSM-5 Guidebook

or engaging in new activities that involve interpersonal contact. This can lead them to
avoid engaging in anything new or challenging that is outside their comfort zone (A2).
They may be so preoccupied with the potential for negative social evaluation that they
find it difficult to empathize with the actual feelings or perspectives of others (A3). These
individuals may avoid even casual involvement with others and rarely develop close
personal relationships because of their conviction that anyone who came to know them
well would recognize their inadequacy and reject them (A4).

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of three or more of four items. Individuals with avoid-
ant personality disorder are often very anxious in social situations and worry about
the negative effects of past unpleasant experiences (B1). This may lead them to avoid
social situations or other activities that involve dealing with others. They may prefer
to spend time alone rather than with others, and may prefer to maintain emotional
distance from others and have minimal engagement with others when social contact
is necessary (B2). Avoidance extends to positive emotions as well. Individuals with
avoidant personality disorder may lack interest in and claim not to derive pleasure
from activities that most people do. They may see themselves as unenergetic and unen-
thusiastic, and they may acknowledge that they do not try to live full lives and do not
enjoy their day-to-day activities or even life itself (B3). Intimate relationships in par-
ticular are avoided. Such people may disavow interest in romantic attachments and
sexual relationships and often distance themselves from any relationship that begins
to get close (B4).

Borderline Personality Disorder

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by instability of self-image, personal
goals, interpersonal relationships, and affects, accompanied by impulsivity, risk-taking,
and/or hostility.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Borderline
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Markedly impoverished, poorly developed, or unstable self-image, of-
    ten associated with excessive self-criticism; chronic feelings of emptiness; dis-
    sociative states under stress.
2. **Self-direction:** Instability in goals, aspirations, values, or career plans.
3. **Empathy:** Compromised ability to recognize the feelings and needs of others as-
    sociated with interpersonal hypersensitivity (i.e., prone to feel slighted or in-
    sulted); perceptions of others selectively biased toward negative attributes or
    vulnerabilities.


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **461**

4. **Intimacy:** Intense, unstable, and conflicted close relationships, marked by mis-
    trust, neediness, and anxious preoccupation with real or imagined abandon-
    ment; close relationships often viewed in extremes of idealization and
    devaluation and alternating between overinvolvement and withdrawal.

B. Four or more of the following seven pathological personality traits, at least one of
which must be (5) Impulsivity, (6) Risk taking, or (7) Hostility:

1. **Emotional lability** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Unstable emotional ex-
    periences and frequent mood changes; emotions that are easily aroused, in-
    tense, and/or out of proportion to events and circumstances.
2. **Anxiousness** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Intense feelings of nervous-
    ness, tenseness, or panic, often in reaction to interpersonal stresses; worry
    about the negative effects of past unpleasant experiences and future negative
    possibilities; feeling fearful, apprehensive, or threatened by uncertainty; fears
    of falling apart or losing control.
3. **Separation insecurity** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Fears of rejection
    by—and/or separation from—significant others, associated with fears of exces-
    sive dependency and complete loss of autonomy.
4. **Depressivity** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Frequent feelings of being
    down, miserable, and/or hopeless; difficulty recovering from such moods;
    pessimism about the future; pervasive shame; feelings of inferior self-worth;
    thoughts of suicide and suicidal behavior.
5. **Impulsivity** (an aspect of **Disinhibition** ): Acting on the spur of the moment in
    response to immediate stimuli; acting on a momentary basis without a plan or
    consideration of outcomes; difficulty establishing or following plans; a sense of
    urgency and self-harming behavior under emotional distress.
6. **Risk taking** (an aspect of **Disinhibition** ): Engagement in dangerous, risky,
    and potentially self-damaging activities, unnecessarily and without regard to
    consequences; lack of concern for one’s limitations and denial of the reality of
    personal danger.
7. **Hostility** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Persistent or frequent angry feelings; an-
    ger or irritability in response to minor slights and insults.

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning
in two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. Individ-
uals with borderline personality disorder may have a markedly unstable and often
negative self-image (Criterion A1), with dramatic shifts in self-direction, including
goals, values, and aspirations (A2). These individuals are often interpersonally hy-
persensitive and have difficulty trusting others, yet they have an intolerance of being
alone. They may appear to have empathy for others, but the apparent empathy may
quickly evaporate if they feel their own needs are not being met (A3). Interpersonal re-
lationships are often unstable and intense. This may lead these individuals to overide-
alize romantic partners on the first or second meeting, leading to demands to spend
a lot of time together and to share the most intimate details of their own lives very
early in a relationship (A4).


**462** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of four or more of seven items, at least one of which
must be impulsivity, risk taking, or hostility. Individuals with borderline personality dis-
order may experience a marked affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood
that is out of proportion to actual events or circumstances (B1). These individuals may
experience intense feelings of anxiety, often in response to personal stresses (B2). They
often experience intense fears of rejection by or separation from significant others that
may be associated with significant despondency (B3). Dysphoric mood is common,
with frequent feelings of despair and hopelessness that may lead to suicidal thoughts
or behaviors (B4). Recurrent suicidality may be the reason these individuals seek help.
Individuals with this disorder are often impulsive, acting on the spur of the moment,
often in response to immediate stimuli (B5). This can lead them to abuse substances,
engage in unsafe sex, drive dangerously, or engage in other risky behaviors (B6). They
have difficulty controlling their anger and may display extreme sarcasm, bitterness,
or verbal outbursts, even in response to minor slights or insults (B7).

Narcissistic Personality Disorder

Narcissistic personality disorder is typically characterized by variable and vulnerable
self-esteem, with attempts at regulation through attention seeking and approval seek-
ing and either overt or covert grandiosity.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Narcissistic
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Excessive reference to others for self-definition and self-esteem reg-
    ulation; exaggerated self-appraisal inflated or deflated, or vacillating between
    extremes; emotional regulation mirrors fluctuations in self-esteem.
2. **Self-direction:** Goal setting based on gaining approval from others; personal
    standards unreasonably high in order to see oneself as exceptional, or too low
    based on a sense of entitlement; often unaware of own motivations.
3. **Empathy:** Impaired ability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs
    of others; excessively attuned to reactions of others, but only if perceived as
    relevant to self; over- or underestimation of own effect on others.
4. **Intimacy:** Relationships largely superficial and exist to serve self-esteem reg-
    ulation; mutuality constrained by little genuine interest in others’ experiences and
    predominance of a need for personal gain.

B. Both of the following pathological personality traits:

1. **Grandiosity** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Feelings of entitlement, either overt
    or covert; self-centeredness; firmly holding to the belief that one is better than
    others; condescension toward others.


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **463**

2. **Attention seeking** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Excessive attempts to attract
    and be the focus of the attention of others; admiration seeking.

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning in
two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. There may be a
pervasive sense of exaggerated self-importance and appraisal (A1). Individuals with this
disorder may exhibit a sense of entitlement (A2) and have little ability to recognize the
feelings of others (A3). Relationships may seem very superficial and self-serving (A4).

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of two pathological personality traits: grandiosity and
attention seeking. A core characteristic of individuals with narcissistic personality disor-
der is the regulation of self-esteem by resorting to grandiose strategies of overcompen-
sation, which may include feelings of entitlement, self-centeredness, and the belief that
one is better than others (B1). These individuals display an overreliance on seeking at-
tention and admiration from others or seeking to be the focus of attention by others (B2).

Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is typically characterized by difficulties
in establishing and sustaining close relationships, associated with a rigid perfection-
ism, inflexibility, and restricted emotional expression.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Sense of self derived predominantly from work or productivity; con-
    stricted experience and expression of strong emotions.
2. **Self-direction:** Difficulty completing tasks and realizing goals, associated with
    rigid and unreasonably high and inflexible internal standards of behavior;
    overly conscientious and moralistic attitudes.
3. **Empathy:** Difficulty understanding and appreciating the ideas, feelings, or be-
    haviors of others.
4. **Intimacy:** Relationships seen as secondary to work and productivity; rigidity
    and stubbornness negatively affect relationships with others.

B. Three or more of the following four pathological personality traits, one of which
must be (1) Rigid perfectionism:

1. **Rigid perfectionism** (an aspect of extreme Conscientiousness [the opposite
    pole of Detachment]): Rigid insistence on everything being flawless, perfect,


**464** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
and without errors or faults, including one’s own and others’ performance; sac-
rificing of timeliness to ensure correctness in every detail; believing that there
is only one right way to do things; difficulty changing ideas and/or viewpoint;
preoccupation with details, organization, and order.
```
2. **Perseveration** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Persistence at tasks long
    after the behavior has ceased to be functional or effective; continuance of the
    same behavior despite repeated failures.
3. **Intimacy avoidance** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Avoidance of close or ro-
    mantic relationships, interpersonal attachments, and intimate sexual relation-
    ships.
4. **Restricted affectivity** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Little reaction to emotion-
    ally arousing situations; constricted emotional experience and expression; in-
    difference or coldness.

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning
in two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. Individ-
uals with this disorder may have an excessive devotion to work or productivity, with
constricted expression of emotions (A1). These individuals may attempt to maintain
a sense of control through a rigid preoccupation with order and detail, to the extent
that the major goal of attempted activities is often not achieved (A2). They may have
difficulty understanding and appreciating the feelings of others (A3). These traits
may lead these individuals to value work and productivity over personal relationships,
which are viewed as of secondary importance (A4).

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of three or more of four items, one of which must be
rigid perfectionism. The individual may be overly focused on achieving perfection,
often believing that there is only one right way to do things (B1). Activities are often
overly methodical because the individual is overly concerned with time, punctuality,
schedules, and rules. The individual may persist at tasks despite repeated failures,
even when a behavior has ceased to be functional or effective (B2). The rigid approach
to tasks, problems, and people results in limited capacity to adapt to changing de-
mands or circumstances. The need to complete tasks perfectly may result in a paralysis
of indecision, such that important tasks may never be completed. These individuals
lack appreciation of the impact of their own behaviors on the thoughts and emotions
of other people, which may contribute to their avoidance or lack of romantic relation-
ships, friendships, or even sexual intimacy (B3, B4).

Schizotypal Personality Disorder

Schizotypal personality disorder is typically characterized by impairments in the ca-
pacity for social and close relationships and eccentricities in cognition, perception,


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **465**

and behavior that are associated with distorted self-image and incoherent personal
goals and accompanied by suspiciousness and restricted emotional expression.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Schizotypal
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Confused boundaries between self and others; distorted self-concept;
    emotional expression often not congruent with context or internal experience.
2. **Self-direction:** Unrealistic or incoherent goals; no clear set of internal stan-
    dards.
3. **Empathy:** Pronounced difficulty understanding impact of own behaviors on
    others; frequent misinterpretations of others’ motivations and behaviors.
4. **Intimacy:** Marked impairments in developing close relationships, associated
    with mistrust and anxiety.

B. Four or more of the following six pathological personality traits:

1. **Cognitive and perceptual dysregulation** (an aspect of **Psychoticism** ): Odd
    or unusual thought processes; vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, over-
    elaborate, or stereotyped thought or speech; odd sensations in various sensory
    modalities.
2. **Unusual beliefs and experiences** (an aspect of **Psychoticism** ): Thought con-
    tent and views of reality that are viewed by others as bizarre or idiosyncratic;
    unusual experiences of reality.
3. **Eccentricity** (an aspect of **Psychoticism** ): Odd, unusual, or bizarre behavior
    or appearance; saying unusual or inappropriate things.
4. **Restricted affectivity** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Little reaction to emotion-
    ally arousing situations; constricted emotional experience and expression; in-
    difference or coldness.
5. **Withdrawal** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Preference for being alone to being
    with others; reticence in social situations; avoidance of social contacts and ac-
    tivity; lack of initiation of social contact.
6. **Suspiciousness** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Expectations of—and height-
    ened sensitivity to—signs of interpersonal ill-intent or harm; doubts about loy-
    alty and fidelity of others; feelings of persecution.

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning
in two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. Individ-
uals with schizotypal personality disorder may have confused boundaries between
self and others, distorted self-concept, and emotional expression that is not congruent
with context or internal experience (A1). Impairments in self-direction include unre-
alistic or incoherent goals and having no clear set of internal standards (A2). Problems


**466** DSM-5 Guidebook

with empathy may include pronounced difficulty understanding the impact of their
own behaviors on others and misinterpretations of others’ motivations and behaviors
(A3). Problems with intimacy may include marked impairments in developing close
relationships, associated with mistrust and anxiety (A4).

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of four or more of six items. Individuals with schizo-
typal personality disorder often have pronounced pathological personality traits in
the area of psychoticism because they are prone to psychotic-like experiences such as
having unusual thought processes or magical beliefs or they may display vague or di-
gressive speech (B1, B2). These individuals are considered by others to be odd or eccen-
tric, and they may display bizarre behaviors or make odd statements (B3). Restricted
affectivity can be of concern, and the individual may have little reaction to emotion-
ally stimulating events (B4). Social withdrawal is common; the individual displays
reticence in social situations or simply prefers to be alone (B5). Suspiciousness is com-
monly experienced. The individual may be hypervigilant and suspect others as hav-
ing negative or harmful intentions toward him or her (B6).

Personality Disorder—Trait Specified

Personality disorder—trait specified replaces the DSM-IV diagnosis personality dis-
order not otherwise specified. This is a residual category for persons with personality
disorders that do not meet criteria for one of the specific disorders. Rather than leav-
ing the nature of the personality disorder unspecified, the clinician can specify the in-
dividual’s personality disorder. Both the personality domain and trait facet levels
allow a detailed assessment of the individual’s personality features. For example, two
people may be similar because they both have extreme disinhibition, but they may
differ in that only one of them also manifests psychoticism with unusual beliefs and
experiences.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Personality Disorder—
Trait Specified

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by difficul-
ties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity**
2. **Self-direction**
3. **Empathy**
4. **Intimacy**

B. One or more pathological personality trait domains OR specific trait facets within
domains, considering ALL of the following domains:

1. **Negative Affectivity** (vs. Emotional Stability): Frequent and intense experi-
    ences of high levels of a wide range of negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, de-


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **467**

```
pression, guilt/shame, worry, anger), and their behavioral (e.g., self-harm) and
interpersonal (e.g., dependency) manifestations.
```
2. **Detachment** (vs. Extraversion): Avoidance of socioemotional experience, in-
    cluding both withdrawal from interpersonal interactions, ranging from casual,
    daily interactions to friendships to intimate relationships, as well as restricted
    affective experience and expression, particularly limited hedonic capacity.
3. **Antagonism** (vs. Agreeableness): Behaviors that put the individual at odds
    with other people, including an exaggerated sense of self-importance and a
    concomitant expectation of special treatment, as well as a callous antipathy to-
    ward others, encompassing both unawareness of others’ needs and feelings,
    and a readiness to use others in the service of self-enhancement.
4. **Disinhibition** (vs. Conscientiousness): Orientation toward immediate gratifi-
    cation, leading to impulsive behavior driven by current thoughts, feelings, and
    external stimuli, without regard for past learning or consideration of future con-
    sequences.
5. **Psychoticism** (vs. Lucidity): Exhibiting a wide range of culturally incongruent
    odd, eccentric, or unusual behaviors and cognitions, including both process
    (e.g., perception, dissociation) and content (e.g., beliefs).

Criteria A and B

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in two or more of four ar-
eas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy (Criterion A). The clinician should
endorse one or more of five pathological trait domains or specific trait facets within
domains (Criterion B). This approach allows the clinician to take a broad perspective
and record the person’s prominent maladaptive personality features. He or she can
simply record which of the five personality trait domains characterize an individual,
or choose to specify more detailed features and record which of the trait facets (within
the domains) are most characteristic. The decision to use this category depends on the
needs of the clinical situation.

## Conditions for

###### 469

Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome
Depressive Episodes With Short-Duration Hypomania
Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder
Caffeine Use Disorder
Internet Gaming Disorder
Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure
Suicidal Behavior Disorder
Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

## Section III of DSM-5 includes eight proposed disorders that may

be included in future DSM editions (Table 22–1). In this section, the DSM-5 authors
provide an opportunity for establishing standardized criteria to facilitate research that
might indicate whether a disorder should eventually be included as an official diag-
nosis. Inclusion of these criteria sets is “intended to provide a common language for
researchers and clinicians who are interested in studying these disorders” (American
Psychiatric Association 2013, p. 783). It is hoped that this will stimulate research that
may allow the field to better understand these conditions and inform decisions about
their placement in future DSM editions.
Placing provisional disorders in the manual began with DSM-III-R, which in-
cluded Appendix A, “Proposed Diagnostic Categories Needing Further Study.”
Three criteria sets were included: late luteal phase dysphoric disorder, sadistic per-
sonality disorder, and self-defeating personality disorder. Of these three, only late
luteal phase dysphoric disorder has gained the requisite recognition and research
support. It is included (with modification) in DSM-5 as premenstrual dysphoric dis-
order.
DSM-IV included 26 criteria sets, revised criteria, and axes in a much expanded
Appendix B (“Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study”). Each had been
recommended for inclusion in DSM-IV, but the task force concluded that insufficient

data existed to warrant their inclusion as official categories or axes. These included
proposed diagnoses (e.g., postconcussional disorder, dissociative trance disorder),
criteria (e.g., alternative Criterion B for dysthymic disorder), and axes (Defensive
Functioning Scale).
Of the conditions included in DSM-IV Appendix B, several have become stand-
alone diagnoses in DSM-5, a fact that demonstrates the utility of providing criteria to
stimulate research. Postconcussional disorder and mild neurocognitive disorder are
included in DSM-5, although the former has been reformulated as neurocognitive
disorder due to traumatic brain injury. Caffeine withdrawal, premenstrual dysphoric
disorder, factitious disorder by proxy (now factitious disorder imposed on another),
and binge-eating disorder are also included, in each instance with edits to their re-
spective criteria. On the other hand, several proposed disorders did not make the cut:
postpsychotic depressive disorder of schizophrenia, simple deteriorative disorder
(simple schizophrenia), minor depressive disorder, recurrent brief depressive disor-
der, mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, dissociative trance disorder, depressive per-
sonality disorder, and passive-aggressive personality disorder (negativistic personal-
ity disorder).

Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome

The Psychotic Disorders Work Group proposed the new diagnosis attenuated psy-
chosis syndrome. The rationale is to identify persons at risk for schizophrenia in order
to facilitate early identification and treatment to improve outcomes. The syndrome
consists of mild psychotic-like symptoms and clinically relevant distress and impair-
ment. Conversion to schizophrenia or some other full-blown psychosis is a possible
outcome and occurs in a significant minority of individuals. Because the syndrome is
most often seen as a comorbid disorder, it is not clear whether it represents a distinct
disorder or rather a trait or state vulnerability for increased risk of development of a
psychotic disorder. Another concern is that it appears to overlap with schizotypal per-
sonality disorder, and it is not clear how the conditions relate.
The proposed diagnosis became a focus of controversy during the development
of DSM-5. Critics within and outside the field expressed concern that the diagnosis


**_Conditions for Further Study_** **471**

would result in psychiatric labeling of persons who are not ill and who in most cases
would never develop a psychotic disorder, and would lead to unnecessary and costly
interventions. This could include the increased use of off-label antipsychotics, putting
patients at risk for iatrogenic complications (e.g., weight gain, metabolic disorders,
movement disorders).

Proposed Criteria for Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome

A. At least one of the following symptoms is present in attenuated form, with relatively
intact reality testing, and is of sufficient severity or frequency to warrant clinical at-
tention:

1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
3. Disorganized speech.

B. Symptom(s) must have been present at least once per week for the past month.
C. Symptom(s) must have begun or worsened in the past year.
D. Symptom(s) is sufficiently distressing and disabling to the individual to warrant
clinical attention.
E. Symptom(s) is not better explained by another mental disorder, including a de-
pressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, and is not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.
F. Criteria for any psychotic disorder have never been met.

Depressive Episodes With

Short-Duration Hypomania

Individuals with short-duration hypomania have experienced at least one major de-
pressive episode as well as at least two episodes of 2–3 days’ duration in which crite-
ria for a hypomanic episode were met except for symptom duration. The symptoms
represent a noticeable change in the individual’s normal behavior.
The Mood Disorders Work Group proposed the diagnosis to recognize that people
who have experienced short-duration hypomania and a major depressive episode,
with their increased comorbidity with substance use disorders and greater history of
bipolar disorder, more closely resembles individuals with bipolar disorder that those
with major depressive disorder. It is estimated that 2.8% of the general population ex-
perience short-duration hypomania, and the prevalence seems greater in women.
While the proposed criteria would fill a diagnostic gap for those with short-dura-
tion hypomania, the diagnosis could lead to confusion with bipolar II disorder, major
depressive disorder with mixed features, or cyclothymic disorder. The condition could
also be confused with borderline personality disorder, in which affective instability is
a common symptom.


**472** DSM-5 Guidebook

Proposed Criteria for Depressive Episodes With
Short-Duration Hypomania

**Lifetime experience of at least one major depressive episode meeting the fol-
lowing criteria:**
A. Five (or more) of the following criteria have been present during the same 2-week
period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symp-
toms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. ( **Note:** Do not
include symptoms that are clearly attributable to a medical condition.)

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either sub-
    jective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by oth-
    ers (e.g., appears tearful). ( **Note:** In children and adolescents, can be irritable
    mood.)
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of
the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or obser-
vation).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more
than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly
every day. ( **Note:** In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others,
not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be
delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being
sick).
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day
(either by subjective account or as observed by others).
9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation
    without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing
    suicide.

B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or
another medical condition.
D. The disturbance is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder and is not su-
perimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder,
or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic dis-
order.

**At least two lifetime episodes of hypomanic periods that involve the required
criterion symptoms below but are of insufficient duration (at least 2 days but less
than 4 consecutive days) to meet criteria for a hypomanic episode. The criterion
symptoms are as follows:**
A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable
mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy.


**_Conditions for Further Study_** **473**

B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or
more) of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable), rep-
resent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a signifi-
cant degree:

1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressured to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant exter-
    nal stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)
    or psychomotor agitation.
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-
    quences (e.g., the individual engages in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual in-
    discretions, or foolish business investments).

C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is un-
characteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.
D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.
E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occu-
pational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic fea-
tures, the episode is, by definition, manic.
F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).

Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder

The Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum, Posttraumatic, and Dissociative Dis-
orders Work Group proposed persistent complex bereavement disorder as a new di-
agnosis on the basis of research showing that people who experience “prolonged” or
“complicated” grief after loss of a close family member or friend have significant dis-
tress or functional impairment compared with persons who experience normal grief
reactions. The work group believes that such conditions are not adequately covered
in DSM.

Proposed Criteria for Persistent Complex
Bereavement Disorder

A. The individual experienced the death of someone with whom he or she had a close
relationship.
B. Since the death, at least one of the following symptoms is experienced on more
days than not and to a clinically significant degree and has persisted for at least
12 months after the death in the case of bereaved adults and 6 months for bereaved
children:


**474** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. Persistent yearning/longing for the deceased. In young children, yearning may
    be expressed in play and behavior, including behaviors that reflect being sep-
    arated from, and also reuniting with, a caregiver or other attachment figure.
2. Intense sorrow and emotional pain in response to the death.
3. Preoccupation with the deceased.
4. Preoccupation with the circumstances of the death. In children, this preoccu-
    pation with the deceased may be expressed through the themes of play and
    behavior and may extend to preoccupation with possible death of others close
    to them.

C. Since the death, at least six of the following symptoms are experienced on more
days than not and to a clinically significant degree, and have persisted for at least
12 months after the death in the case of bereaved adults and 6 months for be-
reaved children:
**Reactive distress to the death**

1. Marked difficulty accepting the death. In children, this is dependent on the
    child’s capacity to comprehend the meaning and permanence of death.
2. Experiencing disbelief or emotional numbness over the loss.
3. Difficulty with positive reminiscing about the deceased.
4. Bitterness or anger related to the loss.
5. Maladaptive appraisals about oneself in relation to the deceased or the death
    (e.g., self-blame).
6. Excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss (e.g., avoidance of individuals,
    places, or situations associated with the deceased; in children, this may include
    avoidance of thoughts and feelings regarding the deceased).
**Social/identity disruption**
7. A desire to die in order to be with the deceased.
8. Difficulty trusting other individuals since the death.
9. Feeling alone or detached from other individuals since the death.
10. Feeling that life is meaningless or empty without the deceased, or the belief that
one cannot function without the deceased.
11. Confusion about one’s role in life, or a diminished sense of one’s identity (e.g.,
feeling that a part of oneself died with the deceased).
12. Difficulty or reluctance to pursue interests since the loss or to plan for the future
(e.g., friendships, activities).

D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
E. The bereavement reaction is out of proportion to or inconsistent with cultural, reli-
gious, or age-appropriate norms.

Specify if:
**With traumatic bereavement:** Bereavement due to homicide or suicide with per-
sistent distressing preoccupations regarding the traumatic nature of the death (of-
ten in response to loss reminders), including the deceased’s last moments, degree
of suffering and mutilating injury, or the malicious or intentional nature of the death.

Caffeine Use Disorder

The Substance-Related Disorders Work Group proposed inclusion of caffeine use dis-
order. Data show that a substantial proportion of chronic caffeine users develop fea-
tures of substance dependence: continued use despite physical or psychological
harm, unsuccessful efforts to cut down or quit, and continued use to avoid withdrawal
symptoms. Establishing a caffeine use disorder diagnosis would increase recognition
of the syndrome among health care providers and the general population. Recogni-
tion could lead to the development of specific cessation strategies and interventions
that could benefit a large number of individuals. On the other hand, critics suggest
that recognizing this disorder might trivialize substance use disorders in general be-
cause its prevalence would potentially include a large proportion of the adult general
population.

Proposed Criteria for Caffeine Use Disorder

A problematic pattern of caffeine use leading to clinically significant impairment or dis-
tress, as manifested by at least the first three of the following criteria occurring within a
12-month period:

1. A persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control caffeine use.
2. Continued caffeine use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
    physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacer-
    bated by caffeine.
3. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:

```
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for caffeine.
b. Caffeine (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal
symptoms.
```
4. Caffeine is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was in-
    tended.
5. Recurrent caffeine use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,
    school, or home (e.g., repeated tardiness or absences from work or school related
    to caffeine use or withdrawal).
6. Continued caffeine use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-
    sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of caffeine (e.g., arguments
    with spouse about consequences of use, medical problems, cost).
7. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:

```
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of caffeine to achieve desired effect.
b. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of caffeine.
```
8. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain caffeine, use caffeine,
    or recover from its effects.
9. Craving or a strong desire or urge to use caffeine.

Internet Gaming Disorder

Criteria were proposed by the Substance-Related Disorders Work Group to recognize a
new and rapidly expanding condition made possible by modern technology. Internet
gaming disorder consists of excessive and/or inappropriate use of the Internet to engage
in games, often with other players. Although this condition is relatively common, with
many reports from Asian countries, work group members argued that it is not adequately
represented DSM. Internet gaming disorder is possible only in societies where computers
are available and the Internet is accessible. For this reason, it shows the clear influence of
cultural and technological change on socially sanctioned behavior taken to its extreme.
Despite its newness, the disorder captures the same common clinical features that link it
to the substance addictions: repetitive and driven behaviors despite negative conse-
quences, diminished control over the behaviors, cravings for the behavior, and experienc-
ing a pleasurable response while engaged in the behavior. Symptoms of tolerance and
withdrawal, similar to those seen with substance use disorders, have also been reported.
Discussion regarding including this syndrome during the development of DSM-5
sparked debate among professionals and the lay public. Some believe that its inclu-
sion would medicalize bad behavior and potentially lead to including other so-called
behavioral addictions in future editions of DSM (e.g., compulsive shopping, overeat-
ing, hypersexual behavior). Others suggest that the concept is overly narrow, and a
broader category of “Internet addiction” or “compulsive computer use” should have
been proposed.

Proposed Criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder

Persistent and recurrent use of the Internet to engage in games, often with other play-
ers, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as indicated by five (or
more) of the following in a 12-month period:

1. Preoccupation with Internet games. (The individual thinks about previous gaming
    activity or anticipates playing the next game; Internet gaming becomes the domi-
    nant activity in daily life).
    **Note:** This disorder is distinct from Internet gambling, which is included under
    gambling disorder.
2. Withdrawal symptoms when Internet gaming is taken away. (These symptoms are
    typically described as irritability, anxiety, or sadness, but there are no physical
    signs of pharmacological withdrawal.)
3. Tolerance—the need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in Internet
    games.
4. Unsuccessful attempts to control the participation in Internet games.
5. Loss of interests in previous hobbies and entertainment as a result of, and with the
    exception of, Internet games.
6. Continued excessive use of Internet games despite knowledge of psychosocial prob-
    lems.
7. Has deceived family members, therapists, or others regarding the amount of Inter-
    net gaming.


**_Conditions for Further Study_** **477**

8. Use of Internet games to escape or relieve a negative mood (e.g., feelings of help-
    lessness, guilt, anxiety).
9. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career op-
    portunity because of participation in Internet games.

**Note:** Only nongambling Internet games are included in this disorder. Use of the In-
ternet for required activities in a business or profession is not included; nor is the dis-
order intended to include other recreational or social Internet use. Similarly, sexual
Internet sites are excluded.

Specify current severity:
Internet gaming disorder can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on the degree
of disruption of normal activities. Individuals with less severe Internet gaming disorder
may exhibit fewer symptoms and less disruption of their lives. Those with severe Inter-
net gaming disorder will have more hours spent on the computer and more severe loss
of relationships or career or school opportunities.

Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated With

Prenatal Alcohol Exposure

The Substance-Related Disorders Work Group proposed criteria for neurobehavioral
disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure to encompass a full range of de-
velopmental disabilities associated with in utero exposure to alcohol. The proposed
condition is a behavioral and psychological syndrome that creates clinically signifi-
cant distress and impairment.
The rationale for including this condition is to boost the recognition of persons nega-
tively impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure and to facilitate treatment referral. These in-
dividuals are overrepresented, although generally unrecognized, in the child welfare
system, juvenile detention and correctional facilities, and both outpatient and inpatient
psychiatric settings. Including this condition in DSM could boost recognition and referral
for appropriate care by mental health, educational, and criminal justice systems. On the
downside, some would argue that its symptoms are adequately captured in DSM and
that clinicians simply need to be alert to the symptoms. Another concern is that the diag-
nosis presumes a causal association with alcohol, which is difficult to prove. The symp-
toms are wide ranging and overlap with those of many disorders—including conduct
disorder and antisocial personality disorder—that are not specifically excluded.

Proposed Criteria for Neurobehavioral Disorder
Associated With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure

A. More than minimal exposure to alcohol during gestation, including prior to preg-
nancy recognition. Confirmation of gestational exposure to alcohol may be ob-
tained from maternal self-report of alcohol use in pregnancy, medical or other
records, or clinical observation.
B. Impaired neurocognitive functioning as manifested by one or more of the following:


**478** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. Impairment in global intellectual performance (i.e., IQ of 70 or below, or a stan-
    dard score of 70 or below on a comprehensive developmental assessment).
2. Impairment in executive functioning (e.g., poor planning and organization; in-
    flexibility; difficulty with behavioral inhibition).
3. Impairment in learning (e.g., lower academic achievement than expected for in-
    tellectual level; specific learning disability).
4. Memory impairment (e.g., problems remembering information learned re-
    cently; repeatedly making the same mistakes; difficulty remembering lengthy
    verbal instructions).
5. Impairment in visual-spatial reasoning (e.g., disorganized or poorly planned
    drawings or constructions; problems differentiating left from right).

C. Impaired self-regulation as manifested by one or more of the following:

1. Impairment in mood or behavioral regulation (e.g., mood lability; negative affect
    or irritability; frequent behavioral outbursts).
2. Attention deficit (e.g., difficulty shifting attention; difficulty sustaining mental effort).
3. Impairment in impulse control (e.g., difficulty waiting turn; difficulty complying
    with rules).

D. Impairment in adaptive functioning as manifested by two or more of the following,
one of which must be (1) or (2):

1. Communication deficit (e.g., delayed acquisition of language; difficulty under-
    standing spoken language).
2. Impairment in social communication and interaction (e.g., overly friendly with
    strangers; difficulty reading social cues; difficulty understanding social conse-
    quences).
3. Impairment in daily living skills (e.g., delayed toileting, feeding, or bathing; dif-
    ficulty managing daily schedule).
4. Impairment in motor skills (e.g., poor fine motor development; delayed attain-
    ment of gross motor milestones or ongoing deficits in gross motor function; def-
    icits in coordination and balance).

E. Onset of the disorder (symptoms in Criteria B, C, and D) occurs in childhood.
F. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, aca-
demic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
G. The disorder is not better explained by the direct physiological effects associated
with postnatal use of a substance (e.g., a medication, alcohol or other drugs), a
general medical condition (e.g., traumatic brain injury, delirium, dementia), another
known teratogen (e.g., fetal hydantoin syndrome), a genetic condition (e.g., Wil-
liams syndrome, Down syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome), or environmental
neglect.

Suicidal Behavior Disorder

The rationale supporting the inclusion of suicidal behavior disorder, offered by the
Mood Disorders Work Group, has mainly to do with coding. Although suicidal be-
havior causes significant morbidity and leads to high utilization of mental health re-
sources, DSM codes reflecting suicidal behavior are limited to E (external cause of


**_Conditions for Further Study_** **479**

injury) codes drawn from ICD-9-CM (E950–E959) that differentiate between acciden-
tal and self-inflicted injury. The codes are often assigned by administrative personnel
and are frequently ignored. Although suicidal behavior and ideation are listed as
symptoms of major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, these
symptoms are not codable and misrepresent the independent associations that these
behaviors have with many other psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, research sug-
gests that suicidal behaviors share similar pathological features, regardless of comor-
bidity. Thus, the absence of an approved code leads to incomplete and misleading
information in clinical records, and the availability of a codable condition might help
with prevention and safety monitoring efforts.

Proposed Criteria for Suicidal Behavior Disorder

A. Within the last 24 months, the individual has made a suicide attempt.
**Note:** A suicide attempt is a self-initiated sequence of behaviors by an individual
who, at the time of initiation, expected that the set of actions would lead to his or
her own death. (The “time of initiation” is the time when a behavior took place that
involved applying the method.)
B. The act does not meet criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury—that is, it does not in-
volve self-injury directed to the surface of the body undertaken to induce relief from
a negative feeling/cognitive state or to achieve a positive mood state.
C. The diagnosis is not applied to suicidal ideation or to preparatory acts.
D. The act was not initiated during a state of delirium or confusion.
E. The act was not undertaken solely for a political or religious objective.

Specify if:
**Current:** Not more than 12 months since the last attempt.
**In early remission:** 12–24 months since the last attempt.

Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

The Childhood and Adolescent Disorders Work Group proposed nonsuicidal self-in-
jury with the rationale that these symptoms are poorly represented in DSM. The clos-
est approximation is Item 5 in the criteria set for DSM-IV borderline personality
disorder: “recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating be-
havior.” Research shows that repeated self-injury co-occurs in both adolescents and
adults with a variety of diagnoses, and many of these individuals do not meet criteria
for borderline personality disorder. The criteria correct the following misinformation
regarding self-injury: 1) that it is pathognomonic of borderline personality disorder,
and 2) that it is a form of attempted suicide. Neither statement is true, yet both have
the potential to lead to overly restrictive or inappropriate clinical management (e.g.,
inpatient hospitalization, lengthy and complex psychotherapies). These criteria help
distinguish nonsuicidal self-injury and attempted suicide. For most individuals, the
former is not designed to result in death but rather to bring relief from tension and


**480** DSM-5 Guidebook

other negative affects. These behaviors (e.g., cutting, burning) tend to have low lethal-
ity. The proposed definition requires that injuries be superficial and frequently re-
peated. Most individuals who engage in these behaviors are aware of their non-life-
threatening nature. Nevertheless, recurrent self-injurious behaviors are associated
with an elevated risk for attempted and completed suicide.
One concern about the criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury is that borderline per-
sonality disorder is not specifically excluded. Although self-harm is not specific for the
diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, the two are tightly linked, so the exclu-
sion should be clear.

Proposed Criteria for Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

A. In the last year, the individual has, on 5 or more days, engaged in intentional self-
inflicted damage to the surface of his or her body of a sort likely to induce bleeding,
bruising, or pain (e.g., cutting, burning, stabbing, hitting, excessive rubbing), with the
expectation that the injury will lead to only minor or moderate physical harm (i.e., there
is no suicidal intent).
**Note:** The absence of suicidal intent has either been stated by the individual or can
be inferred by the individual’s repeated engagement in a behavior that the individ-
ual knows, or has learned, is not likely to result in death.
B. The individual engages in the self-injurious behavior with one or more of the fol-
lowing expectations:

1. To obtain relief from a negative feeling or cognitive state.
2. To resolve an interpersonal difficulty.
3. To induce a positive feeling state.
**Note:** The desired relief or response is experienced during or shortly after the self-
injury, and the individual may display patterns of behavior suggesting a depen-
dence on repeatedly engaging in it.
C. The intentional self-injury is associated with at least one of the following:
1. Interpersonal difficulties or negative feelings or thoughts, such as depression,
anxiety, tension, anger, generalized distress, or self-criticism, occurring in the
period immediately prior to the self-injurious act.
2. Prior to engaging in the act, a period of preoccupation with the intended behav-
ior that is difficult to control.
3. Thinking about self-injury that occurs frequently, even when it is not acted
upon.

D. The behavior is not socially sanctioned (e.g., body piercing, tattooing, part of a re-
ligious or cultural ritual) and is not restricted to picking a scab or nail biting.
E. The behavior or its consequences cause clinically significant distress or interfer-
ence in interpersonal, academic, or other important areas of functioning.
F. The behavior does not occur exclusively during psychotic episodes, delirium, sub-
stance intoxication, or substance withdrawal. In individuals with a neurodevelop-
mental disorder, the behavior is not part of a pattern of repetitive stereotypies. The
behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder or medical condition


**_Conditions for Further Study_** **481**

```
(e.g., psychotic disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, Lesch-
Nyhan syndrome, stereotypic movement disorder with self-injury, trichotillomania
[hair-pulling disorder], excoriation [skin-picking] disorder).
```
KEY POINTS

- This chapter includes proposed disorders that may be included in future edi-
    tions of DSM. Their inclusion in DSM-5 provides an opportunity for establishing
    standardized criteria to facilitate research.
- To achieve full disorder status, the condition should be “unrepresented” (or not
    well represented in DSM); have clinical value; have the potential to improve ac-
    curate identification and/or treatment; and be prevalent, impairing, and distinctive.
- DSM-5 includes eight criteria sets in Section III in the chapter “Conditions for
    Further Study.” For each condition, it was concluded that insufficient data are
    currently available to warrant inclusion as an official DSM diagnosis. The con-
    ditions include attenuated psychosis syndrome, which became a lightning rod
    in the DSM-5 deliberations; depressive episodes with short-duration hypoma-
    nia; persistent complex bereavement disorder; caffeine use disorder; Internet
    gaming disorder; neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol ex-
    posure; suicidal behavior disorder; and nonsuicidal self-injury.
