## The diagnostic class schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic dis-

orders comprises schizophrenia and related disorders, other major psychoses, and
disorders with subthreshold psychoses (Table 4–1). All are unified by the presence of
one or more of the following five domains of psychopathology: delusions, hallucina-
tions, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and nega-
tive symptoms. Whereas the first four domains are examples of psychosis, negative
symptoms are characterized by the absence of something that should be present, such
as fluency and spontaneity of verbal expression. The term _psychosis_ holds different
meanings, but beginning with DSM-III, the term has had a more restricted definition
that requires the person to experience a break with reality. In the psychoanalytic era, the
term was often used to describe persons who were severely ill and functionally im-
paired but had a broad range of problems and symptoms.

Schizophrenia is arguably the most disabling of the psychoses, yet other psychotic
disorders are also important to recognize and diagnose. These include delusional dis-
order, brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and schizoaffective disorder.
The chapter also includes psychoses that are attributable to other medical conditions
or are induced by substances or medications. Catatonic disorder due to another med-
ical condition has been moved to this chapter and is used for those cases in which the
disorder is medically induced. Unspecified catatonia is new to DSM-5. Other specified
and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders constitute re-
sidual categories that are used to describe psychotic symptoms that do not fit into any
of the better-defined categories.
All psychotic disorders are included in this chapter of DSM-5 except those related
to bipolar disorder, depressive disorders, or a neurocognitive disorder. This organiza-
tion should help facilitate the differential diagnosis of psychotic disorders.
Several important changes have been made to this class. The most basic change in-
volves overall chapter organization. Disorders are now arranged along a gradient
from least to most severe. Severity is defined by the level, number, and duration of
psychotic signs and symptoms. DSM-5 cautions users to diagnose more severe condi-
tions once the lesser conditions are ruled out. Clinicians know (and trainees learn) that
for many individuals the diagnostic process may take months or even years because
signs and symptoms evolve gradually. For example, a young man evaluated for social
withdrawal and magical thinking may have symptoms that initially meet criteria for
schizotypal personality disorder, but several years later he may develop frank delu-
sions and hallucinations that meet criteria for schizophrenia. At the same time, the cli-
nician needs to have ruled out alternative explanations, such as a substance use
disorder or another medical condition, in order to arrive at the best diagnosis.
Schizotypal personality disorder is included in this chapter because of its member-
ship in the schizophrenia spectrum, but criteria and text are found with the personality


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **63**

disorders (see Chapter 18, “Personality Disorders”). The criteria for delusional disor-
der are mostly unchanged, but the adjective _nonbizarre_ has been removed (Criterion A),
and the somatic subtype has been edited to ensure that those who are delusional re-
garding a “physical defect” are more appropriately diagnosed with body dysmorphic
disorder, now placed in the chapter “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders”
(see Chapter 7). In DSM-IV, body dysmorphic disorder was included with the somato-
form disorders.
Shared psychotic disorder has been eliminated because the diagnosis was infre-
quently used and persons whose symptoms met criteria for the diagnosis generally
also met criteria for some other psychotic disorder (e.g., delusional disorder). The es-
sence of shared psychotic disorder is the transmission of delusional beliefs from one
person to another. In the past, these rare cases were called _folie à deux,_ a French term
for “double insanity.”
Clinicians will no longer record schizophrenia subtypes. Although the paranoid,
disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, and residual subtypes have a lengthy his-
tory that predates DSM-I (McGlashan and Fenton 1994), there was little evidence to
support either their clinical utility or their predictive validity (Helmes and Landmark
2003). Because the course of schizophrenia is highly variable, the subtypes had little
stability, so that at various stages of illness it was not unusual for a person’s symp-
toms to meet criteria for different subtypes. For example, a person’s symptoms may
have met the criteria for disorganized subtype early in the illness and then met crite-
ria for the paranoid subtype and, eventually, the residual subtype later in the course
of the illness.
The criteria for schizoaffective disorder have been modified to provide more guid-
ance to clinicians regarding the total duration of mood symptoms. Instead of requir-
ing that mood symptoms last a “substantial portion of the total duration of the active
and residual periods of the illness” (as in DSM-IV [American Psychiatric Association
1994]), DSM-5 requires that they be present for a “majority of the total duration of the
active and residual portions of the illness.” The change was prompted by the low re-
liability of the criterion and its limited clinical utility.
The Psychotic Disorders Work Group had debated the possible inclusion of atten-
uated psychosis syndrome. The syndrome is a collection of symptoms associated
with a high probability of the person developing schizophrenia. The impetus to in-
clude this condition was that it would help to identify those likely to develop schizo-
phrenia, thereby allowing early clinical attention and treatment. The decision was
made to include this syndrome in Section III, in “Conditions for Further Study” (see
Chapter 22) but include it as an example of an other specified schizophrenia spectrum
and other psychotic disorder.

Schizotypal (Personality) Disorder

Schizotypal personality disorder is included in this chapter because of its presence
within the the schizophrenia specturum. Criteria and text for the disorder are found
in the chapter on personality disorders (see Chapter 18).


**64** DSM-5 Guidebook

Delusional Disorder

Delusional disorder is a diagnosis used in individuals who have persistent delusions
but relatively normal psychosocial functioning apart from the ramifications of the de-
lusions and who exhibit behavior that is not obviously odd or bizarre. First included
in DSM-III under the rubric “paranoid disorder,” the name was changed to delusional
(paranoid) disorder in DSM-III-R because while delusions are the primary symptoms,
the term _paranoid_ has many other meanings.
Delusional disorders have a long history. Kraepelin distinguished paranoia from
_dementia praecox_ and used the diagnosis for persons with systematized delusions (but
no hallucinations) and a prolonged course without recovery but not leading to mental
deterioration. Traditionally, the diagnosis has been used for persons who have nonbi-
zarre (i.e., possible but not plausible) delusions but whose functioning is relatively
well preserved, without the deterioration in functioning seen in persons with schizo-
phrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Because these individuals experience their de-
lusional beliefs as ego-syntonic (i.e., consistent with their own expectations, sense of
self, and sense of reality in general), their insight is poor and they generally have little
interest in seeking treatment.
In DSM-5, a number of changes have been made to the diagnosis. The adjective
_nonbizarre_ has been removed from Criterion A. One reason is that “bizarreness” is of-
ten hard to judge, especially across different cultures (Cermolacce et al. 2010). An-
other reason behind the change is more practical and stems in part from a change in
the definition of schizophrenia, in which the special treatment of bizarre delusions
has been deleted from Criterion A. With this change, the presence of a single bizarre
delusion no longer satisfies Criterion A for schizophrenia. Removing the term _non-
bizarre_ from the criteria for delusional disorder was necessary to allow a place within
the delusional disorder category for the rare individual with a single bizarre delusion.
The work group found little justification for differential treatment of delusions based
on whether they are bizarre or nonbizarre. The addition of the “with bizarre content”
specifier allows for the recording of the nature of the delusion and permits continuity
with DSM-IV. This specifier is used when the delusions are thought to be clearly im-
plausible.
Criterion E has been added to rule out other mental disorders, including body
dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition, the somatic
subtype has been edited to delete the phrase “some physical defect.” Both changes
will help ensure that those who are delusional regarding a “physical defect” are more
appropriately diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder, which is now included
with the new diagnostic class obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (see Chap-
ter 7). The work group felt that this change was necessary because people with body
dysmorphic disorder—delusional or not—have a course of illness similar to those
with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and tend to respond to selective serotonin reup-
take inhibitor medications. The changes help to distinguish delusional disorder from
body dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs, and obsessive-
compulsive disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs.


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **65**

Diagnostic Criteria for Delusional Disorder **297.1 (F22)**

A. The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month or longer.
B. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met.
**Note:** Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delu-
sional theme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with insects associated with
delusions of infestation).
C. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning is not
markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd.
D. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief rel-
ative to the duration of the delusional periods.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or
another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disor-
der, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Specify whether:
**Erotomanic type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion
is that another person is in love with the individual.
**Grandiose type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is
the conviction of having some great (but unrecognized) talent or insight or having
made some important discovery.
**Jealous type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the individual’s
delusion is that his or her spouse or lover is unfaithful.
**Persecutory type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion
involves the individual’s belief that he or she is being conspired against, cheated,
spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or ob-
structed in the pursuit of long-term goals.
**Somatic type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion in-
volves bodily functions or sensations.
**Mixed type:** This subtype applies when no one delusional theme predominates.
**Unspecified type:** This subtype applies when the dominant delusional belief
cannot be clearly determined or is not described in the specific types (e.g., ref-
erential delusions without a prominent persecutory or grandiose component).
Specify if:
**With bizarre content:** Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implau-
sible, not understandable, and not derived from ordinary life experiences (e.g.,
an individual’s belief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and
replaced them with someone else’s organs without leaving any wounds or
scars).
Specify if:
The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year duration of the dis-
order:
**First episode, currently in acute episode:** First manifestation of the disorder
meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is
a time period in which the symptom criteria are fulfilled.
**First episode, currently in partial remission:** Partial remission is a time period


**66** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
during which an improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in
which the defining criteria of the disorder are only partially fulfilled.
First episode, currently in full remission: Full remission is a period of time af-
ter a previous episode during which no disorder-specific symptoms are present.
Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode
Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission
Multiple episodes, currently in full remission
Continuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder
are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with subthreshold symptom
periods being very brief relative to the overall course.
Unspecified
```
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psy-
chomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be
rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Di-
mensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,”
this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of delusional disorder can be made without using this severity
specifier.

Criterion A

Delusional disorder requires the presence of delusions for a minimum of 1 month.
DSM-IV specified that the delusions were nonbizarre. Although the term _nonbizarre_
has been deleted, the spirit of the disorder as involving persons with nonbizarre de-
lusions remains, as indicated by the various subtypes. Individuals with schizophre-
nia often have very bizarre delusions not possible in real life. For example, we have
had patients claim they are being controlled by radio transmitters implanted in their
brains (although with rapidly developing technology, that situation may be possible
in the future).

Criterion B

Excluding symptoms that meet Criterion A of schizophrenia has helped to separate de-
lusional disorder from schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia have other psychotic
symptoms (hallucinations; disorganized speech; grossly abnormal behavior, including
catatonia) in addition to negative symptoms. Although individuals with delusional dis-
order may have tactile and olfactory hallucinations that relate to their delusion, they are
otherwise free of those symptoms common to persons with schizophrenia (e.g., audi-
tory hallucinations). For example, individuals with delusional disorder, somatic type,
may have delusions of being infested with parasites and report feeling them moving
about under their skin. (This particular delusion has been referred to as _delusional para-
sitosis_ and is more commonly seen by dermatologists.)


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **67**

Criterion C

People with delusional disorder do not behave in an obviously odd or bizarre fash-
ion. This is an important distinction from people with schizophrenia, who often act in
strange ways, such as muttering to themselves, wearing dirty or inappropriate cloth-
ing, or accosting strangers. The purpose of this criterion is to ensure that delusional
disorder is restricted to persons who, apart from their delusion or its ramifications,
are able to function. That said, the behavior of some persons is greatly influenced by
their delusions, and this can be reflected in their actions. For example, a person in love
with a television actress may attempt to contact the person, or in rare cases may stalk
her. A person who thinks his wife is unfaithful may read her private e-mail or monitor
her daily activities in an attempt to catch her with the paramour.

Criterion D

If persons with delusional disorder have had concurrent mood episodes, these epi-
sodes must have been relatively brief. The goal is to separate delusional disorder from
psychotic forms of major depressive disorder. Individuals with the latter may de-
velop delusions in the context of suffering severe depression, but these delusions tend
to have depressive content, such as believing oneself to have committed a sinful act
or to have lost all of one’s savings. If the delusions occur exclusively during the course
of the depressive illness, the diagnosis is a mood disorder with psychotic features.
Individuals with delusional disorder often have significant depressive symptoms.
The clinician may feel that the symptoms merit an independent diagnosis of major
depressive disorder or other specified or unspecified depressive disorder (or if there
is a bipolar course, other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder).
Schizoaffective disorder is another diagnostic possibility if the delusions are long-
standing and the mood disorder is severe.

Criterion E

This criterion excludes delusional disorders attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance or another medical condition or are better explained by another mental
disorder. Delusions can result from a variety of medical illnesses, certain medical treat-
ments or medications (e.g., corticosteroids), and use of drugs of abuse (e.g., stimu-
lants). This criterion requires ruling out neurocognitive disorders, such as a dementia,
as well as traumatic brain injuries or a convulsive disorder. Also, certain forms of body
dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder are relatively severe and are
associated with delusions (e.g., when an individual believes his normal-appearing
nose is ugly and misshapen). Even when the belief reaches delusional proportions, the
diagnosis body dysmorphic disorder is more appropriate than delusional disorder.

Subtypes and Specifiers

Subtypes are used to indicate the specific theme the disorder has taken, such as ero-
tomania or grandiosity. Bizarreness, course of the disorder, and current severity can
also be specified.


**68** DSM-5 Guidebook

Brief Psychotic Disorder

Brief psychotic disorder is a diagnosis used for relatively brief episodes of psychosis
lasting at least 1 day but less than 1 month. The disorder is relatively uncommon and
occurs in persons who otherwise have not experienced a decline in their day-to-day
functioning or who display signs that in retrospect suggest the prodrome of schizo-
phrenia. Further, the psychotic symptoms associated with this diagnosis tend to be
brought on by stressful situations or acute mood changes. In the past, this diagnosis
was often referred to as a reactive, hysterical, or psychogenic psychosis. The diagno-
sis is essentially unchanged from DSM-IV except for minor editing and the addition
of the specifiers for catatonia and current severity.
Some individuals report new-onset psychotic symptoms that last minutes to hours
and that therefore do not qualify for the diagnosis. These symptoms can occur in per-
sons with borderline personality disorder or schizotypal personality disorder; in
these cases no additional diagnosis is necessary. Otherwise, when these short-lived
symptoms occur, and they are not attributable to a medication, a drug of abuse, or an-
other medical condition, the diagnosis other specified or unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder may be appropriate.

Diagnostic Criteria for Brief Psychotic Disorder **298.8 (F23)**

A. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms. At least one of these must
be (1), (2), or (3):

1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
**Note:** Do not include a symptom if it is a culturally sanctioned response.
B. Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less than 1 month,
with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or bipolar disorder
with psychotic features or another psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or
catatonia, and is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

Specify if:
**With marked stressor(s)** (brief reactive psychosis): If symptoms occur in re-
sponse to events that, singly or together, would be markedly stressful to almost
anyone in similar circumstances in the individual’s culture.
**Without marked stressor(s):** If symptoms do not occur in response to events
that, singly or together, would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar
circumstances in the individual’s culture.
**With postpartum onset:** If onset is during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum.
Specify if:
**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental
disorder, DSM-5, pp. 119–120, for definition)


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **69**

```
Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with
brief psychotic disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia.
```
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psy-
chomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be
rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Di-
mensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,”
this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder can be made without using this se-
verity specifier.

Criterion A

Psychotic symptoms must be present, and the Criterion A list for brief psychotic dis-
order replicates that for schizophrenia _except_ that negative symptoms are not in-
cluded; these usually occur over long periods of time and do not generally present
acutely. The diagnosis does not apply when the psychotic symptoms appear to have
developed in response to culturally sanctioned activities, such as _Qigong,_ a Chinese
health-enhancing practice that can reportedly lead to transient psychosis. This is an
important consideration, because psychotic-like phenomena are reported to occur
during extended religious or ceremonial rituals in several non-Western cultures.

Criterion B

The disturbance lasts at least 1 day but less than 1 month. If the duration is longer, the
person will presumably qualify for another diagnosis, such as schizophreniform dis-
order.

Criterion C

The language has been edited for consistency within DSM-5, but otherwise this crite-
rion is unchanged from DSM-IV. Mood disorders, other psychotic disorders, medical
conditions, and the physiological effects of substances need to be ruled out as a cause
of the disturbance.

Specifiers

When the disorder occurs in response to stressors, the clinician can use the specifier
“with marked stressor(s).” If brief psychotic disorder occurs within 4 weeks postpar-
tum, the “with postpartum onset” specifier is appropriate. Typically, women with
postpartum onset generally develop symptoms within 1–2 weeks of delivery. Symp-
toms can include disorganized speech, misperceptions, labile mood, confusion, and
hallucinations. Frequently referred to as “postpartum psychosis,” the disorder tends
to arise in otherwise normally functioning individuals. The disorder should be distin-


**70** DSM-5 Guidebook

guished from the “baby blues,” which occurs in many new mothers and may last for
a few days after delivery but is not considered pathologic. The new specifier “with
catatonia” can be used when the full syndrome is present. Current severity can be
specified as well.

Schizophreniform Disorder

The term _schizophreniform_ was used by Gabriel Langfeldt (1939) to describe acute psy-
choses that were reactive and occurred in persons with relatively normal person-
alities. Such cases were referred to as “acute schizophrenic episodes” in DSM-II.
Schizophreniform disorder was formally recognized in DSM-III as one of several psy-
chotic disorders not elsewhere classified. The diagnosis is used for symptoms of
schizophrenia that last at least 1 month but less than 6 months. Once the symptoms
have lasted 6 months or longer, the diagnosis changes to schizophrenia, even if only
residual symptoms remain (e.g., blunted affect).
The validity of schizophreniform disorder has been debated. Some individuals di-
agnosed with this disorder develop schizophrenia, whereas others develop a mood
disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Persons with schizophreniform disorder have a
relatively better prognosis than those diagnosed with schizophrenia at first encounter.

Diagnostic Criteria for Schizophreniform Disorder **295.40 (F20.81)**

A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time dur-
ing a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must
be (1), (2), or (3):

1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition).
B. An episode of the disorder lasts at least 1 month but less than 6 months. When
the diagnosis must be made without waiting for recovery, it should be qualified
as “provisional.”
C. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic fea-
tures have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic epi-
sodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood
episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present
for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance
(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

Specify if:
**With good prognostic features:** This specifier requires the presence of at least
two of the following features: onset of prominent psychotic symptoms within 4
weeks of the first noticeable change in usual behavior or functioning; confusion


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **71**

```
or perplexity; good premorbid social and occupational functioning; and absence
of blunted or flat affect.
Without good prognostic features: This specifier is applied if two or more of
the above features have not been present.
```
Specify if:
**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental
disorder, DSM-5, pp. 119–120, for definition).
**Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with
schizophreniform disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia.

Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psy-
chomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be
rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Di-
mensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,”
this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder can be made without using this
severity specifier.

The criteria require that the individual’s symptoms meet schizophrenia Criterion
A (psychotic symptoms), as well as schizophrenia Criteria D and E (which require
that other mental disorders, substances of abuse, and other medical disorders have
been ruled out as a cause of the disorder). Because the individual would have new-
onset symptoms, alternative explanations need to be ruled out during a comprehen-
sive evaluation.
The clinician should specify whether the individual has good prognostic features,
such as acute onset, confusion or perplexity, good premorbid functioning, and ab-
sence of a flattened affect—all of which are symptoms identified in research studies
as correlating with good prognosis. Catatonic features should be specified if present.
Current severity can also be specified.

Schizophrenia

In DSM-5, schizophrenia is defined by a group of characteristic symptoms, such as
delusions, hallucinations, and negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expres-
sion or avolition); deterioration in social, occupational, or interpersonal functioning;
and continuous signs of the disturbance for at least 6 months. No symptoms are spe-
cific—or pathognomonic—to schizophrenia, complicating the task of establishing the
proper boundaries for the disorder.
Kraepelin (1919) is generally credited for producing the first coherent definition
of schizophrenia, which he called _dementia praecox._ His conceptualization was of an
early-onset illness characterized by psychotic symptoms with a chronic and deterio-
rating course. He was also instrumental in separating dementia praecox from manic-
depressive illness, which had its onset throughout life and had a more episodic course.


**72** DSM-5 Guidebook

Kraepelin’s emphasis on psychotic symptoms and a deteriorating course helped to iden-
tify a relatively narrow group of severely ill patients with chronic symptoms and poor
prognosis.
_Dementia praecox_ was eventually renamed _schizophrenia_ by Bleuler (1950) in 1911 to
emphasize the cognitive impairment that occurs, which he saw as a “splitting” of the
psychic processes. Bleuler maintained that certain symptoms were fundamental to the
illness, including affective blunting, disturbance of association (i.e., peculiar and dis-
torted thinking), autism, and indecisiveness (ambivalence). He de-emphasized course
and regarded delusions and hallucinations as accessory symptoms because they could
occur in other disorders. Bleuler ’s ideas earned acceptance and guided the practice of
generations of American and European psychiatrists who were taught the importance
of Bleuler’s fundamental symptoms (“the four A’s”). Because these symptoms were im-
precise, they defined a much more heterogeneous group of patients, often much less ill
than those identified by Kraepelin, and contributed to an increasingly broad concept of
schizophrenia.
The ideas of Kurt Schneider (1959) helped reshape the concept of schizophrenia
into that of a relatively severe psychotic disorder, bringing it back to the original ideas
of Kraepelin. He described “first-rank” psychotic symptoms that he believed were
relatively specific and that thus helped to discriminate schizophrenia from other dis-
orders. These symptoms included thought insertion, thought withdrawal, thought
broadcasting, voices communicating with (or about) the person, and delusions of be-
ing externally controlled (i.e., delusions of passivity). Schneider’s description of
schizophrenia emphasized the presence of one or more of these psychotic symptoms
and was cross-sectional in its definition of the illness. Although later research sug-
gested that these “Schneiderian” symptoms were not particularly specific (Nor-
dgaard et al. 2008), Schneider’s ideas gained prominence and influenced DSM-III,
DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV with their special treatment of “bizarre” delusions and cer-
tain hallucinations.
With DSM-5, modest changes have been made in the criteria for schizophrenia.
The main change has been to eliminate the special status of Schneiderian first-rank
symptoms, including bizarre delusions and certain hallucinations such as voices con-
versing. The recommendation was also made to eliminate schizophrenia subtypes.
Work group members agreed that the classic subtypes provided a poor description of
the heterogeneity of the disorder and had low diagnostic stability, with only the par-
anoid and undifferentiated subtypes being used with any frequency.

Diagnostic Criteria for Schizophrenia **295.90 (F20.9)**

A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during
a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1),
(2), or (3):

1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **73**

3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition).

B. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of func-
tioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-
care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is
in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interper-
sonal, academic, or occupational functioning).
C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month pe-
riod must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that
meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodro-
mal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs
of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or
more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd be-
liefs, unusual perceptual experiences).
D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features
have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes
have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood epi-
sodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for
a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of
childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if promi-
nent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of
schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully
treated).

Specify if:
The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year duration of the dis-
order and if they are not in contradiction to the diagnostic course criteria.
**First episode, currently in acute episode:** First manifestation of the disorder
meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is
a time period in which the symptom criteria are fulfilled.
**First episode, currently in partial remission:** Partial remission is a period of
time during which an improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in
which the defining criteria of the disorder are only partially fulfilled.
**First episode, currently in full remission:** Full remission is a period of time af-
ter a previous episode during which no disorder-specific symptoms are present.
**Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode:** Multiple episodes may be de-
termined after a minimum of two episodes (i.e., after a first episode, a remission
and a minimum of one relapse).
**Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission
Multiple episodes, currently in full remission
Continuous:** Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder
are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with subthreshold symptom
periods being very brief relative to the overall course.
**Unspecified**

Specify if:
**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental
disorder, DSM-5, pp. 119–120, for definition).
**Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with
schizophrenia to indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia.

Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psy-
chomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be
rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Di-
mensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,”
this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of schizophrenia can be made without using this severity spec-
ifier.

Criterion A

At least one of the two required symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or dis-
organized speech. These three are core “positive symptoms” that are diagnosed with
high reliability and might reasonably be considered necessary for a diagnosis of
schizophrenia. In DSM-IV, only one characteristic symptom was required if it was a
bizarre delusion or “first-rank” hallucination. Because bizarre delusions and first-
rank hallucinations have little diagnostic specificity and their reliability is poor (Bell
et al. 2006), these “positive symptoms” are now treated like any other with regard to
their diagnostic implication: as with other characteristic symptoms, two Criterion A
symptoms need to be present for a diagnosis of schizophrenia. This change also elim-
inates the possibility that an individual with only catatonia and negative symptoms
will receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
To better describe the nature of the affective abnormality in schizophrenia, the fifth
characteristic type of symptoms in Criterion A—negative symptoms—has been changed
from “affective flattening, alogia, or avolition” (as in DSM-IV) to “diminished emo-
tional expression or avolition.” This change to emphasize restricted affect should help
clarify and more accurately describe the individual’s presentation.

Criterion B

Schizophrenia involves impairment in one or more major areas of functioning. Typi-
cally, functioning is clearly below prior levels of achievement, or, if the disturbance
begins in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of functioning is not attained.

Criterion C

Signs of the disturbance must persist continuously for at least 6 months. During at least
1 month of that time, symptoms must meet Criterion A (active-phase symptoms). Pro-
dromal symptoms often proceed the active phase, and residual symptoms may follow.


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **75**

Some prodromal and residual symptoms are mild or subthreshold forms of hallucina-
tions or delusions. Individuals may express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are
not of delusional proportions; these are often referred to as “magical thinking” or “ideas
of reference.” The individual may report having unusual perceptual experiences, such
as sensing the presence of an unseen person. The person’s speech may be generally un-
derstandable but vague or digressive, while his or her behavior may be unusual but not
grossly disorganized, such as muttering to oneself in public. Negative symptoms are
common in the prodromal and residual phases and can be severe.

Criterion D

Although mood symptoms and mood episodes are common and may be concurrent
with active-phase symptoms, individuals with schizophrenia must have delusions or
hallucinations in the absence of mood episodes, or the total duration of the mood ep-
isodes must be present for only a minority of the total duration of the active and re-
sidual periods of the illness. Otherwise, schizoaffective disorder may be the more
appropriate diagnosis.

Criterion E

Before making a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the clinician must rule out a wide variety
of medical conditions that can present with psychotic symptoms, and must exclude
drug-induced psychoses and psychoses attributable to delirium or other medical con-
ditions (e.g., epilepsy, brain tumors, inflammatory brain disorders).

Criterion F

If the individual has a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication dis-
order of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if
prominent delusions or hallucinations, and the other required symptoms of schizo-
phrenia, have been present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).

Specifiers

Multiple specifiers are provided to better describe the individual’s course of illness.
Catatonia may be specified if the full syndrome is present. Catatonic behaviors that
may have previously led to the diagnosis of a catatonic subtype of schizophrenia are
now covered in Criterion A4, which involves the presence of “grossly disorganized
or catatonic behavior.” The following additional diagnostic categories should be con-
sidered if the individual’s symptoms are predominantly catatonic: catatonia associated
with another mental disorder, catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, and
unspecified catatonia.

Schizoaffective Disorder

_Schizoaffective_ is a term first used by Jacob Kasanin (1933) to describe a small group of
severely ill patients with a mix of psychotic and mood symptoms. In DSM-5, the hall-


**76** DSM-5 Guidebook

mark of schizoaffective disorder is the presence of either a major depressive or a manic
mood episode concurrent with psychotic symptoms that meet schizophrenia Crite-
rion A, such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized
or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms. Additionally, mood symptoms must be
a _prominent_ feature of the condition and not a minor aspect. Other causes of these
symptoms, including other medical conditions, substances of abuse, and medica-
tions, must be ruled out. The symptoms typically present together, or sometimes in
an alternating fashion; psychotic symptoms may be mood-congruent or mood-incon-
gruent.
Although schizoaffective disorder has long filled an important role in psychiatric
practice, the diagnosis has suffered from low reliability. This situation began in 1980
when the diagnosis was included in DSM-III but had no operational criteria. Instead,
two clinical vignettes were described in which the diagnosis was used. Criteria were
introduced in DSM-III-R, and these continued mostly unchanged through DSM-IV.
The criteria indicated that the mood symptoms had to be present for a “substantial
portion of the total duration” of the illness; however, little guidance was given to help
clinicians judge how long the duration of the mood symptoms should be relative to
the duration of the illness. This gap has now been addressed: a major mood episode
must be present for the majority of the total duration of the active and residual por-
tions of the illness (i.e., the time since Criterion A has been met). This change should
help clarify the boundaries of the disorder by providing guidance to the clinician
about the proportion of time the patient experiences a mood syndrome.

Diagnostic Criteria for Schizoaffective Disorder

A. An uninterrupted period of illness during which there is a major mood episode (ma-
jor depressive or manic) concurrent with Criterion A of schizophrenia.
**Note:** The major depressive episode must include Criterion A1: Depressed mood.
B. Delusions or hallucinations for 2 or more weeks in the absence of a major mood
episode (depressive or manic) during the lifetime duration of the illness.
C. Symptoms that meet criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority
of the total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of
abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

Specify whether:
**295.70 (F25.0) Bipolar type:** This subtype applies if a manic episode is part of
the presentation. Major depressive episodes may also occur.
**295.70 (F25.1) Depressive type:** This subtype applies if only major depressive
episodes are part of the presentation.

Specify if:
**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental
disorder, DSM-5, pp. 119–120, for definition).
**Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with
schizoaffective disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia.


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **77**

Specify if:
The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year duration of the dis-
order and if they are not in contradiction to the diagnostic course criteria.
**First episode, currently in acute episode:** First manifestation of the disorder
meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is
a time period in which the symptom criteria are fulfilled.
**First episode, currently in partial remission:** Partial remission is a time period
during which an improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in
which the defining criteria of the disorder are only partially fulfilled.
**First episode, currently in full remission:** Full remission is a period of time af-
ter a previous episode during which no disorder-specific symptoms are present.
**Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode:** Multiple episodes may be de-
termined after a minimum of two episodes (i.e., after a first episode, a remission
and a minimum of one relapse).
**Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission
Multiple episodes, currently in full remission
Continuous:** Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder
are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with subthreshold symptom
periods being very brief relative to the overall course.
**Unspecified**

Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psy-
chomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be
rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Di-
mensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,”
this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder can be made without using this se-
verity specifier.

Criterion A

The presence of psychotic and mood symptoms is the essence of schizoaffective dis-
order. There must be an uninterrupted period in which major depressive or manic
symptoms must be concurrent with Criterion A (of schizophrenia) psychotic symp-
toms. In fact, for many if not most individuals, the actual duration of the symptom
overlap is a matter of months or years, not days or weeks.

Criterion B

An important change in DSM-5 is that psychotic symptoms have to be present for 2
or more weeks in the absence of a major mood episode (depressive or manic) “during
the lifetime duration of the illness” rather than “during the same period of illness” as
in DSM-IV. This change was prompted by the goal of making explicit that the diagnosis


**78** DSM-5 Guidebook

of schizoaffective disorder is based on the assessment of psychotic and mood symp-
toms during the lifetime duration of the illness. DSM-IV implied that a “period of ill-
ness” could refer, at a minimum, to a single _episode_ of illness lasting at least 1 month
(to meet Criterion A) or, at a maximum, to the _lifetime duration_ of the illness. To in-
crease reliability, the authors of DSM-IV restricted the diagnosis to a given episode.
This resulted in a person’s receiving a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, schizo-
phreniform disorder, schizophrenia, or even a psychotic mood disorder at various
times during the illness.

Criterion C

The DSM-IV phrase “substantial portion of the total duration of the active and resid-
ual periods of the illness” has been replaced with “majority of the total duration of
the active and residual portions, of the illness.” The change was necessary because of
the low reliability of the criterion and its limited clinical utility. Furthermore, the rel-
ative proportion of mood and psychotic symptoms can change over time, and clini-
cians and researchers often used different thresholds when applying this criterion.
Researchers in several large studies had set the figure at 30% for total duration of their
mood episodes (relative to the total duration of psychosis), but after examining field
trial data the Psychotic Disorders Work Group recommended a threshold set at 50%
as indicated by the word _majority._ Also new to DSM-5, Criterion C requires the assess-
ment of mood symptoms not only during a current period of illness but over the entire
course of a psychotic illness. If the mood symptoms are present for only a relatively
brief period of time, the diagnosis is schizophrenia rather than schizoaffective disor-
der. When deciding whether an individual meets Criterion C, the clinician should re-
view the total duration of psychotic illness (i.e., both active and residual symptoms)
and determine when significant mood symptoms (untreated or in need of treatment
with antidepressant and/or mood-stabilizing medication) accompanied the psy-
chotic symptoms. This requires historical information and clinical judgment. For exam-
ple, an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual symptoms of schizo-
phrenia develops depressive and manic episodes that, taken together, do not occupy
more than 1 year during the 4-year history of psychotic illness. This presentation
would not meet Criterion C. The diagnosis in this example is schizophrenia, with the
additional diagnosis of major depressive disorder to indicate the superimposed de-
pressive episode.

Criterion D

Medical illnesses, medications, and drugs of abuse need to be ruled out as a cause of
the disturbance.

Subtypes and Specifiers

The clinician may indicate whether the presentation includes a manic episode (bipo-
lar type) or whether only major depressive episodes occur (depressive type). The
presence of catatonia may be specified, as may course and current severity.


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **79**

Substance/Medication-Induced

Psychotic Disorder

The essential feature of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is that the
delusions or hallucinations (Criterion A) are judged to be causally related to the ef-
fects of a substance or medication because they have developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal, or following exposure to a medication (Crite-
rion B). Last, the disturbance is not better explained by an independent psychotic dis-
order (Criterion C). The criteria have been edited for clarity and readability but are
otherwise unchanged from DSM-IV. The diagnosis is used when the symptoms are in
_excess_ of those associated with an intoxication or withdrawal syndrome. For example,
because hallucinations can occur during an alcohol withdrawal delirium, an addi-
tional diagnosis of a substance-induced psychotic disorder is not appropriate.
The diagnosis is common among persons who abuse substances, as well as in hos-
pitals and clinics, where medications are often the cause of induced psychotic symp-
toms. The initiation of the disorder varies considerably depending on the substance
and its pharmacological properties. For example, smoking a high dose of cocaine may
produce psychosis within minutes, but days or weeks of high doses of alcohol or
sedatives may be required to produce psychosis. Hallucinations may occur in any
modality, but in the absence of a delirium they are often auditory. Alcohol-induced
psychotic disorder usually occurs only after heavy prolonged use (generally years) in
individuals with an alcohol use disorder. Stimulant medications are known to pro-
duce persecutory delusions, which may develop rapidly following the use of the
stimulant (e.g., amphetamine, methamphetamine). Induced psychotic disorders usu-
ally resolve when the offending agent is withdrawn, although in some cases they can
persist for weeks or months even when the person is treated with antipsychotic med-
ications.
The diagnostic code recorded depends on the class of the substance. Further spec-
ifications include whether the symptoms had an onset during intoxication or with-
drawal, and current severity.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Psychotic Disorder

A. Presence of one or both of the following symptoms:

1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
    Criterion A.


**80** DSM-5 Guidebook

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a psychotic disorder that is not sub-
stance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent psychotic disorder
could include the following:
The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the ces-
sation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence of
an independent non-substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (e.g., a
history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/med-
ication]-induced psychotic disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use dis-
order present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is co-
morbid with the substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is
“1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the sub-
stance-induced psychotic disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-in-
duced psychotic disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and
the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance]
use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only
the substance-induced psychotic disorder.

Specify if (see Table 16–1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders”
for diagnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for intoxication with the
substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
**With onset during withdrawal:** If the criteria are met for withdrawal from the
substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.

Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, abnormal psychomotor behavior,
and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not
present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psycho-
sis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,” this volume.)
**Note:** Diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder can be
made without using this severity specifier.

Criterion A

In DSM-IV, if a person realized that his or her hallucinations were substance or medica-
tion induced, the hallucinations were not counted toward this diagnosis, but this no
longer applies.

Criterion B

The delusions and/or hallucinations must have developed “during or soon after” sub-
stance intoxication or withdrawal or after other exposure to a medication, and the sub-
stance/medication involved must be “capable” of producing the psychosis. This
language is more specific than in DSM-IV, which used the phrase “etiologically related.”

Criteria C, D, and E

This criterion outlines situations that cast doubt on a putative relationship between
the use of a substance and the psychosis. For example, if the symptoms were present
before the onset of substance or medication use, it is likely the psychosis is not sub-
stance induced. Delirium has been excluded as a cause of the psychosis, in which case
the delirium would be separately coded. The disturbance must cause clinically signif-
icant distress or impairment.

Psychotic Disorder Due to Another

Medical Condition

This diagnosis is relatively unchanged from DSM-IV except for the addition of Crite-
rion E to acknowledge the presence of significant distress or impairment. In addition,
there must be evidence that the disorder is the direct pathophysiological consequence
of another medical condition, and the disorder must not occur exclusively in the course
of a delirium (otherwise the diagnosis is delirium). The code used is based on whether
delusions or hallucinations are the predominant symptom. Further, the name of the
medical disorder is included in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., psychotic disor-
der due to malignant lung neoplasm). Current severity can also be recorded.

Diagnostic Criteria for Psychotic Disorder Due to a
Another Medical Condition

A. Prominent hallucinations or delusions.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings
that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another
medical condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Specify whether:
Code based on predominant symptom:
**293.81 (F06.2) With delusions:** If delusions are the predominant symptom.
**293.82 (F06.0) With hallucinations:** If hallucinations are the predominant symptom.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the
mental disorder (e.g., 293.81 [F06.2] psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neo-
plasm, with delusions). The other medical condition should be coded and listed sep-
arately immediately before the psychotic disorder due to the medical condition (e.g.,
162.9 [C34.90] malignant lung neoplasm; 293.81 [F06.2] psychotic disorder due to
malignant lung neoplasm, with delusions).
Specify current severity:
Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including delusions, hallucinations, abnormal psychomotor behavior,
and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not
present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psycho-
sis Symptom Severity in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures,” this volume.)

Catatonia Associated With Another

Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)

Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier) may be used
when criteria are met for catatonia during the course of a neurodevelopmental, psy-
chotic, bipolar, depressive, or other mental disorder. The catatonia specifier is appro-
priate when the clinical picture is characterized by marked psychomotor disturbance
and involves at least 3 of the 12 diagnostic features listed in Criterion A.
While catatonia occurs in over one-third of schizophrenia cases, the majority of
catatonia cases occur in patients with a mood disorder. For this reason, catatonia was
added as an episode specifier for the major mood disorders in DSM-IV. Catatonic symp-
toms need to be recognized because they have prognostic and treatment implications.
The presence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome should be ruled out because of the
serious nature of its complications.
The name of the associated mental disorder should be included when recording
the name of the disorder (e.g., catatonia associated with schizoaffective disorder).

Diagnostic Criteria for Catatonia Associated With
Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier) **293.89 (F06.1)**

A. The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more) of the following symptoms: 

1. Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to environment).
2. Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity).
    3. Waxvy flexibility (i.e., slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner).
4. Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [exclude if known aphasia]).
5. Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli).
6. Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against
    gravity).
7. Mannerism (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions).
8. Stereotypy (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed move-
    ments).
9. Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli.
10. Grimacing.
11. Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another’s speech).
12. Echopraxia (i.e., mimicking another’s movements).

**Coding note:** Indicate the name of the associated mental disorder when recording
the name of the condition (i.e., 293.89 [F06.1] catatonia associated with major depres-
sive disorder). Code first the associated mental disorder (e.g., neurodevelopmental
disorder, brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaf-
fective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or other mental disorder)
(e.g., 295.70 [F25.1] schizoaffective disorder, depressive type; 293.89 [F06.1] catato-
nia associated with schizoaffective disorder).


**84** DSM-5 Guidebook

Catatonic Disorder Due to

Another Medical Condition

Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition has been moved from the DSM-
IV chapter “Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition.” Catatonia has
generally been viewed as a subtype of schizophrenia, as reflected in DSM-IV, but re-
search has shown that catatonic symptoms can result from several medical disorders.
For that reason, catatonic disorder due to a general medical condition was added as
a new category in DSM-IV. The criteria for this disorder have changed to reflect
greater specificity in the symptoms and impairment caused by the condition.

Diagnostic Criteria for Catatonic Disorder
Due to Another Medical Condition **293.89 (F06.1)**

A. The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more) of the following symptoms: 

1. Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to environment).
2. Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity).
3. Waxy flexibility (i.e., slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner).
4. Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [ **Note:** not applicable if there
    is an established aphasia]).
5. Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli).
6. Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against
    gravity).
7. Mannerism (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions).
8. Stereotypy (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed move-
    ments).
9. Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli.
10. Grimacing.
11. Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another’s speech).
12. Echopraxia (i.e., mimicking another’s movements).
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical
condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., a manic ep-
isode).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the medical condition in the name of the mental
disorder (e.g., 293.89 [F06.1]) catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy). The
other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the
catatonic disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 572.2 [K71.90] hepatic enceph-
alopathy; 293.89 [F06.1] catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy).


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **85**

Criterion A

This criterion requires the presence of 3 or more of 12 symptoms typical for catatonia.
In DSM-IV, the criteria were unclear as to how many symptoms were required.

Criteria B and C

Because catatonic symptoms have been associated with a variety of medical disor-
ders, medical conditions apart from the disorder in question need to be ruled out as
a cause. This entails a detailed medical workup to rule out neurological, infectious,
and other potential causes of the symptoms. For example, before concluding that the
catatonia resulted from a herpes-related encephalopathy, the clinician should rule out
brain tumors and other mass lesions.
Catatonic symptoms can occur in the context of other major mental disorders,
such as mania, and these disorders need to be ruled out as well.

Criteria D and E

If the symptoms occur only in the context of a delirium, then delirium is the appro-
priate diagnosis. This criterion is new to DSM-5 and specifies that the symptoms
cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, and other important
areas of functioning.

Unspecified Catatonia

Catatonic syndromes can occur within the context of many other disorders, including
psychotic disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, and general medical condi-
tions. In DSM-5, catatonia is no longer listed as a specific subtype of schizophrenia,
but the text recognizes catatonic disorder as being due to another medical condition,
as a specifier for a psychotic disorder or a depressive or bipolar disorder, or as an un-
specified catatonia.

Unspecified Catatonia

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of catatonia
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning but either the nature of the underlying mental disorder
or other medical condition is unclear, full criteria for catatonia are not met, or there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room
settings).
**Coding note:** Code first **781.99 (R29.818)** other symptoms involving nervous and muscu-
loskeletal systems, followed by **293.89 (F06.1)** unspecified catatonia.

The diagnosis unspecified catatonia may be used when individuals with catatonic
symptoms have clinically significant distress or impairment but the nature of the un-

derlying mental disorder or other medical condition is unclear, the full criteria for
catatonic disorder are not met, or there is insufficient information to make a more spe-
cific diagnosis.

Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and

Other Psychotic Disorder and Unspecified

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic

Disorder

Other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disor-
ders are residual categories for individuals whose symptoms do not fit within one of
the more specific categories. The categories replace DSM-IV’s psychotic disorder not
otherwise specified.
Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder can be used
in situations in which an individual has symptoms characteristic of a spectrum disor-
der that cause distress or impairment but that do not meet full criteria for a more spe-
cific disorder. In this case, the clinician chooses to communicate the reason that
individual’s symptoms do not meet the criteria. Specific examples are given in DSM-
5 to describe situations in which this diagnosis may be appropriate. The category un-
specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder is used when the cli-
nician chooses not to specify the reason that criteria are not met for a more specific
disorder, or when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorder **298.8 (F28)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a schizo-
phrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predom-
inate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spec-
trum and other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The other specified schizophre-
nia spectrum and other psychotic disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not
meet the criteria for any specific schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
This is done by recording “other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “persistent auditory hallucinations”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Persistent auditory hallucinations** occurring in the absence of any other features.
2. **Delusions with significant overlapping mood episodes:** This includes persis-
    tent delusions with periods of overlapping mood episodes that are present for a
    substantial portion of the delusional disturbance (such that the criterion stipulating
    only brief mood disturbance in delusional disorder is not met).


**_Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders_** **87**

3. **Attenuated psychosis syndrome:** This syndrome is characterized by psychotic-
    like symptoms that are below a threshold for full psychosis (e.g., the symptoms are
    less severe and more transient, and insight is relatively maintained).
4. **Delusional symptoms in partner of individual with delusional disorder:** In the
    context of a relationship, the delusional material from the dominant partner pro-
    vides content for delusional belief by the individual who may not otherwise entirely
    meet criteria for delusional disorder.

Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorder **298.9 (F29)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a schizo-
phrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predom-
inate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spec-
trum and other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder category is used in situations in which the cli-
nician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emer-
gency room settings).

Clinician-Rated Dimensions of

Psychosis Symptom Severity

The Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity is available to help
the clinician make detailed assessments of individuals across important domains,
including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor
behavior, negative symptoms, impaired cognition, depression, and mania. This in-
strument is described in Chapter 20, “Assessment Measures.”

KEY POINTS

- Chapter organization has changed so that schizophrenia spectrum and other
    psychotic disorders are arranged along a gradient from least to most severe.
    Severity is defined by the level, number, and duration of psychotic signs and
    symptoms.
- Schizotypal personality disorder has been included in the schizophrenia spec-
    trum, but the criteria and text remain in the personality disorders chapter. Evi-
    dence has accumulated since its initial description in DSM-III confirming its
    close etiological relationship with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.


**88** DSM-5 Guidebook

- In the criteria for delusional disorder, the adjective nonbizarre has been re-
    moved (Criterion A), and the somatic subtype has been edited to ensure that
    individuals with a delusion regarding a physical defect are more appropriately
    diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder.
- The diagnosis shared psychotic disorder has been eliminated because it was
    infrequently used and persons with the diagnosis generally had symptoms that
    met criteria for some other psychotic disorder (e.g., delusional disorder).
- With schizophrenia, bizarre delusions and “first-rank” hallucinations are no longer
    accorded special treatment. Further, clinicians will no longer record schizophre-
    nia subtypes; despite historical precedent, there is scant research evidence sup-
    porting their clinical utility or predictive validity.
- The criteria for schizoaffective disorder now clarify that mood symptoms must
    constitute the “majority of the total duration of the active and residual portions
    of the illness.” The change was necessary because of the low reliability and lim-
    ited clinical utility of the wording in DSM-IV.
