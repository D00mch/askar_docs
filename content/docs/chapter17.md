## The DSM-5 chapter on neurocognitive disorders encompasses disor-

ders that have cognitive impairment as their presenting problem. In DSM-IV, the
chapter was called “Delirium, Dementia, and Amnestic and Other Cognitive Disor-
ders.” The new title refers to disorders that are acquired (i.e., those attributed to med-
ical conditions or the effects of drugs of abuse or medications) or are degenerative


**360** DSM-5 Guidebook

(i.e., those that reflect a decline from a previously attained level of cognitive function-
ing) rather than disorders that are congenital or apparent in childhood. The title was
selected in part to avoid the stigma associated with the word _dementia_ when catego-
rizing deficits among younger people with progressive cognitive decline, such as that
associated with HIV infection or traumatic brain injury. The neurocognitive disorders
are divided into three broad syndromes: delirium, major neurocognitive disorders,
and mild neurocognitive disorders. Disorders in this chapter are attributable to changes
in brain structure, function, or chemistry.
Cognitive disorders have been recognized for centuries and have been an important
category in DSM. In DSM-I, “acute” and “chronic” brain disorders constituted the two
major divisions, each subcategorized by presumed cause (e.g., cerebral arteriosclerosis,
convulsive disorder). In DSM-II, these disorders were listed as either “psychoses asso-
ciated with organic brain syndromes” or “nonpsychotic organic brain syndromes.” The
term _psychosis_ was used to denote severity (i.e., that the condition resulted in suffi-
ciently impaired mental functioning to interfere grossly with the capacity to meet the
ordinary demands of life) rather than the presence of hallucinations or delusions. What
current practitioners might refer to as vascular dementia would have been classified
in DSM-II as psychoses associated with organic brain syndromes with cerebral arterio-
sclerosis or other cerebrovascular disturbance. The term _organic mental disorders_ contin-
ued to be used in DSM-III, although the term _psychosis_ was no longer used to character-
ize severity. The word _organic_ was finally omitted in DSM-IV; it was considered to be
outdated because it implied that other disorders in the manual did not have an or-
ganic component.
The major change to this diagnostic class with DSM-5 is the introduction of the con-
cept of “major” and “mild” neurocognitive disorders. The latter are less severe forms of
cognitive impairment and can be a focus of care. The DSM-5 neurocognitive disorders
are listed in Table 17–1.

DELIRIUM

Delirium

Delirium is a disturbance in level of awareness or attention, marked by the acute or
subacute onset of cognitive changes attributable to a general medical condition; it
tends to have an acute onset, relatively brief duration, and fluctuating course. Delir-
ium is distinguished from major or mild neurocognitive disorders on the basis of its
core characteristics: a disturbance in level of awareness and the reduced ability to di-
rect, focus, sustain, and shift attention. Although some level of disturbance of aware-
ness and attention can be observed in all neurocognitive disorders, these disturbances
are not prominent in major or mild neurocognitive disorder (the relative absence of
this disturbance was previously referred to as “clear consciousness”). Delirium can
(and frequently does) coexist with major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
Diagnosing delirium is important because its underlying cause is often correctable,
whereas untreated delirium is associated with a high mortality rate, serious medical
complications, and irreversible cognitive impairments.

Diagnostic Criteria for Delirium

A. A disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and sh
attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to the environment).
B. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to a few day
represents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and tends to fluct
ate in severity during the course of a day.
C. An additional disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation, la
guage, visuospatial ability, or perception).
D. The disturbances in Criteria A and C are not better explained by another preexi
ing, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder and do not occur in the co
text of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma.

the disturbance is a direct physiological consequence of another medical condi-
tion, substance intoxication or withdrawal (i.e., due to a drug of abuse or to a med-
ication), or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multiple etiologies.

Specify whether:
**Substance intoxication delirium:** This diagnosis should be made instead of sub-
stance intoxication when the symptoms in Criteria A and C predominate in the clin-
ical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific sub-
stance] intoxication delirium are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-
10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use dis-
order present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder
is comorbid with the substance intoxication delirium, the 4th position character
is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the
substance intoxication delirium (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine
intoxication delirium”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is co-
morbid with the substance intoxication delirium, the 4th position character is “2,”
and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe
[substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance
use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-
time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the
clinician should record only the substance intoxication delirium.

the delirium (e.g., 293.0 [F05] delirium due to hepatic encephalopathy). The
other medical condition should also be coded and listed separately immediately
before the delirium due to another medical condition (e.g., 572.2 [K72.90] he-
patic encephalopathy; 293.0 [F05] delirium due to hepatic encephalopathy).
293.0 (F05) Delirium due to multiple etiologies: There is evidence from the his-
tory, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the delirium has more than
one etiology (e.g., more than one etiological medical condition; another medical
condition plus substance intoxication or medication side effect).
Coding note: Use multiple separate codes reflecting specific delirium etiolo-
gies (e.g., 572.2 [K72.90] hepatic encephalopathy, 293.0 [F05] delirium due to
hepatic failure; 291.0 [F10.231] alcohol withdrawal delirium). Note that the etio-
logical medical condition both appears as a separate code that precedes the
delirium code and is substituted into the delirium due to another medical condi-
tion rubric.

**364** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion A

Delirium is a disturbance in level of awareness or attention, marked by the acute or
subacute onset of cognitive changes. The individual’s inability to appreciate or re-
spond appropriately to the environment may be evidenced by problems with focus
or sustained attention, apparent disorientation in familiar settings, and perseverating
in responses. DSM-IV referred to these symptoms as a “disturbance of consciousness.”
_Consciousness,_ however, was considered an imprecise term to describe the symptoms
of delirium.

Criterion B

The course of delirium is usually short, developing over a few hours or a few days.
The delirium usually remits when the underlying cause is identified and successfully
treated.

Criterion C

Memory problems, disorientation, and language difficulties are usually present. Vi-
suospatial impairment and impairment in executive function are also symptoms of
delirium.

Criterion D

DSM-5 has also added a clarification that a preexisting neurocognitive disorder does
not account for the cognitive changes. A severely reduced level of arousal, such as
coma, would not provide a context adequate to assess orientation, attention, and cog-
nitive functioning.

Criterion E

This criterion requires that the disturbance in attention and awareness be a direct
physiological consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or
withdrawal, or exposure to a toxin, or be due to multiple etiologies.

Subtypes and Specifiers

There are multiple subtypes for the diagnosis of delirium that address etiological is-
sues. Two subtypes indicate whether the delirium is due to substance intoxication or
substance withdrawal. These diagnoses should be made instead of substance intoxi-
cation or substance withdrawal when the symptoms in Criteria A and C predominate
in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Sub-
stance intoxication or withdrawal delirium requires, in addition to the standard criteria
for delirium, that the delirium have started during or after intoxication or withdrawal
and that the substance be capable of producing delirium.
The following classes of substances can result in a substance intoxication delirium:
cannabis; phencyclidine and other hallucinogens; stimulants; inhalants; opioids; and
sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics. During withdrawal, alcohol, opioids, and sed-


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **365**

atives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics can be causes of delirium. Other (or unknown) sub-
stances can also be specified.
Another possible subtype is medication-induced delirium. Even in the absence of
intoxication or withdrawal, a number of medications and toxins (e.g., benztropine,
dexamethasone) can lead to delirium.
Other subtypes indicate whether the delirium is due to another medical condition
(e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) or multiple etiologies (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy plus
alcohol withdrawal).
Finally, there are specifiers to indicate whether the delirium is acute (lasting a few
hours to a few days) or persistent (lasting weeks or months) and whether the delirium
gives rise to hyperactive psychomotor activity (often accompanied by mood lability,
agitation, and/or refusal to cooperate with medical care), hypoactive psychomotor
activity (often accompanied by sluggishness and lethargy that approaches stupor), or
a mixed level of activity (normal level of psychomotor activity even though attention
and awareness are disturbed; includes individuals whose activity level rapidly fluctu-
ates). Individuals with delirium may rapidly switch between hyperactive and hypoac-
tive states. The hyperactive state may be more common or more frequently recog-
nized and often is associated with medication side effects and drug withdrawal. The
hypoactive state may be more frequent in older adults.

Other Specified Delirium and

Unspecified Delirium

Other specified delirium or unspecified delirium is coded when it is not possible to
establish an etiological subtype or when the disorder is subsyndromal (i.e., does not
meet full criteria for delirium, such as in attenuated delirium syndrome). Examples
include a clinical presentation of delirium that is suspected to be due to a general
medical condition or substance use but for which there is insufficient evidence to es-
tablish a specific etiology. Such a diagnosis may also be appropriate when the delir-
ium is due to causes not listed in this section (e.g., sensory deprivation).

Other Specified Delirium **780.09 (R41.0)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of delirium
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium
or any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified delirium category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for delir-
ium or any specific neurocognitive disorder. This is done by recording “other specified
delirium” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “attenuated delirium syndrome”).
An example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” des-
ignation is the following:


**366** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
Attenuated delirium syndrome: This syndrome applies in cases of delirium in
which the severity of cognitive impairment falls short of that required for the diag-
nosis, or in which some, but not all, diagnostic criteria for delirium are met.
```
Unspecified Delirium **780.09 (R41.0)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of delirium
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium
or any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The unspec-
ified delirium category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to spec-
ify the reason that the criteria are not met for delirium, and includes presentations for
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emer-
gency room settings).

MAJOR AND MILD NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS

Major Neurocognitive Disorder

Major neurocognitive disorder (including what was formerly known in DSM-IV as
dementia) is an acquired disorder with significant cognitive decline in one or more
(typically at least two) of the following domains:

- _Complex attention_ (sustained attention, divided attention, selective attention, pro-
    cessing speed)
- _Executive function_ (planning, decision making, working memory, responding to
    feedback/error correction, overriding habits, mental flexibility)
- _Learning and memory_ (immediate memory, recent memory [including free recall,
    cued recall, and recognition memory])
- _Language_ (expressive language [including naming, fluency, and grammar and syn-
    tax] and receptive language)
- _Perceptual-motor ability_ (construction and visual perception)
- _Social cognition_ (recognition of emotions, theory of mind, behavioral regulation)

The cognitive deficits must be sufficient to interfere with functional indepen-
dence. Unlike the DSM-IV criteria for dementia, the DSM-5 major neurocognitive dis-
order criteria do not require memory to be one of the impaired domains and allow the
cognitive deficit to be limited to one domain.
Although the word _dementia_ is not precluded from use in the etiological subtypes, it
is subsumed by the newly named entity _major neurocognitive disorder._ The term _dementia_
was considered pejorative and stigmatizing by some, particularly among younger
adults with cognitive deficits related to HIV infection, head injury, or other causes.


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **367**

Diagnostic Criteria for Major Neurocognitive Disorder

A. Evidence of significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in
one or more cognitive domains (complex attention, executive function, learning
and memory, language, perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on:

1. Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician that there
    has been a significant decline in cognitive function; and
2. A substantial impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by
standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another quantified
clinical assessment.

B. The cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday activities (i.e., at a
minimum, requiring assistance with complex instrumental activities of daily living
such as paying bills or managing medications).
C. The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of a delirium.
D. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., ma-
jor depressive disorder, schizophrenia).

Specify whether due to:
**Alzheimer’s disease** (DSM-5, pp. 611–614)
**Frontotemporal lobar degeneration** (DSM-5, pp. 614–618)
**Lewy body disease** (DSM-5, pp. 618–621)

**Another medical condition** (DSM-5, pp. 641–642)
**Multiple etiologies** (DSM-5, pp. 642–643)
**Unspecified** (DSM-5, p. 643)

**Coding note:** Code based on medical or substance etiology. In some cases, there is
need for an additional code for the etiological medical condition, which must immedi-

Criterion A

The DSM-5 wording focuses on “decline” from a previous level of performance, rather
than “deficit” as in DSM-IV. The DSM-IV criteria for dementia used Alzheimer ’s disease
as the prototype and thus required memory impairment for all dementias. There is
growing recognition that in many of the neurocognitive disorders (e.g., those related
to HIV infection, cerebrovascular disease, frontotemporal degeneration, traumatic
brain injury), other domains such as language or executive functions may be impaired
first, or exclusively, depending on the part of the brain affected and the natural his-
tory of the disease. The new definition also focuses first on performance rather than
disability. The criterion encourages the use of objective measures, including formal
neuropsychological testing where feasible, with less exclusive reliance on individual
judgment. Observation of decline and objective assessment are both included to en-
sure specificity. Although this evidence is more critical for diagnosing mild neurocog-
nitive disorder, similar statements are included for major neurocognitive disorder for
parallel structure of Criterion A.

Criterion B

The DSM-5 language preserves the traditional function-based threshold for dementia
but tries to operationalize it more clearly as a loss of independence.

Criteria C and D

The cognitive decline seen in major neurocognitive disorder affects some of the same
cognitive domains as seen in delirium. Although it is clinically important to distin-
guish major neurocognitive disorder from delirium, the two may co-occur.
The cognitive deficits in major neurocognitive disorder are not better explained by
another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia).

Subtypes and Specifiers

Subtypes and specifiers for major neurocognitive disorder are discussed under “Mild
Neurocognitive Disorder” below.


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **371**

Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

The mild neurocognitive disorder diagnosis is new and recognizes the substantial clin-
ical needs of individuals who have mild cognitive deficits in one or more of the same
domains as in major neurocognitive disorder but who can function independently
(i.e., have intact instrumental activities of daily living) (Petersen and O’Brien 2006).
Known in many settings as _mild cognitive impairment,_ the disorder can be a focus of
early intervention. This may enable the use of treatments that are ineffective at more
severe levels of impairment and/or neuronal damage. In DSM-IV, mild cognitive dis-
order was subsumed under the category cognitive disorder not otherwise specified.
Examples of mild neurocognitive disorder are the prevalent neurocognitive disorders
associated with such conditions as traumatic brain injury, HIV infection, substance use–
related brain disorders, and early or mild stages of cerebrovascular disease or neurode-
generative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Because these conditions are increas-
ingly being seen in clinical practice, clinicians have a need for reliable diagnostic criteria
to assess their patients and provide services—tasks that include treatment of associated
mood symptoms, further investigation of brain function, identification of treatable
causes, and, for progressive disorders, selection of appropriate early interventions.

Diagnostic Criteria for Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

A. Evidence of modest cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one
or more cognitive domains (complex attention, executive function, learning and
memory, language, perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on:

1. Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician that there
    has been a mild decline in cognitive function; and
2. A modest impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by
    standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another quantified
    clinical assessment.
B. The cognitive deficits do not interfere with capacity for independence in everyday
activities (i.e., complex instrumental activities of daily living such as paying bills or
managing medications are preserved, but greater effort, compensatory strategies,
or accommodation may be required).
C. The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of a delirium.
D. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.,
major depressive disorder, schizophrenia).

**Coding note:** For mild neurocognitive disorder due to any of the medical etiologies

ological medical conditions. For substance/medication-induced mild neurocognitive
disorder, code based on type of substance; see “Substance/Medication-Induced Ma-
jor or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder.” For unspecified mild neurocognitive disorder,
code **799.59 (R41.9).**

Specify:
**Without behavioral disturbance:** If the cognitive disturbance is not accompanied
by any clinically significant behavioral disturbance.
**With behavioral disturbance** (specify disturbance): If the cognitive disturbance
is accompanied by a clinically significant behavioral disturbance (e.g., psychotic
symptoms, mood disturbance, agitation, apathy, or other behavioral symptoms).

Criterion A

The combination of symptoms and objective assessment is critical in mild neurocog-
nitive disorder to maintain specificity. A report of a change in an individual’s abilities
protects against overdiagnosing the disorder in those with lifelong poor performance,
whereas objective assessment protects against overdiagnosing the disorder among
the “worried well.”

Criterion B

Mild neurocognitive disorder is the diagnosis for people who are still independent but
who must exert greater effort to carry out tasks or must use compensatory strategies.

Criteria C and D

The cognitive decline seen in mild neurocognitive disorder affects some of the same
cognitive domains as seen in delirium. Although it is clinically important to distinguish
mild neurocognitive disorder from delirium, the two may co-occur.
The cognitive deficits in mild neurocognitive disorder are not better explained by
another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia).

Subtypes and Specifiers for Both Major and

Mild Neurocognitive Disorders

Both major and mild neurocognitive disorders list subtypes by which the clinician can
code the proposed etiology of the disorder. All of the following subtypes require that the
diagnostic criteria for either mild or major neurocognitive disorder be met. The individ-
ual disorders are then differentiated on the basis of their etiology. In addition to the etio-


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **373**

logical subtypes (detailed below), major and mild neurocognitive disorders may be
further delineated by the specifier “with behavioral disturbance” or “without behavioral
disturbance” (e.g., psychotic symptoms, mood disturbance, agitation, apathy, or other be-
havioral symptoms). For major neurocognitive disorder, there are additional severity
specifiers to document the functional effects of the neurocognitive disorder: “mild,” re-
flecting difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., housework, managing
money); “moderate,” reflecting difficulties with basic activities of daily living (e.g., feed-
ing, dressing); and “severe,” meaning the individual is fully dependent.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that typically occurs in late life but
can occur earlier. It is marked by insidious onset, gradual decline, and typically an early
prominent memory loss. Alzheimer’s disease is also the most common cause of neuro-
cognitive disorder. Because of the modest predictive value of the clinical picture alone
and the significant social consequences of an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, the mild variant of
Alzheimer’s disease subtype is not commonly diagnosed. Individuals seen in memory
disorder clinics whose presentations meet criteria for mild neurocognitive disorder prog-
ress to dementia of the Alzheimer type at the rate of 12%–15% per year, while population-
based studies show a much lower rate of progression. Research is ongoing into what spe-
cific features of mild neurocognitive disorder might reliably indicate the presence of pro-
dromal Alzheimer ’s disease. The diagnosis of the Alzheimer’s specifier must be made on
clinical grounds in the absence of brain biopsy. Alzheimer’s disease has a characteristic
pattern of onset and progression of cognitive impairments.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive
Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment in one or more cogni-
tive domains (for major neurocognitive disorder, at least two domains must be im-
paired).
C. Criteria are met for either probable or possible Alzheimer’s disease as follows:

```
For major neurocognitive disorder:
Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if either of the following is present;
otherwise, possible Alzheimer’s disease should be diagnosed.
```
1. Evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from family his-
    tory or genetic testing.
2. All three of the following are present:
    a. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning and at least one other cog-
       nitive domain (based on detailed history or serial neuropsychological testing).


**374** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
b. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended pla-
teaus.
c. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative or
cerebrovascular disease, or another neurological, mental, or systemic dis-
ease or condition likely contributing to cognitive decline).
For mild neurocognitive disorder:
Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if there is evidence of a causative
Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from either genetic testing or family history.
Possible Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a causative
Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from either genetic testing or family history,
and all three of the following are present:
```
1. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning.
2. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended plateaus.
3. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative or
    cerebrovascular disease, or another neurological or systemic disease or con-
    dition likely contributing to cognitive decline).

D. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neu-
rodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurologi-
cal, or systemic disorder.

**Coding note:** For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease,
with behavioral disturbance, code first **331.0 (G30.9)** Alzheimer’s disease, followed by

Major or Mild Frontotemporal

Neurocognitive Disorder

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration has been found to be an important cause of neu-
rocognitive disorders. Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is characterized by
behavioral and personality changes and language impairment. In fact, DSM-5 recog-
nizes both a behavioral (e.g., apathy, stereotyped behaviors) and a language (e.g.,
word finding) variant. Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder can be difficult to dis-
tinguish from primary psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder),
and including them in the differential diagnosis will be helpful. Neuroimaging (e.g.,


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **375**

atrophy in frontotemporal regions) and genetics (e.g., mutations in the gene coding
for microtubule-associated protein tau) will be particularly useful in documenting
anomalies in frontal and temporal regions.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal
Neurocognitive Disorder

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression.
C. Either (1) or (2):

1. Behavioral variant:
    a. Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms:
       i. Behavioral disinhibition.
ii. Apathy or inertia.
iii. Loss of sympathy or empathy.
iv. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior.
v. Hyperorality and dietary changes.
    b. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities.
2. Language variant:
    a. Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production,
       word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension.

D. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function.
E. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neu-
rodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurologi-
cal, or systemic disorder.

**Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if either of the fol-
lowing is present; otherwise, **possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder**
should be diagnosed:

1. Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation,
    from either family history or genetic testing.
2. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuro-
    imaging.

**Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if there is no evi-
dence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed.

**Coding note:** For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar
degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first **331.19 (G31.09)** frontotemporal
disease, followed by **294.11 (F02.81)** probable major neurocognitive disorder due to
frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major
neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral
disturbance, code first **331.19 (G31.09)** frontotemporal disease, followed by **294.10

Major or Mild Neurocognitive

Disorder With Lewy Bodies

Lewy body disease is now recognized as the second most common degenerative de-
mentia of older adults. The First International Consortium on Dementia With Lewy
Bodies published consensus clinical and pathological criteria (McKeith et al. 1996).
The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are based on the third and most recent criteria (McKeith
2006). Prominent visual hallucinations and parkinsonian features tend to occur early
in the illness. The course is often slightly more rapid than that in Alzheimer’s disease.
Individuals with this form of neurocognitive disorder are very sensitive to the extra-
pyramidal side effects of conventional antipsychotics.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive
Disorder With Lewy Bodies

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. The disorder has an insidious onset and gradual progression.
C. The disorder meets a combination of core diagnostic features and suggestive di-
agnostic features for either probable or possible neurocognitive disorder with Lewy
bodies.
**For probable major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies,** the in-
dividual has two core features, or one suggestive feature with one or more core
features. For **possible major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bod-
ies,** the individual has only one core feature, or one or more suggestive features.

1. Core diagnostic features:
    a. Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness.
    b. Recurrent visual hallucinations that are well formed and detailed.
    c. Spontaneous features of parkinsonism, with onset subsequent to the devel-
       opment of cognitive decline.
2. Suggestive diagnostic features:
    a. Meets criteria for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.
    b. Severe neuroleptic sensitivity.

D. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neu-
rodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurologi-
cal, or systemic disorder.


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **377**

**Coding note:** For probable major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, with be-
havioral disturbance, code first **331.82 (G31.83)** Lewy body disease, followed by
**294.11 (F02.81)** probable major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, with be-

Major or Mild Vascular

Neurocognitive Disorder

The concept of vascular dementia has changed since the publication of DSM-IV. The
former concept of multi-infarct dementia (i.e., DSM-IV vascular dementia) has been
replaced by a much broader concept of dementia attributed to both small and large
vessel disease. Assessment of cerebrovascular disease relies on history, physical ex-
amination, and neuroimaging. The new criteria are consistent with those of the other
neurocognitive disorders as well as with the prevailing view among experts in this
field that cognitive disorders caused by vascular disease lie on a continuum.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive
Disorder

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. The clinical features are consistent with a vascular etiology, as suggested by ei-
ther of the following:

1. Onset of the cognitive deficits is temporally related to one or more cerebrovas-
    cular events.
2. Evidence for decline is prominent in complex attention (including processing
    speed) and frontal-executive function.

C. There is evidence of the presence of cerebrovascular disease from history, phys-
ical examination, and/or neuroimaging considered sufficient to account for the
neurocognitive deficits.
D. The symptoms are not better explained by another brain disease or systemic dis-
order.

**Probable vascular neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if one of the following is pres-
ent; otherwise **possible vascular neurocognitive disorder** should be diagnosed:


**378** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. Clinical criteria are supported by neuroimaging evidence of significant parenchy-
    mal injury attributed to cerebrovascular disease (neuroimaging-supported).
2. The neurocognitive syndrome is temporally related to one or more documented
    cerebrovascular events.
3. Both clinical and genetic (e.g., cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with sub-
    cortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) evidence of cerebrovascular disease is
    present.

**Possible vascular neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if the clinical criteria are
met but neuroimaging is not available and the temporal relationship of the neurocog-
nitive syndrome with one or more cerebrovascular events is not established.

**Coding note:** For probable major vascular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral
disturbance, code **290.40 (F01.51).** For probable major vascular neurocognitive disor-
der, without behavioral disturbance, code **290.40 (F01.50).** For possible major vascular
neurocognitive disorder, with or without behavioral disturbance, code **331.9 (G31.9).** An
additional medical code for the cerebrovascular disease is not needed.

For mild vascular neurocognitive disorder, code **331.83 (G31.84).** ( **Note:** Do not use
an additional code for the vascular disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but
should still be indicated in writing.)

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to

Traumatic Brain Injury

Neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury is caused by an impact to the
head or with rapid movement or brain displacement within the skull. The clinical
characteristics of the disorder depend on the location, severity, and duration of the
trauma. This diagnosis may be difficult in individuals with alcohol use disorders be-
cause such individuals are at increased risk both for repeated head injuries and for
substance-induced neurocognitive disorder. Posttraumatic stress may co-occur with the
disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive
Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is evidence of a traumatic brain injury—that is, an impact to the head or
other mechanisms of rapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull,
with one or more of the following:

1. Loss of consciousness.
2. Posttraumatic amnesia.
3. Disorientation and confusion.
4. Neurological signs (e.g., neuroimaging demonstrating injury; a new onset of
    seizures; a marked worsening of a preexisting seizure disorder; visual field
    cuts; anosmia; hemiparesis).


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **379**

C. The neurocognitive disorder presents immediately after the occurrence of the trau-
matic brain injury or immediately after recovery of consciousness and persists past
the acute post-injury period.

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with
behavioral disturbance: For ICD-9-CM, first code **907.0** late effect of intracranial injury
without skull fracture, followed by **294.11** major neurocognitive disorder due to trau-
matic brain injury, with behavioral disturbance. For ICD-10-CM, first code **S06.2X9S**
diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, se-
quela; followed by **F02.81** major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury,
with behavioral disturbance.

For major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, without behavioral dis-
turbance: For ICD-9-CM, first code **907.0** late effect of intracranial injury without skull
fracture, followed by **294.10** major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury,
without behavioral disturbance. For ICD-10-CM, first code **S06.2X9S** diffuse traumatic
brain injury with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, sequela; followed by
**F02.80** major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, without behavioral
disturbance.

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, code **331.83 (G31.84).**
( **Note:** Do not use the additional code for traumatic brain injury. Behavioral distur-
bance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Substance/Medication-Induced Major or

Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Substance/medication-induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder needs to be
distinguished from the cognitive impairments commonly seen with substance intox-
ication or withdrawal. The impairments seen in intoxication or withdrawal are usu-
ally reversible, whereas substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder is a
persisting condition. This disorder results from the neurotoxic effects of a substance
or medication, and the deficits are usually permanent. This disorder is more common
in older individuals, with longer use of drugs or alcohol, and with other risk factors
such as nutritional deficits.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced Major or
Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. The neurocognitive impairments do not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium and persist beyond the usual duration of intoxication and acute with-
drawal.
C. The involved substance or medication and duration and extent of use are capable
of producing the neurocognitive impairment.


**380** DSM-5 Guidebook

D. The temporal course of the neurocognitive deficits is consistent with the timing of
substance or medication use and abstinence (e.g., the deficits remain stable or im-
prove after a period of abstinence).
E. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition or is
not better explained by another mental disorder.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medi-
cation]-induced neurocognitive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with
the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the
clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced
neurocognitive disorder (e.g., “mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major
neurocognitive disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and
the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance]
use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there
is no comorbid substance use disorder, then the 4th position character is “9,” and the
clinician should record only the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder. For some
classes of substances (i.e., alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics), it is not permissi-
ble to code a comorbid mild substance use disorder with a substance-induced neuro-
cognitive disorder; only a comorbid moderate or severe substance use disorder, or no
substance use disorder, can be diagnosed. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but
should still be indicated in writing.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to HIV Infection

Individuals with HIV infection are at increased risk of developing a neurocognitive
disorder. The disorder could be due to any number of associated diseases, such as
toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, cryptococcosis, central nervous system lymphoma,
or tuberculosis. This diagnosis should be given only when cognitive impairment is
judged to be due to the direct central nervous system effects of HIV. This disorder is
more common in individuals with prior episodes of severe immunosuppression,
those with high viral loads in the cerebrospinal fluid, and those with HIV-related ane-
mia or hypoalbuminemia.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Prion Disease

Neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease is rare, and the most common type is
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The disease is accompanied by ataxia, myoclonus, chorea,
and dystonia. The course is typically rapidly progressive over as little as 6 months.
The diagnosis is confirmed with brain biopsy or autopsy.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Parkinson’s Disease

The essential feature of this disorder is cognitive decline after the onset of Parkinson’s
disease. As many as 75% of individuals with Parkinson’s disease will develop a major
neurocognitive disorder, and 27% will have a mild neurocognitive disorder. Individ-
uals who are older at disease onset and those with increasing duration of disease ap-
pear more likely to develop a neurocognitive disorder.

Disorder Due to Parkinson’s Disease

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. The disturbance occurs in the setting of established Parkinson’s disease.
C. There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment.
D. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition and is
not better explained by another mental disorder.

**Major or mild neurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson’s disease**
should be diagnosed if 1 and 2 are both met. **Major or mild neurocognitive disorder
possibly due to Parkinson’s disease** should be diagnosed if 1 or 2 is met:

1. There is no evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative
    or cerebrovascular disease or another neurological, mental, or systemic disease
    or condition likely contributing to cognitive decline).
2. The Parkinson’s disease clearly precedes the onset of the neurocognitive disorder.

For major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, without behavioral distur-
bance, code first **333.4 (G10)** Huntington’s disease, followed by **294.10 (F02.80)** major
neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, without behavioral disturbance.

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, code **331.83 (G31.84).**
( **Note:** Do not use the additional code for Huntington’s disease. Behavioral disturbance
cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

The diagnosis neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition is used when
an individual has a cause other than those listed specifically in DSM-5. Potential causes
include brain tumors, subdural hematomas, multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis, hypo-
glycemia, renal or hepatic failure, childhood and adult storage diseases, and vitamin
deficiencies.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder
Due to Another Medical Condition

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings


**_Neurocognitive Disorders_** **385**

that the neurocognitive disorder is the pathophysiological consequence of another
medical condition.
C. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder or an-
other specific neurocognitive disorder (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, HIV infection).

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition,
with behavioral disturbance, code first the other medical condition, followed by the major
neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, with behavioral disturbance
(e.g., 340 [G35] multiple sclerosis, **294.11 [F02.81]** major neurocognitive disorder due
to multiple sclerosis, with behavioral disturbance). For major neurocognitive disorder
due to another medical condition, without behavioral disturbance, code first the other
medical condition, followed by the major neurocognitive disorder due to another med-
ical condition, without behavioral disturbance (e.g., 340 [G35] multiple sclerosis,
**294.10 [F02.80]** major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple sclerosis, without be-
havioral disturbance).

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, code **331.83
(G31.84).** ( **Note:** Do not use the additional code for the other medical condition. Be-
havioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Multiple Etiologies

If a major or mild neurocognitive disorder is of mixed etiology (e.g., Alzheimer’s dis-
ease and cerebrovascular disease) and the multiple underlying diseases are known, the
multiple etiological subtypes should all be diagnosed.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder
Due to Multiple Etiologies

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
the neurocognitive disorder is the pathophysiological consequence of more than
one etiological process, excluding substances (e.g., neurocognitive disorder due
to Alzheimer’s disease with subsequent development of vascular neurocognitive
disorder).
**Note:** Please refer to the diagnostic criteria for the various neurocognitive disor-
ders due to specific medical conditions for guidance on establishing the particular
etiologies.
C. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder and do
not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with be-
havioral disturbance, code **294.11 (F02.81)** ; for major neurocognitive disorder due to
multiple etiologies, without behavioral disturbance, code **294.10 (F02.80).** All of the eti-
ological medical conditions (with the exception of vascular disease) should be coded


**386** DSM-5 Guidebook

and listed separately immediately before major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple
etiologies (e.g., **331.0 [G30.9]** Alzheimer’s disease; **331.82 [G31.83]** Lewy body dis-
ease; **294.11 [F02.81]** major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with be-
havioral disturbance).

When a cerebrovascular etiology is contributing to the neurocognitive disorder, the di-
agnosis of vascular neurocognitive disorder should be listed in addition to major neuro-
cognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies. For example, for a presentation of major
neurocognitive disorder due to both Alzheimer’s disease and vascular disease, with
behavioral disturbance, code the following: **331.0 (G30.9)** Alzheimer’s disease; **294.11
(F02.81)** major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with behavioral dis-
turbance; **290.40 (F01.51)** major vascular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral dis-
turbance.

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, code **331.83 (G31.84).**
( **Note:** Do not use the additional codes for the etiologies. Behavioral disturbance can-
not be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder

Neurocognitive disorders may be diagnosed as unspecified when there are symptoms
of a neurocognitive disorder that cause distress or impairment but do not meet full cri-
teria for any disorder in this diagnostic class. This diagnosis is used when the precise
etiology cannot be determined.

Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder 799.59 ( **R41.9** )

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurocog-
nitive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The un-
specified neurocognitive disorder category is used in situations in which the precise eti-
ology cannot be determined with sufficient certainty to make an etiological attribution.

**Coding note:** For unspecified major or mild neurocognitive disorder, code 799.59
(R41.9). ( **Note:** Do not use additional codes for any presumed etiological medical con-
ditions. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but may be indicated in writing.)

KEY POINTS

- Called “delirium, dementia, and amnestic and other cognitive disorders” in
    DSM-IV, the diagnostic class has been renamed “neurocognitive disorders.”
- DSM-5 recognizes both major neurocognitive disorders and a less severe level
    of cognitive impairment, referred to as mild neurocognitive disorder. The latter
    term is used for less disabling syndromes that may be a focus of concern.
- Examples of symptoms and assessments of the various neurocognitive do-
    mains (e.g., complex attention, executive function) are provided at both major
    and mild levels of impairment.
- Clinicians who diagnose either a major or mild neurocognitive disorder can spec-
    ify an etiologic subtype (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease).
