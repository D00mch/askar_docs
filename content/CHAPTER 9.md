## Dissociative disorders retain an important role in DSM-5,

whose metastructure recognizes that dissociative symptoms are a feature of disorders
in other diagnostic classes in the manual. For that reason, the placement of dissocia-
tive disorders between the trauma- and stressor-related disorders and the somatic
symptom and related disorders is meant to reflect the close relationship among these
categories. Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder include dissocia-
tive symptoms, such as amnesia, flashbacks, and numbing. The somatic symptom
and related disorders also include syndromes involving interference with sensory and
motor function that are dissociative in nature, such as pseudoseizures and other pseu-
doneurological symptoms.
Dissociative states have a long and rich history, their hallmark being a disruption of
and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of conscience, memory, identity, emotion,
perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior. They were first formally
recognized in DSM-I as “dissociative reaction.” DSM-II included the diagnosis “hysteri-
cal neurosis, dissociative type” as one of two neuroses (the other was “hysterical neuro-
sis, conversion type”). According to DSM-II, “In the dissociative type, alterations may
occur in the patient’s state of consciousness or in his identity, to produce such symptoms
as amnesia, somnambulism, fugue, and multiple personality” (p. 40).
Dissociative disorders were accorded a separate class in DSM-III, which included
diagnostic criteria for the many forms of dissociation and depersonalization that had
been described, including multiple personality disorder (renamed “dissociative iden-
tity disorder” in DSM-IV).
Some believe that dissociative disorders are rare, but research suggests they are
relatively common, particularly in hospital and clinic settings (Foote et al. 2006; Sar et
al. 2007). Subclinical forms of dissociation are frequent in the general population and


**192** DSM-5 Guidebook

are not inherently maladaptive (e.g., daydreaming). Experiences of pathological pos-
session and other forms of identity disruption may be even more common in non-
Western cultures. They are frequently found in the aftermath of trauma, and many of the
symptoms are hidden or confusing to individuals, making careful diagnostic evalua-
tion important.
Dissociative disorders cause substantial distress and disability and can disrupt
every important area of psychological function. Symptoms can be experienced as un-
wanted intrusions into awareness and behavior with accompanying loss of continu-
ity in subjective experience, or as an inability to access information or control mental
functions that are normally readily amenable to access or control.
There are several important changes in the dissociative disorders in DSM-5 (Spie-
gel et al. 2011). First, _derealization_ —the feeling of estrangement or detachment from
one’s environment—has been merged with depersonalization in depersonalization/
derealization disorder. This replaces DSM-IV’s depersonalization disorder. The change
is an acknowledgment of the importance of these symptoms and recognizes that they
often co-occur. Research evidence shows that people with prominent derealization
alone do not differ in any important respect from those with depersonalization accom-
panied by derealization.
Next, dissociative fugue is now a specifier for dissociative amnesia rather than an
independent disorder, as in DSM-IV. The criteria for dissociative identity disorder
have been changed to indicate that disruption of identity and conscience may be re-
ported by the individual as well as observed by others, and that the accompanying
amnesia can be for everyday events and for important personal information, not just
for traumatic events.
The dissociative disorders are mutually exclusive and are presented hierarchi-
cally. When present, dissociative identity disorder takes precedence over dissociative
amnesia and depersonalization/derealization disorder. The categories other speci-
fied dissociative disorder and unspecified dissociative disorder can be used for dis-
sociative symptoms that do not meet more specific criteria. Table 9–1 lists the DSM-5
dissociative disorders.

Dissociative Identity Disorder

Described for centuries and first recognized in DSM-III as “multiple personality disor-
der,” dissociative identity disorder is defined in DSM-5 as requiring two or more fully
distinct personality states, which in some cultures may be described as an experience of


**_Dissociative Disorders_** **193**

possession. The disorder is reported to begin in childhood and has been attributed to
adaptation to overwhelming circumstances, such as physical or sexual abuse.
Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may first present with symptoms
of emotional and behavioral turmoil. Some may notice memory gaps and incidents of
out-of-character behavior. These symptoms result from different “alters,” or alternate
identities, controlling an individual’s behavior for varying lengths of time. Switches have
been observed with stressful situations, disputes among alters, and other psycholog-
ical conflicts.

Diagnostic Criteria for Dissociative
Identity Disorder **300.14 (F44.81)**

A. Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states,
which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The dis-
ruption in identity involves marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agen-
cy, accompanied by related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory,
perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symp-
toms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.
B. Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information,
and/or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.
C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious
practice.
**Note:** In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary playmates
or other fantasy play.
E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical con-
dition (e.g., complex partial seizures).

Criterion A

This criterion has been revised to be more specific with regard to how the disorder
disturbs the person’s functioning. The language was changed to acknowledge a
marked discontinuity in the sense of self and sense of agency. DSM-IV required two
or more distinct “identities or personality states,” but the distinction between “iden-
tities” and “personality states” was never clear, nor was it clear that switches had to
represent a break with the person’s usual thinking and behavior. These changes may
be observed by others or reported by the individual (in DSM-IV this was unstated).
The concept of _possession_ appears as well (it wasn’t specified in DSM-IV).

Criterion B

In DSM-IV Criterion C, memory gaps were described as involving “important personal
information.” More guidance is given to clinicians in DSM-5 with regard to memory
lapses, in that they are described as affecting recall of “everyday events, important per-


**194** DSM-5 Guidebook

sonal information, and/or traumatic events.” Clearly, with dissociative identity disorder,
memory gaps tend to occur when one or more of the alters take control of the person’s
executive function, and the individual reports “losing time.” The quality and extent of the
memory loss are not consistent with ordinary forgetting. For example, the person may re-
port that he or she is unable to recall the past 2 days despite having excellent recall of
events immediately preceding and following the period of amnesia.

Criterion C

This criterion, new to DSM-5, recognizes that dissociative identity disorder causes
clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning in important life domains.
Symptoms are consciously experienced and are often quite disturbing to the person,
reflecting an alter’s intrusion into the person’s conscious functioning. When this oc-
curs, the person’s sense of self is disrupted. The person’s sense of directing his or her
speech and actions may be lost, and voices may intrude into the conscious mind; strong
emotions and impulses may emerge suddenly. People may become depersonalized
observers of their actions, which they may feel powerless to stop. The person’s body
may suddenly feel very different—for example, like that of a small child or an individ-
ual of the opposite gender—and all of these alterations in sense of self and this loss of
personal agency may be accompanied by feelings that the person recognizes are “not
mine.” These changes can be highly distressing, and for many people these symp-
toms will adversely affect relationships, marriages, parenting function, and one’s oc-
cupational and professional life.

Criterion D

This criterion recognizes that cultural and religious practices that include or even cel-
ebrate dissociation must be excluded as explanations for the disorder. Some indigenous
societies believe in the concept of _spirit possession._ These beliefs are not uncommon in
the developing world and non-Western societies, but they may also be found in cer-
tain religious groups in the United States and elsewhere. In these situations, alters may
present as spirits, demons, animals, or mythical figures.

Criterion E

This criterion recognizes that substances of abuse or a medical condition could be as-
sociated with dissociation and therefore must be ruled out. For example, hallucinogens
and phencyclidine (PCP) can induce dissociative-like experiences. Brain tumors or
seizure disorders (e.g., complex partial seizures) have been known to cause dissocia-
tive states. These conditions must be ruled out as part of a medical evaluation.

Dissociative Amnesia

Dissociative amnesia is characterized by the inability to recall important autobiograph-
ical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is considered too exten-
sive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. With dissociative amnesia, the person is


**_Dissociative Disorders_** **195**

typically confused and perplexed and may not recall significant personal information or
even his or her own name. The amnesia typically develops suddenly and can last from
minutes to days, or even longer. Most cases last less than 1 week. In DSM-5, two primary
forms are listed: 1) _localized_ or _selective_ amnesia for specific event(s) and 2) _generalized_ am-
nesia for identity and life history. Although some individuals with amnesia notice that
they have “lost time” or that they have a gap in their memory, most people with disso-
ciative disorders are initially unaware of their amnesias.
A major change in DSM-5 is that dissociative fugue is now a specifier for dissocia-
tive amnesia, not a separate diagnosis as in DSM-IV. This change was prompted by
the fact that the disorder is uncommon, is rarely diagnosed, and typically occurs in
the context of an amnesic episode. The fugue usually involves sudden, unexpected
travel away from home or one’s workplace, and the associated amnesia is character-
ized by inability to recall one’s past and the assumption of a new identity that may be
partial or complete. Fugues can last for months and lead to a complicated pattern of
travel and identity formation.

Diagnostic Criteria for Dissociative Amnesia **300.12 (F44.0)**

A. An inability to recall important autobiographical information, usually of a traumatic
or stressful nature, that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.
**Note:** Dissociative amnesia most often consists of localized or selective amnesia
for a specific event or events; or generalized amnesia for identity and life history.
B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
alcohol or other drug of abuse, a medication) or a neurological or other medical
condition (e.g., partial complex seizures, transient global amnesia, sequelae of a
closed head injury/traumatic brain injury, other neurological condition).
D. The disturbance is not better explained by dissociative identity disorder, posttrau-
matic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, somatic symptom disorder, or major
or mild neurocognitive disorder.

**Coding note:** The code for dissociative amnesia without dissociative fugue is **300.12
(F44.0).** The code for dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue is **300.13 (F44.1).**

Specify if:
**300.13 (F44.1) With dissociative fugue:** Apparently purposeful travel or bewil-
dered wandering that is associated with amnesia for identity or for other important
autobiographical information.

Criterion A

Dissociative amnesia primarily affects the ability to recall personal information about
oneself, and it may be selective for specific events or more global. Unlike in DSM-IV, the
criterion now specifies two types of amnesia: localized or selective, and generalized.


**196** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion B

The diagnosis requires clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning.
With this disorder, the person may feel that he or she is “going crazy” or may have con-
cerns about self-identity.

Criteria C and D

Amnesia must be distinguished from the effect of a substance or a neurological or other
medical condition that can induce amnesia. For example, individuals may experience
blackouts during periods of heavy alcohol use, and people who experience seizures
may be amnesic for varying periods of time prior to or following a seizure. Major neu-
rocognitive disorders can cause amnesia, but in these disorders the amnestic symp-
toms generally do not occur in isolation, and other symptoms typical of a dementia,
such as behavioral disturbance, will be present.
Dissociative amnesia must be distinguished from other mental disorders. This is
important because amnesia may be seen in other disorders, such as somatic symptom
disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. For example, a person with dissociative
identity disorder may experience amnesia when an alter takes control.

Specifier

The specifier “with dissociative fugue” is used when the person unexpectedly travels
away from home or the workplace, or wanders bewilderedly, during an episode of
dissociative amnesia.

Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

Depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by clinically significant per-
sistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization and/or derealization. Transient
depersonalization and derealization symptoms are very common. Research shows
that these symptoms comprise four or five factors: numbing, unreality of self, unreal-
ity of others, temporal disintegration, and perceptual alterations. There is no evidence
of any distinction between individuals with predominantly depersonalization or de-
realization symptoms. The disorder rarely begins after age 40 years and can become
chronic, resulting in significant distress and disability.

Diagnostic Criteria for Depersonalization/
Derealization Disorder **300.6 (F48.1)**

A. The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, dereal-
ization, or both:

1. **Depersonalization:** Experiences of unreality, detachment, or being an outside
    observer with respect to one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions
    (e.g., perceptual alterations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emo-
    tional and/or physical numbing).


**_Dissociative Disorders_** **197**

2. **Derealization:** Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect to sur-
    roundings (e.g., individuals or objects are experienced as unreal, dreamlike,
    foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted).

B. During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality testing remains intact.
C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, medication) or another medical condition (e.g., seizures).
E. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as
schizophrenia, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, acute stress disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder, or another dissociative disorder.

Criteria A, B, and C

Criterion A requires the presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonali-
zation and/or derealization. _Depersonalization_ involves feeling detached from oneself or
one’s surroundings, as though one were an outside observer (e.g., a “dreamlike” state).
A person may feel cut off from his or her thoughts, emotions, or identity. Another may
feel like a robot or automaton. _Derealization_ produces a sense of unreality or detach-
ment with respect to one’s surroundings.
Criterion B recognizes that despite the strange thoughts and sensations the person
is experiencing, he or she is not psychotic or out of touch with reality. Intact reality
testing excludes the possibility of a psychotic disorder.
The diagnosis requires the presence of distress or impairment in functioning (Cri-
terion C). The symptoms may be highly distressing; the affectively flattened and ro-
botic demeanor seen in some individuals may be incongruent with the extreme
emotional pain they report. Impairment is often experienced in both interpersonal
and occupational domains, largely due to the sense of hypoemotionality. Others may
experience subjective difficulty in focusing and retaining information, and feel a gen-
eral sense of disconnectedness from life.

Criteria D and E

Depersonalization and derealization can result from the use of substances (e.g., mar-
ijuana, hallucinogens) or from a medical condition (Criterion D). Presentation after
age 40 years should suggest the possibility of an underlying medical condition, such
as a seizure disorder, brain tumor, or stroke. Complex partial seizures are known to
induce depersonalization and derealization, but they are uncommon.
Depersonalization/derealization disorder needs to be distinguished from other
mental disorders associated with these symptoms (Criterion E). Individuals with
schizophrenia may experience depersonalization and derealization symptoms, but
these occur in the context of hallucinations and delusions. Some persons with major
depressive disorder experience feelings of numbness or feel emotionally dead inside,
but these feelings occur only during a mood episode. People with panic disorder can
experience these symptoms, but the symptoms occur during panic attacks and are not


**198** DSM-5 Guidebook

chronic. Depersonalization/derealization symptoms may occur in other dissociative
disorders, but in that case the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder
is preempted.

Other Specified Dissociative Disorder and

Unspecified Dissociative Disorder

The other specified and unspecified dissociative disorder diagnoses replace DSM-
IV’s category dissociative disorder not otherwise specified but serve a similar func-
tion as a residual category for dissociative symptoms that do not fit within a more
specific category.
Other specified dissociative disorder is used when symptoms characteristic of a
dissociative disorder are present and cause distress or impairment but do not meet
the full criteria for a more specific disorder in the class. The category is used when the
clinician chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet full
criteria. The clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., chronic or re-
current syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms).
The category unspecified dissociative disorder is used when the individual’s symp-
toms do not meet full criteria for a more specific disorder that causes distress or im-
pairment, and the clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met,
or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Dissociative Disorder **300.15 (F44.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissocia-
tive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for any specific dissociative disorder. This is done by recording “other specified
dissociative disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “dissociative trance”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms:** This cat-
    egory includes identity disturbance associated with less-than-marked discontinui-
    ties in sense of self and agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of possession
    in an individual who reports no dissociative amnesia.
2. **Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion:** Indi-
    viduals who have been subjected to intense coercive persuasion (e.g., brainwashing,
    thought reform, indoctrination while captive, torture, long-term political imprison-
    ment, recruitment by sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with pro-
    longed changes in, or conscious questioning of, their identity.


**_Dissociative Disorders_** **199**

3. **Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events:** This category is for acute,
    transient conditions that typically last less than 1 month, and sometimes only a few
    hours or days. These conditions are characterized by constriction of conscious-
    ness; depersonalization; derealization; perceptual disturbances (e.g., time slow-
    ing, macropsia); micro-amnesias; transient stupor; and/or alterations in sensory-
    motor functioning (e.g., analgesia, paralysis).
4. **Dissociative trance:** This condition is characterized by an acute narrowing or
    complete loss of awareness of immediate surroundings that manifests as profound
    unresponsiveness or insensitivity to environmental stimuli. The unresponsiveness
    may be accompanied by minor stereotyped behaviors (e.g., finger movements) of
    which the individual is unaware and/or that he or she cannot control, as well as
    transient paralysis or loss of consciousness. The dissociative trance is not a nor-
    mal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.

Unspecified Dissociative Disorder **300.15 (F44.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissocia-
tive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation-
al, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria
for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific dissociative disorder, and
includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- The criteria for dissociative identity disorder have been changed to indicate that
    disruption of identity and conscience may be reported by the individual as well
    as observed, and that the accompanying amnesia can involve everyday events
    and important personal information, as well as traumatic events.
- Dissociative fugue is now a specifier for dissociative amnesia, rather than an
    independent disorder as in DSM-IV.
- Depersonalization/derealization disorder is new to DSM-5 and, by merging de-
    realization with depersonalization, acknowledges that these symptoms often
    co-occur.
