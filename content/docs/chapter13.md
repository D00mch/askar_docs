**240** DSM-5 Guidebook

Dysfunction in sleep or waking is among the most common rea-
sons people seek health care. The maintenance of a normal cycle of sleep and wake-
fulness is an important component of successful adaptation across the life cycle
because robust circadian rhythms help regulate mood and enhance cognitive perfor-
mance. Problems with sleep, sleep quality, and daytime alertness have enormous im-
pact on quality of life and level of functioning.
The four stages of sleep include rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and three stages
of non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Stage 1 NREM sleep is characterized by
the disappearance of alpha waves and the appearance of theta waves on the electro-
encephalogram (EEG). Hypnic jerks are common in this stage. In stage 2 NREM sleep,
sleep spindles and K-complexes are found on the EEG. Previously separated into two
stages, stage 3 NREM sleep is _slow-wave sleep,_ or deep sleep. Delta waves are seen on
the EEG. Dreaming is more common in this stage than in other stages of NREM sleep
but not as common as in REM sleep. REM sleep is characterized by rapid eye move-
ment, low muscle tone, and rapid, low-voltage electroencephalographic activity. REM
sleep alternates with periods of NREM sleep approximately every 90 minutes; in
adults, REM sleep typically occupies 20%–25% of total sleep. During a normal night’s
sleep, most adults experience four to five periods of REM sleep. The REM episodes
increase in duration during the night. The relative amount of REM sleep varies with
age, with older age associated with less efficient sleep and less time spent in REM
sleep.
Dysfunction in any of these sleep stages may result in a sleep-wake disorder. DSM
has long recognized sleep disorders in some fashion. Somnambulism, or sleepwalk-
ing disorder, was the first sleep-wake disorder included in DSM-I. The disorder name
was changed to disorder of sleep in DSM-II. DSM-III included both sleepwalking dis-
order and sleep terror disorder, but they were placed with the “Disorders Usually
First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.” A stand-alone chapter was
developed for DSM-III-R and included the variety of disorders that are now recog-
nized as sleep disorders. Several disorders were added to DSM-IV, such as narcolepsy
and breathing-related sleep disorder.
DSM-5 recognizes 12 specific sleep-wake disorders as well as several other speci-
fied and unspecified disorders (Table 13–1). The chapter revision has been influenced
by the second edition of the _International Classification of Sleep Disorders_ (ICSD-2), pub-
lished by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2005). The ICSD-2 contains over
70 specific sleep-wake diagnoses grouped into eight categories: insomnia, breathing-
related sleep disorders, hypersomnias of central origin, circadian rhythm sleep disor-
ders, parasomnias, sleep-related movement disorders, isolated symptoms and normal
variants, and other sleep disorders. Although DSM-5 has not incorporated as many
diagnoses as are contained in the ICSD-2, the current diagnoses are compatible with
them.
The revisions in DSM-5 present a clinically useful approach to diagnosis. In DSM-
IV, sleep disorders required the clinician to determine if the sleeping problem was a
primary issue or a consequence of another problem. In DSM-5, use of the term _primary_
has been dropped in favor of simply listing insomnia disorder if diagnostic criteria are
met. Coexisting mental and physical disorders are listed, but without the use of terms

such as _related to_ or _due to,_ which were used in DSM-IV. Such terms imply a causal re-
lationship, which often cannot be established. By avoiding etiological assumptions,
the classification system reminds clinicians that insomnia disorder usually requires in-
dependent clinical attention in addition to management of coexisting mental and
physical disorders. The changes also recognize the bidirectional and interactive effects
between sleep disorders and coexisting medical and mental disorders.
The clinician confronted with complaints of sleep disturbance must define the na-
ture of the complaint, whether primarily insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, dis-
turbed mentation or behavior during sleep, or difficulties in the circadian placement
of sleep. The first step in diagnosis should be to consider the individual’s general
medical condition, to determine whether the complaint represents a sleep disorder at-


**242** DSM-5 Guidebook

tributable to another medical condition. Furthermore, if the individual is taking a
medication or using a substance, the clinician will need to consider the possibility of
a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder.
If the main complaint is persistent insomnia and/or difficulty initiating or main-
taining sleep, a diagnosis of insomnia disorder may be appropriate. If the primary
complaint is excessive sleepiness, the clinician should consider the differential diag-
nosis of a hypersomnolence disorder, narcolepsy, or one of the breathing-related sleep
disorders. If the individual frequently travels or is involved in shift work, or has a
problem of sleep timing, a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder should be consid-
ered. If the individual’s symptoms consist of predominantly behavioral or mental
events during sleep (e.g., abrupt awakening, frightening dreams, or walking about
while sleeping), the clinician should consider a diagnosis of an NREM sleep arousal
disorder.

Insomnia Disorder

_Insomnia,_ which is Latin for “no sleep,” involves the predominant complaint of an in-
ability to fall asleep or remain asleep. The word is also used to describe the condition
of waking up not feeling restored or refreshed. Insomnia is the most common sleep
complaint in the general population. It can be either acute (i.e., lasting one to several
nights) or chronic (i.e., persisting for 1 month or longer). According to the National
Center on Sleep Disorders Research at the National Institutes of Health, about 30%–40%
of adults say they have symptoms of insomnia within a given year, and about 10%–15%
of adults report chronic insomnia (National Institutes of Health 2005). Among individ-
uals reporting chronic insomnia, most have chronic or intermittent symptoms, meaning
that they experience difficulty sleeping for a few nights, followed by a few nights of
adequate sleep before the problem returns.
Among those who report insomnia, sleep maintenance insomnia is the most fre-
quent problem, followed by difficulty falling asleep and then early morning awaken-
ing. Complaints of poor sleep or insomnia increase with age, paralleling age-related
changes in sleep-stage physiology. Young people with insomnia more frequently re-
port difficulty falling asleep, whereas older individuals report middle and terminal
insomnia. Furthermore, women of all ages report more sleep problems than men. De-
spite the large number of people with insomnia complaints, relatively few seek med-
ical attention.
Insomnia can be a disorder in its own right or a symptom of another condition. Stress
and worry are frequently blamed for insomnia. Insomnia can also occur with jet lag,
shift work, and other major schedule changes. Research has consistently found a ro-
bust association between insomnia and psychiatric disorders—particularly depres-
sion and anxiety—across the life cycle. Persistent sleep disturbance was identified in
the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study as a highly significant risk factor for the
_subsequent_ development of major depressive disorder (Ford and Kamerow 1989).
Hence, early intervention to treat sleep disturbance might protect against depression.
Many changes have been made in the criteria for DSM-5 sleep-wake disorders.
Three DSM-IV disorders—primary insomnia, insomnia related to another mental dis-


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **243**

order, and sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, insomnia type—have
been merged into the single DSM-5 diagnostic entity of insomnia disorder. The change
moves away from the need to make causal attributions between co-occurring disor-
ders, and acknowledges the interactive effects between sleep disorders and co-occur-
ring medical or psychiatric conditions. Data show that in the majority of insomnia
cases, the individual presents with another psychiatric or medical disorder, as op-
posed to the insomnia being a disorder on its own (i.e., primary insomnia in DSM-IV).
Furthermore, the diagnostic reliability of insomnia, particularly primary insomnia,
was relatively poor. Distinguishing between primary insomnia and insomnia due to
a mental disorder or a medical condition was often difficult (or impossible), and the
construct of secondary insomnia often led to undertreatment. In eliminating the dis-
tinction between primary and secondary insomnia, DSM-5 emphasizes that sleep dis-
orders warrant independent clinical attention.

Diagnostic Criteria for Insomnia Disorder **307.42 (F51.01)**

A. A predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, associ-
ated with one (or more) of the following symptoms:

1. Difficulty initiating sleep. (In children, this may manifest as difficulty ini-
    tiating sleep without caregiver intervention.)
2. Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakenings or problems
    returning to sleep after awakenings. (In children, this may manifest as difficulty
    returning to sleep without caregiver intervention.)
3. Early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.

B. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other important areas of func-
tioning.
C. The sleep difficulty occurs at least 3 nights per week.
D. The sleep difficulty is present for at least 3 months.
E. The sleep difficulty occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep.
F. The insomnia is not better explained by and does not occur exclusively during the
course of another sleep-wake disorder (e.g., narcolepsy, a breathing-related sleep
disorder, a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, a parasomnia).
G. The insomnia is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication).
H. Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately explain the
predominant complaint of insomnia.

Specify if:
**With non–sleep disorder mental comorbidity,** including substance use disorders
**With other medical comorbidity
With other sleep disorder
Coding note:** The code 780.52 (G47.00) applies to all three specifiers. Code also the
relevant associated mental disorder, medical condition, or other sleep disorder imme-
diately after the code for insomnia disorder in order to indicate the association.


**244** DSM-5 Guidebook

Specify if:
**Episodic:** Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.
**Persistent:** Symptoms last 3 months or longer.
**Recurrent:** Two (or more) episodes within the space of 1 year.

**Note:** Acute and short-term insomnia (i.e., symptoms lasting less than 3 months but
otherwise meeting all criteria with regard to frequency, intensity, distress, and/or im-
pairment) should be coded as an other specified insomnia disorder.

Criterion A

DSM-5 has integrated the construct of sleep dissatisfaction into the definition of insom-
nia. Evidence suggests that the presence of sleep dissatisfaction in addition to insomnia
symptoms increases considerably the proportion of individuals with daytime impair-
ments relative to those with insomnia symptoms alone. Hence, adding sleep dissatis-
faction to the definition of insomnia is likely to improve diagnostic specificity. This
change could also improve detection of clinically significant insomnia among sub-
groups of individuals (e.g., older adults) who typically report little impairment or dis-
tress associated with insomnia symptoms but who are otherwise dissatisfied with their
sleep. Criterion A requires dissatisfaction with quantity or quality regarding initiating
sleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning awakenings. In addition, the criterion spe-
cifically highlights how these requirements may differ in children—that children may
manifest difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep without caregiver intervention.

Criterion B

This criterion lists specific examples of the distress or impairments in daytime func-
tioning resulting from insomnia. Many individuals with persistent insomnia (e.g.,
older adults) tend to minimize or underestimate the impact of insomnia on their day-
time functioning, partly due to the lack of clear indicators of such impairments. This is
likely to lead to underdiagnosis and absence of treatment. The addition of specific ex-
amples of impairments may enhance assessment and boost recognition of the impact of
insomnia on daytime functioning.

Criteria C and D

Criterion C requires that the sleep disturbance be present for at least 3 nights each week
(an addition in DSM-5). The minimum frequency criterion of 3 nights per week will dif-
ferentiate individuals with occasional (subthreshold) insomnia from those with more
clinically meaningful insomnia. Sensitivity and specificity indices are maximized (i.e.,
correct identification of true insomnia cases and correct exclusion of false positives), with
a frequency of occurrence of insomnia falling between 3 and 4 nights per week. Also, this
frequency criterion is consistent with that used in ICD-10 and with current research prac-
tices in the field. Evidence suggests that the frequency of occurrence of insomnia symp-
toms is an important determinant of morbidity and impairment.
The minimum duration of 3 months (Criterion D) reflects a change from the previ-
ous requirement of 1 month, which was a very short period to define insomnia as a


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **245**

chronic condition. By comparison, few psychiatric or medical conditions are considered
chronic before they exceed 6- or 12-month durations. Insomnia lasting only 1 month
might be better conceptualized as an _episode_ rather than a disorder. Morbidity may
also increase with insomnia persisting longer than 3 months.

Criterion E

This criterion requires that the sleep disturbance occur despite adequate opportunity
for sleep. This criterion was added to help distinguish clinical insomnia from voli-
tional sleep deprivation.

Criteria F, G, and H

These criteria are for ruling out other mental disorders and medical conditions. They
indicate that the insomnia is not better explained by another sleep disorder, such as
narcolepsy (or does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep disor-
der); is not due to the effects of a substance (e.g., caffeine); and is not better explained
by a coexisting medical condition or mental disorder.

Specifiers

Co-occurring mental health, substance use, and sleep disorders can be specified. In
addition, there are three specifiers for the course of insomnia disorder: _episodic_ (symp-
toms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months), _persistent_ (symptoms last 3 months
or longer), and _recurrent_ (two or more episodes occur within the space of 1 year). Per-
sistent insomnia is also associated with long-term consequences, including increased
risks of major depressive disorder, hypertension, and myocardial infarction; increased
absenteeism and reduced productivity at work; reduced quality of life; and increased
economic burden.

Hypersomnolence Disorder

Excessive sleepiness poses a great challenge to the nearly one-third of adult Ameri-
cans who report this problem (Ohayon et al. 2012). Although most healthy people re-
quire approximately 7 hours of sleep during the main sleep episode to feel refreshed
and alert, many individuals curtail their sleep to meet social, vocational, or other de-
mands. This exacts a high price, and many of these people struggle with excessive day-
time sleepiness when they should be fully awake.
Excessive sleepiness can be associated with many sleep disorders, such as obstruc-
tive sleep apnea hypopnea, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, and restless legs
syndrome. It can also be induced by insomnia disorder, insufficient sleep, or poor sleep
hygiene. When excessive sleepiness is associated with other symptoms, it qualifies for
the diagnosis hypersomnolence disorder.
Dement et al. (1966) proposed that individuals with excessive daytime sleepiness,
but without cataplexy, sleep paralysis, or sleep-onset REM periods, not be considered
as having narcolepsy. Roth et al. (1972) later described a type of hypersomnia with
sleep drunkenness that consists of difficulty coming to complete wakefulness, confu-


**246** DSM-5 Guidebook

sion, disorientation, poor motor coordination, and slowness, accompanied by deep
and prolonged sleep. Abrupt sleep attacks seen in classic narcolepsy are not present
in hypersomnolence disorder.
DSM-5 hypersomnolence disorder should be distinguished from excessive sleepi-
ness related to insufficient sleep and from fatigue (tiredness not necessarily relieved by
increased sleep and unrelated to sleep quantity or quality). Excessive sleepiness and fa-
tigue are difficult to differentiate from hypersomnolence disorder and may overlap con-
siderably. Individuals with this disorder have no difficulty falling asleep and have a
sleep efficiency generally higher than 90%. They may experience confusional arousal
upon awakening in the morning but also upon awakening from a daytime nap. During
that period, the person appears awake but his or her behavior may be very inappropri-
ate, with memory deficits, disorientation in time and space, and slow mentation and
speech. The reduced vigilance and impaired cognitive response return to normal within
30–60 minutes (and sometimes longer). For some individuals with hypersomnolence
disorder, the duration of the major sleep episode (nocturnal sleep for most individuals)
is 9 hours or more. However, approximately 80% of individuals with a hypersomno-
lence disorder report their sleep as being nonrestorative, and just as many have difficul-
ties awakening in the morning. Individuals with a hypersomnolence disorder may have
daytime naps nearly every day regardless of the nocturnal sleep duration.
Several changes have been made from DSM-IV. DSM-5 has replaced the term _hyper-
somnia_ with _hypersomnolence._ The disorder is characterized by a complaint of excessive
sleepiness, which can be expressed in two main categories of symptoms: 1) excessive
quantity of sleep, referring to extended nocturnal sleep or involuntary daytime sleep,
and 2) deteriorated quality of wakefulness, referring to sleep propensity during
wakefulness as shown by difficulty awakening or inability to remain awake when re-
quired. With DSM-IV, in many cases, severe excessive sleepiness symptoms remained
undiagnosed because the excessive sleepiness was related to the quality of wakefulness,
not the _quantity_ of sleep. The term _hypersomnia_ describes an excessive amount of sleep,
whereas _hypersomnolence_ refers to the main symptom of excessive sleepiness. Research
shows that many individuals have excessive sleepiness that is not explained by an-
other sleep disorder, but with normal amounts of sleep.
Epidemiological and clinical data indicate that individuals with hypersomnolence
disorder often present with other psychiatric or medical conditions. DSM-5 has re-
placed three disorders—primary hypersomnia, hypersomnia related to another mental
disorder, and sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, hypersomnia type—
with a single diagnostic entity with specification of clinically comorbid conditions.
The change in the terminology removes the need to make causal attributions between
coexisting disorders and acknowledges the interactive effects of sleep disorders and co-
existing medical and/or psychiatric disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Hypersomnolence Disorder **307.44 (F51.11)**

A. Self-reported excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence) despite a main sleep pe-
riod lasting at least 7 hours, with at least one of the following symptoms:


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **247**

1. Recurrent periods of sleep or lapses into sleep within the same day.
2. A prolonged main sleep episode of more than 9 hours per day that is nonrestor-
    ative (i.e., unrefreshing).
3. Difficulty being fully awake after abrupt awakening.

B. The hypersomnolence occurs at least three times per week, for at least 3 months.
C. The hypersomnolence is accompanied by significant distress or impairment in
cognitive, social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The hypersomnolence is not better explained by and does not occur exclusively
during the course of another sleep disorder (e.g., narcolepsy, breathing-related
sleep disorder, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, or a parasomnia).
E. The hypersomnolence is not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-
stance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).
F. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not adequately explain the predomi-
nant complaint of hypersomnolence.

Specify if:
**With mental disorder,** including substance use disorders
**With medical condition
With another sleep disorder
Coding note:** The code 780.54 (G47.10) applies to all three specifiers. Code also
the relevant associated mental disorder, medical condition, or other sleep disorder
immediately after the code for hypersomnolence disorder in order to indicate the
association.

Specify if:
**Acute:** Duration of less than 1 month.
**Subacute:** Duration of 1–3 months.
**Persistent:** Duration of more than 3 months.

Specify current severity:
Specify severity based on degree of difficulty maintaining daytime alertness as mani-
fested by the occurrence of multiple attacks of irresistible sleepiness within any given
day occurring, for example, while sedentary, driving, visiting with friends, or working.
**Mild:** Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 1–2 days/week.
**Moderate:** Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 3–4 days/week.
**Severe:** Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 5–7 days/week.

Criterion A

The clinical description of excessive sleepiness symptoms in DSM-IV was vague (i.e.,
complaint of excessive sleepiness “as evidenced by either prolonged sleep episodes
or daytime sleep episodes that occur almost daily”). In many cases, severe excessive
sleepiness symptoms remained undiagnosed because the excessive sleepiness was re-
lated to the _quality_ of wakefulness, not the _quantity_ of sleep. Additionally, in DSM-IV,
no cut point was given to delineate what constituted a prolonged sleep episode. The
threshold of 9 hours as indicative of a prolonged main sleep episode will help identify
individuals with excessive amount of sleep. The choice of 9 hours was based on clinical


**248** DSM-5 Guidebook

evidence that individuals with hypersomnolence disorder (with or without long sleep
time) sleep on average 8–8.5 hours on weekdays, and it represents the upper fifth per-
centile of the normal sleep distribution in the general population.
The DSM-IV symptom “daytime sleep episodes” has been refined: “Recurrent pe-
riods of sleep or lapses into sleep within the same day.” This change allows for the
inclusion of individuals who have a main sleep period of normal duration, defined as
at least 7 hours of sleep, and have recurrent sleepiness episodes within the same day
(at least two episodes). The duration of 7 hours was adopted because it is the average
sleep duration of healthy adults, and it should reduce the possibility of including in-
dividuals whose excessive sleepiness might be due to insufficient sleep.
DSM-5 has added “difficulty being fully awake after abrupt awakening” as a core
feature of excessive sleepiness. Difficulty in awakening from sleep is present in the ma-
jority of individuals (up to 78%) with hypersomnolence characterized by a long sleep
time. Sleep inertia (sleep drunkenness) has been reported in 21%–72% of individuals
with a hypersomnolence disorder. The addition of this symptom will increase precision
in the identification of hypersomnolent individuals.

Criterion B

DSM-5 has added a minimum frequency criterion (i.e., three times per week) with ex-
cessive sleepiness. The frequency criterion (at least three times per week) was selected
based on population data indicating that it was the best cutoff for sleepiness in terms
of identifying individuals reporting impairment or distress associated with excessive
sleepiness. The DSM-5 criterion replaces the “almost daily” requirement in DSM-IV
and will help distinguish individuals with occasional sleepiness from those with more
severe symptoms of excessive sleepiness.
DSM-5 also requires that the excessive sleepiness last at least 3 months. DSM-IV
required a duration of 1 month, but that was perceived as too short a period to define
excessive sleepiness as a chronic condition. Given that hypersomnolence disorder is
generally a chronic condition, typically beginning in early adulthood, a time frame that
reflects longer-term chronicity was chosen.

Criterion C

Irritability and cognitive dysfunction are frequent concerns of hypersomnolent indi-
viduals. Other symptoms may include anxiety, decreased energy, restlessness, slow
speech, loss of appetite, and memory difficulties. Some individuals lose the ability to
function in family, social, occupational, or other settings. Motor vehicle accidents are
among the most serious of consequences stemming from excessive sleepiness. The Na-
tional Sleep Foundation’s (2005) Sleep in America poll indicated that 60% of behind-
the-wheel adults have driven a motor vehicle while drowsy, and 13% have actually fallen
asleep while driving at least once per month.

Criteria D, E, and F

Individuals with breathing-related sleep disorders may have patterns of excessive
sleepiness, and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are also often characterized by


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **249**

daytime sleepiness. Complaints of daytime sleepiness may occur with medical con-
ditions (e.g., a major neurocognitive disorder), medications (e.g., antipsychotics), or
mental disorders (e.g., during a major depressive episode or the depressed phase of
bipolar disorder). A diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder can be made in the pres-
ence of another current or past mental disorder as long as the other disorder does not
completely explain the hypersomnolence.

Specifiers

The clinician may specify the presence of comorbid conditions: another mental disor-
der, including substance use disorders; another medical condition; and another sleep
disorder. In each case, the specifier helps clarify the individual’s condition.
In addition to the specifiers regarding co-occurring conditions, there are three
specifiers available to describe course: _acute_ (duration of less than 1 month), _subacute_
(duration of 1–3 months), and _persistent_ (duration of more than 3 months). Severity
specifiers, based on difficulty maintaining daytime alertness, are included as well.

Narcolepsy

Narcolepsy is a disorder that leads to instability in the sleep-wake cycle. It causes ex-
cessive daytime sleepiness and leads to sudden onsets of REM sleep. Narcolepsy can
put severe limitations on individuals’ lives because of their inability to stay awake for
long periods of time and because of the risk that accompanies sudden bouts of sleep-
ing. It is a chronic condition that is treatable but not curable. Symptoms usually begin
either between ages 15 and 25 years or between ages 30 and 35 years, but they can be-
gin at any age. They include episodes of extreme drowsiness every 3–4 hours, dream-
like hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy (i.e., loss of all muscle tone in the body),
and “sleep attacks” (i.e., short attacks triggered by varying conditions such as eating
large meals, moments of high stress or tension, or being awake for more than 4 hours).
Cataplexy can cause a person’s head to drop or knees to buckle, or might cause the
person to collapse in his or her seat or onto the floor, potentially leading to dangerous
consequences.
The term _narcolepsy_ was first used in 1880 by the French neurologist Gélineau, who
used the term to describe a syndrome of recurrent, irresistible daytime sleep episodes,
sometimes accompanied by sudden falls (Morin and Edinger 2009). The disorder was
first included in DSM-IV and continues to be recognized in DSM-5. In the ICSD-2, both
narcolepsy with catalepsy and narcolepsy without catalepsy are recognized as dis-
tinctive subtypes.
Evidence shows that narcolepsy is associated with a lowered amount of a protein
called _hypocretin_ in the brain. In the 1990s, hypocretin-2 gene deletions were found to
be the disease mechanism in canine narcolepsy. In human studies, low levels of hypo-
cretin-1 are found in the cerebrospinal fluid of narcolepsy patients, and losses of over
80% of hypocretin (orexin)–producing neurons in the dorsolateral hypothalamus have
been reported in autopsy studies. One explanation might be that hypocretin-produc-
ing cells are destroyed by an autoimmune process.


**250** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Narcolepsy

A. Recurrent periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping
occurring within the same day. These must have been occurring at least three
times per week over the past 3 months.
B. The presence of at least one of the following:

1. Episodes of cataplexy, defined as either (a) or (b), occurring at least a few
    times per month:
    a. In individuals with long-standing disease, brief (seconds to minutes) epi-
       sodes of sudden bilateral loss of muscle tone with maintained conscious-
       ness that are precipitated by laughter or joking.
    b. In children or in individuals within 6 months of onset, spontaneous grimaces
       or jaw-opening episodes with tongue thrusting or a global hypotonia, with-
       out any obvious emotional triggers.
2. Hypocretin deficiency, as measured using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocre-
    tin-1 immunoreactivity values (less than or equal to one-third of values ob-
    tained in healthy subjects tested using the same assay, or less than or equal
    to 110 pg/mL). Low CSF levels of hypocretin-1 must not be observed in the
    context of acute brain injury, inflammation, or infection.
3. Nocturnal sleep polysomnography showing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
    latency less than or equal to 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test show-
    ing a mean sleep latency less than or equal to 8 minutes and two or more
    sleep-onset REM periods.

Specify whether:
**347.00 (G47.419) Narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency:**
Criterion B requirements of low CSF hypocretin-1 levels and positive polysomnog-
raphy/multiple sleep latency test are met, but no cataplexy is present (Criterion B1
not met).
**347.01 (G47.411) Narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin defi-
ciency:** In this rare subtype (less than 5% of narcolepsy cases), Criterion B re-
quirements of cataplexy and positive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test
are met, but CSF hypocretin-1 levels are normal (Criterion B2 not met).
**347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narco-
lepsy:** This subtype is caused by exon 21 DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-1

low or intermediate CSF hypocretin-1 levels), deafness, cerebellar ataxia, and
eventually dementia.

igodendrocyte glycoprotein gene.
**347.10 (G47.429) Narcolepsy secondary to another medical condition:** This
subtype is for narcolepsy that develops secondary to medical conditions that cause
infectious (e.g., Whipple’s disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral destruction
of hypocretin neurons.

Coding note (for ICD-9-CM code 347.10 only): Code first the underlying medical

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Infrequent cataplexy (less than once per week), need for naps only once or
twice per day, and less disturbed nocturnal sleep.
**Moderate:** Cataplexy once daily or every few days, disturbed nocturnal sleep, and
need for multiple naps daily.
**Severe:** Drug-resistant cataplexy with multiple attacks daily, nearly constant
sleepiness, and disturbed nocturnal sleep (i.e., movements, insomnia, and vivid
dreaming).

Criterion A

The wording of Criterion A has been changed from “Irresistible attacks of refreshing
sleep that occur daily over at least 3 months” to focus on recurrent periods of an irre-
pressible need to sleep, lapses into sleep, or naps, occurring at least three times per
week over the previous 3 months (when the individual is untreated).

Criterion B

In DSM-IV, only one of two criteria had to be met. In this revision, at least one of three
criteria has to be met. Narcolepsy was originally described with the presence of cata-
plexy. Cataplexy is usually triggered by strong emotions, but studies have shown the
type of emotions is more important than the intensity. Interestingly, joking is the most
specific trigger that distinguishes true cataplexy in individuals with narcolepsy from
other experiences reported by individuals without narcolepsy. Laughter is also com-
monly involved, although it may be more culturally dependent because mirth is the
true trigger. In addition, cataplexy is almost always brief, and fewer than 15% of pa-
tients report that their attacks last longer than 2 minutes. From 5% to 10% of persons
report having one attack per year (or fewer), and less than 20% report having attacks
at least monthly (Dauvilliers et al. 2007). For this reason, several attacks per month is
considered a reasonable frequency. For young children, the disorder may have a rapid
onset that can occur over a few weeks. In these cases, cataplexy manifests differently,
by semiconstant, tic-like partial hypotonia of the jaw with tongue protrusion or even
a generalized weakness without a clear trigger. These rare cases evolve into the more
classic form (with usual trigger) within 6 months to 1 year.
The finding of low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels in individuals
with narcolepsy has been replicated by investigators around the world. The particu-
lar threshold of less than or equal to one-third of mean control values, or 110 pg/mL,
has been established by quantitative ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves
comparing samples drawn from individuals with narcolepsy with samples from
healthy controls, patients with other sleep disorders (including narcolepsy without
cataplexy, hypersomnia, insomnia), and patients with various acute or chronic neuro-
logical conditions (Burgess and Scammell 2012). Additionally, normal subjects essen-


**252** DSM-5 Guidebook

tially never have low CSF hypocretin levels, but some patients with severe acute
neurological disorders (e.g., acute meningitis, severe head trauma) can have decreased
CSF hypocretin, a finding that is reversible when or if the condition improves. Narco-
lepsy with cataplexy is almost always caused by hypocretin deficiency. Almost all pa-
tients with cataplexy have low or undetectable levels of hypocretin-1 in the CSF. In
contrast, only 5%–30% of cases without cataplexy have low CSF hypocretin-1 levels.
In the late 1950s, it was discovered that individuals with narcolepsy also have a
short REM sleep latency, a finding that led to using the multiple sleep latency test
(MSLT) as a diagnostic test for narcolepsy (nocturnal sleep polysomnography show-
ing mean sleep latency 15 minutes or, more recently, MSLT showing mean sleep la-
tency 8 minutes with 2 sleep-onset REM periods in 4–5 naps as a positive test). The
MSLT for narcolepsy-cataplexy has shown about 95% sensitivity and specificity, both
when cataplexy is used as a gold standard and when CSF hypocretin has been mea-
sured. Research shows that the observation of a short REM latency during a nocturnal
sleep study is more specific (~ 99%) but less sensitive (~ 50%) than a positive MSLT
result (Andlauer et al. 2013). Sleep test criteria consistent with narcolepsy can be ei-
ther a sleep-onset REM period at night (i.e., REM sleep latency 15 minutes) or a posi-
tive MSLT finding.

Subtypes and Specifiers

The subtypes allow the clinician to be more specific about causation by pinpointing
the relationship of narcolepsy to hypocretin deficiency, chromosome 21 mutations,
type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurological disorders, or an infectious cause. Current sever-
ity (mild, moderate, severe) may also be specified.

BREATHING-RELATED SLEEP DISORDERS

Rather than having a single set of criteria for breathing-related sleep disorder, as pro-
vided in DSM-IV, DSM-5 provides specific diagnostic criteria for a spectrum of
breathing-related sleep disorders: obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep
apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation. Although these disorders may share com-
mon underlying physiological risk factors (respiratory control instability), physiolog-
ical and anatomical studies indicate differences in the pathogenesis of these disorders,
with central sleep apnea less dependent on structural airway abnormalities as com-
pared with obstructive sleep apnea, which is more dependent on increased upper air-
way resistance, and sleep-related hypoventilation, which is often comorbid with
other disorders that depress ventilation. DSM-5 provides an overview of these inter-
related disorders and specific definitions for each of these entities.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is the most common category of breathing-related
sleep disorders. It is a potentially serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly
stops and starts during sleep. A pause in breathing (and therefore total absence of
airflow) is called an _apnea_ episode. A decrease in airflow during breathing is called a


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **253**

_hypopnea_ episode. Almost everyone has brief apnea episodes during sleep. The per-
son with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is rarely aware of having difficulty
breathing, even upon awakening. When the muscles relax, a person’s airway narrows
or closes as he or she breathes in, and breathing may be inadequate for 10–20 seconds.
This period of inadequate breathing may lower the level of oxygen in the blood. The
brain senses this impaired breathing and briefly rouses the person from sleep.
The most noticeable sign of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is _snoring._ This is
recognized as a problem by others witnessing the individual during sleep episodes or
is suspected because of its effects on the body. Because the muscle tone of the body
ordinarily relaxes during sleep, and the airway at the throat is composed of walls of
soft tissue, which can collapse, it is not surprising that breathing can be obstructed
during sleep. Although a very minor degree of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is
considered to be within the bounds of normal sleep, and many individuals experi-
ence episodes of obstructive sleep apnea at some point in life, only a small percentage
of people are afflicted with chronic, severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.
Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea most commonly affects middle-age and older
adults and people who are overweight. Signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep ap-
nea hypopnea include excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia), loud snoring,
observed episodes of breathing cessation during sleep, abrupt awakenings accompa-
nied by shortness of breath, awakening with a dry mouth or sore throat, morning
headache, difficulty staying asleep (insomnia), and difficult-to-control high blood
pressure. The breathing disruptions impair the ability to reach the desired deep, rest-
ful phases of sleep, resulting in sleepiness during waking hours. Diagnosis is based
on polysomnographic findings and on symptoms.

Diagnostic Criteria for Obstructive Sleep
Apnea Hypopnea **327.23 (G47.33)**

A. Either (1) or (2):

1. Evidence by polysomnography of at least five obstructive apneas or hypop-
    neas per hour of sleep and either of the following sleep symptoms:
    a. Nocturnal breathing disturbances: snoring, snorting/gasping, or breathing
       pauses during sleep.
    b. Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient oppor-
       tunities to sleep that is not better explained by another mental disorder (in-
       cluding a sleep disorder) and is not attributable to another medical
       condition.
2. Evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more obstructive apneas and/or hypop-
    neas per hour of sleep regardless of accompanying symptoms.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Apnea hypopnea index is less than 15.
**Moderate:** Apnea hypopnea index is 15–30.
**Severe:** Apnea hypopnea index is greater than 30.


**254** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion A

DSM-5 includes symptoms of nocturnal breathing disturbances in the diagnostic cri-
teria for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Nocturnal symptoms reflect the occur-
rence of breathing disorders during the sleep period. Objective measurements of
snoring intensity correlate with apnea hypopnea index. Snoring and gasping contrib-
ute significantly to sleep apnea prediction and in some studies are the most signifi-
cant symptoms associated with sleep apnea. DSM-5 also includes polysomnographic
criteria in the diagnostic criteria. Symptom reports are not sufficiently sensitive or
specific to diagnose breathing-related sleep disorders, although they can be used as
screening tools.

Specifiers

The severity of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is delineated based on an apnea hy-
popnea index (i.e., the number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep, as deter-
mined by polysomnography or other overnight monitoring). The disorder is mild if the
index is less than 15, moderate if the index is between 15 and 30, and severe if the index
is greater than 30. Regardless of the apnea hypopnea index, the disorder is considered
to be more severe when apneas and hypopneas are accompanied by significant oxygen
hemoglobin desaturation or when sleep is severely fragmented as shown by an ele-
vated arousal index (arousal index greater than 30) or reduced stages in deep sleep.

Central Sleep Apnea

Central sleep apnea is a disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts dur-
ing sleep. It occurs because the brain fails to send proper signals to the muscles that
control breathing. In contrast, in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, a person cannot
breathe normally because of upper airway obstruction. Central sleep apnea is less com-
mon, accounting for fewer than 5% of sleep apnea cases.
Common signs and symptoms of central sleep apnea include observed episodes
of stopped breathing or abnormal breathing patterns during sleep, abrupt awaken-
ings accompanied by shortness of breath, shortness of breath relieved by sitting up,
difficulty staying asleep (insomnia), excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia), dif-
ficulty concentrating, morning headaches, and snoring. Although snoring indicates
some degree of increased obstruction of airflow, snoring may also be heard in the pres-
ence of central sleep apnea; however, snoring may not be as prominent with central
sleep apnea as it is with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Central sleep apnea is as-
sociated with several conditions, including heart failure and chronic opioid use.
In DSM-IV, central sleep apnea was included in the breathing-related sleep disor-
der diagnosis and did not have separate criteria. Specific diagnostic criteria for central
sleep apnea have been developed for DSM-5.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **255**

Diagnostic Criteria for Central Sleep Apnea

A. Evidence by polysomnography of five or more central apneas per hour of sleep.
B. The disorder is not better explained by another current sleep disorder.

Specify whether:
**327.21 (G47.31) Idiopathic central sleep apnea:** Characterized by repeated epi-
sodes of apneas and hypopneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory
effort but without evidence of airway obstruction.
**786.04 (R06.3) Cheyne-Stokes breathing:** A pattern of periodic crescendo-
decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas and hypop-
neas at a frequency of at least five events per hour, accompanied by frequent
arousal.
**780.57 (G47.37) Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use:** The pathogen-
esis of this subtype is attributed to the effects of opioids on the respiratory rhythm
generators in the medulla as well as the differential effects on hypoxic versus hy-
percapnic respiratory drive.

**Coding note** (for 780.57 [G47.37] code only): When an opioid use disorder is present,
first code the opioid use disorder: 305.50 (F11.10) mild opioid use disorder or 304.00
(F11.20) moderate or severe opioid use disorder; then code 780.57 (G47.37) central
sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use. When an opioid use disorder is not present
(e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), code only 780.57 (G47.37) central
sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use.

**Note:** See the section “Diagnostic Features” in DSM-5 text.

Specify current severity:
Severity of central sleep apnea is graded according to the frequency of the breathing
disturbances as well as the extent of associated oxygen desaturation and sleep frag-
mentation that occur as a consequence of repetitive respiratory disturbances.

Criteria A and B

Apnea episodes require polysomnographic data indicating five or more central ap-
neas per hour of sleep. Clinical symptoms are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to
diagnose central sleep apnea, although they can be used as a screening tool. Other
sleep disorders need to be ruled out as a cause of the disturbance.

Subtypes and Specifiers

Clinicians may indicate if 1) the disorder is idiopathic and unrelated to airway ob-
struction, 2) a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern is present (characterized by a pattern
of periodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central ap-
neas and hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are
accompanied by frequent arousals), or 3) the disorder appears to be comorbid with opi-
oid use. Current severity may also be recorded.


**256** DSM-5 Guidebook

Sleep-Related Hypoventilation

Sleep-related hypoventilation is the result of decreased respiration associated with el-
evated carbon dioxide levels during sleep. Sleep-related hypoventilation is character-
ized by frequent episodes of shallow breathing lasting longer than 10 seconds during
sleep. It is frequently associated with lung disease or neuromuscular or chest wall dis-
orders, or medication use.
DSM-5 provides specific diagnostic criteria for sleep-related hypoventilation rather
than, as in DSM-IV, incorporating the condition within the single criteria set for breath-
ing-related sleep disorder. Although breathing-related sleep disorders may share
common underlying physiological risk factors (respiratory control instability), phys-
iological and anatomical studies indicate differences in the pathogenesis of these dis-
orders, with sleep-related hypoventilation often comorbid with other disorders that
depress ventilation.

Diagnostic Criteria for Sleep-Related Hypoventilation

A. Polysomnograpy demonstrates episodes of decreased respiration associated with
elevated CO 2 levels. ( **Note:** In the absence of objective measurement of CO 2 , persis-
tent low levels of hemoglobin oxygen saturation unassociated with apneic/hypop-
neic events may indicate hypoventilation.)
B. The disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep disorder.

Specify whether:
**327.24 (G47.34) Idiopathic hypoventilation:** This subtype is not attributable to
any readily identified condition.
**327.25 (G47.35) Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation:** This subtype is a
rare congenital disorder in which the individual typically presents in the perinatal
period with shallow breathing, or cyanosis and apnea during sleep.
**327.26 (G47.36) Comorbid sleep-related hypoventilation:** This subtype occurs
as a consequence of a medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder (e.g., in-
terstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or a neuromuscular
or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular dystrophies, postpolio syndrome, cervical
spinal cord injury, kyphoscoliosis), or medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, opi-
ates). It also occurs with obesity (obesity hypoventilation disorder), where it re-
flects a combination of increased work of breathing due to reduced chest wall
compliance and ventilation-perfusion mismatch and variably reduced ventilatory
drive. Such individuals usually are characterized by body mass index of greater
than 30 and hypercapnia during wakefulness (with a pCO 2 of greater than 45), with-
out other evidence of hypoventilation. 

Specify current severity:
Severity is graded according to the degree of hypoxemia and hypercarbia present
during sleep and evidence of end organ impairment due to these abnormalities
(e.g., right-sided heart failure). The presence of blood gas abnormalities during wake-
fulness is an indicator of greater severity.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **257**

Criteria A and B

As is the case for the other sleep disorders, specific polysomnographic findings are
required for the diagnosis. Other sleep disorders need to be ruled out before making
this diagnosis.

Subtypes and Specifiers

The clinician can record whether the hypoventilation is idiopathic, attributable to the
rare congenital central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (which presents in the
perinatal period with shallow breathing, or cyanosis and apnea during sleep), or at-
tributable to a comorbid disorder such as a pulmonary disease. Current severity may be
indicated as well.

CIRCADIAN RHYTHM SLEEP-WAKE DISORDERS

Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders

Human beings have biological rhythms known as _circadian rhythms_ that are controlled
by a biological clock and that work on a daily time scale. The rhythms affect body
temperature, alertness, appetite, and hormone secretion, as well as sleep timing.
Because of a person’s circadian clock, sleepiness does not continuously increase as
time passes. A person’s desire and ability to fall asleep are influenced both by the length
of time since the person woke from an adequate sleep and by internal circadian
rhythms. Thus, the body is ready for sleep and for wakefulness at different times of
the day.
A circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder is a persistent or recurring pattern of sleep
disruption resulting either from an altered sleep-wake schedule or from an inequality
between a person’s natural sleep-wake cycle and the sleep-related demands placed
on him or her. The term _circadian rhythm_ refers to a person’s internal sleep- and wake-
related rhythms that occur throughout a 24-hour period. The sleep disruption leads
to insomnia or excessive sleepiness during the day, resulting in impaired functioning.
People with circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are unable to sleep and wake at
the times required for normal work, school, and social needs; however, they are gen-
erally able to get enough sleep if allowed to sleep and wake at the times dictated by
their body clocks. Unless they also have another sleep disorder, their sleep is of normal
quality.
DSM-5 circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder criteria differ from DSM-IV in two
notable areas. First, the name has changed from “circadian rhythm sleep disorders.”
Although it is well appreciated that individuals with circadian rhythm sleep-wake
disorders have difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, they also prominently
suffer from impairment of wakefulness and often seek treatment for excessive sleep-
iness. Thus, the term _sleep-wake_ captures the daytime and nighttime impairments in
function that are characteristic of circadian dysfunction. Second, specifiers have been
revised, as described later in this section.


**258** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Circadian Rhythm
Sleep-Wake Disorders

A. A persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that is primarily due to an alter-
ation of the circadian system or to a misalignment between the endogenous circa-
dian rhythm and the sleep–wake schedule required by an individual’s physical
environment or social or professional schedule.
B. The sleep disruption leads to excessive sleepiness or insomnia, or both.
C. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, and other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note:** For ICD-9-CM, code **307.45** for all subtypes. For ICD-10-CM, code is
based on subtype.

Specify whether:
**307.45 (G47.21) Delayed sleep phase type:** A pattern of delayed sleep onset and
awakening times, with an inability to fall asleep and awaken at a desired or con-
ventionally acceptable earlier time.
Specify if:
**Familial:** A family history of delayed sleep phase is present.
Specify if:
**Overlapping with non-24-hour sleep-wake type:** Delayed sleep phase
type may overlap with another circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, non-
24-hour sleep-wake type.
**307.45 (G47.22) Advanced sleep phase type:** A pattern of advanced sleep onset
and awakening times, with an inability to remain awake or asleep until the desired
or conventionally acceptable later sleep or wake times.
Specify if:
**Familial:** A family history of advanced sleep phase is present.
**307.45 (G47.23) Irregular sleep-wake type:** A temporally disorganized sleep-
wake pattern, such that the timing of sleep and wake periods is variable through-
out the 24-hour period.
**307.45 (G47.24) Non-24-hour sleep-wake type:** A pattern of sleep-wake cycles
that is not synchronized to the 24-hour environment, with a consistent daily drift
(usually to later and later times) of sleep onset and wake times.
**307.45 (G47.26) Shift work type:** Insomnia during the major sleep period and/or
excessive sleepiness (including inadvertent sleep) during the major awake period
associated with a shift work schedule (i.e., requiring unconventional work hours).
**307.45 (G47.20) Unspecified type**

Specify if:
**Episodic:** Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.
**Persistent:** Symptoms last 3 months or longer.
**Recurrent:** Two or more episodes occur within the space of 1 year.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **259**

Criteria A, B, and C

The sleep disruption is primarily due to a circadian system alteration or a mismatch
between the demands of the person’s environment or work/social schedule and the
person’s internal circadian sleep-wake cycle. This mismatch leads to sleep distur-
bances, which in turn result in excessive sleepiness or insomnia, or both, as well as dis-
tress or functional impairment.

Subtypes and Specifiers

Subtypes include delayed sleep phase type, advanced sleep phase type, irregular
sleep-wake type, non-24-hour sleep-wake type, and shift work type, as well as an un-
specified type. The delayed sleep phase type may be further specified as familial or
overlapping with non-24-hour sleep-wake type.
Delayed sleep phase type is based on a delay in the timing of the major sleep pe-
riod (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to the desired sleep and wake times, re-
sulting in difficulties waking in the morning and excessive sleepiness at work and
impaired sleep at home.
The diagnosis of advanced sleep phase type is based primarily on a history of an
advance in the timing of the major sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in rela-
tion to the desired sleep and wake times, which results in symptoms of early morning
insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. The rationale for inclusion of advanced
sleep phase type was based on strong empirical evidence of earlier timing of circa-
dian biomarkers, including melatonin and core body temperature rhythms, occurring
2–4 hours earlier than normal.
The diagnosis of irregular sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of
symptoms of insomnia at night (during the usual sleep period) and excessive sleepi-
ness (napping) during the day. This type is characterized by a lack of discernible
sleep-wake circadian rhythm. The individual has no major sleep period, and sleep is
fragmented into at least three periods during the 24-hour day. In otherwise healthy
subjects, the condition may be a result of very poor sleep hygiene; however, the irreg-
ular sleep-wake type is commonly associated with neurological impairment, such as
developmental disability in children and dementia in older adults.
The diagnosis of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of
symptoms of insomnia and/or excessive sleepiness due to lack of a stable entrain-
ment or synchronization between the timing of the endogenous circadian rhythm and
the 24-hour light-dark cycle. Individuals will typically present with periods of insom-
nia, excessive sleepiness, or both, alternating with asymptomatic periods. Starting
with the asymptomatic period when the individual’s sleep phase is aligned to the ex-
ternal environment, sleep latency will gradually increase and the individual will
complain of sleep-onset insomnia. As the sleep phase continues to drift so that clock-
drive for sleep is now in the daytime, individuals will have trouble staying awake
during the day and complain of sleepiness, with subsequent negative impact on af-
fect, cognition, and function. Because the circadian period is not aligned to the exter-
nal 24-hour environment, symptoms will depend on when an individual tries to sleep
in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity. The diagnosis of shift work


**260** DSM-5 Guidebook

type is based on a history of regularly scheduled work outside the daytime window
of 8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. This results in excessive sleepiness at work and impaired sleep
at home.
The DSM-IV jet lag subtype has been dropped. The jet lag subtype was removed
because travel across time zones typically involves transient or short-term impair-
ments, and the sleep-wake dysfunction may represent normal physiology rather than
a pathological response.

PARASOMNIAS

Parasomnias are disorders characterized by abnormal behavioral, experiential, or phys-
iological events occurring in association with sleep, specific sleep stages, or sleep-wake
transitions.

Non–Rapid Eye Movement

Sleep Arousal Disorders

The conditions making up the NREM sleep arousal disorders—sleepwalking and
sleep terrors—represent variations of the simultaneous admixture of elements of both
wakefulness and NREM sleep, a combination that results in the appearance of com-
plex motor behavior without conscious awareness (sometimes called “state dissocia-
tion”). The overlap of these conditions in people and in animals is well established.
The fact that human sleep can be characterized by the simultaneous coexistence of
wake-like and sleeplike electroencephalographic patterns in different cortical areas
supports the state-dissociation concept of NREM sleep arousal disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Non–Rapid Eye Movement
Sleep Arousal Disorders

A. Recurrent episodes of incomplete awakening from sleep, usually occurring during
the first third of the major sleep episode, accompanied by either one of the following:

1. **Sleepwalking:** Repeated episodes of rising from bed during sleep and walking
    about. While sleepwalking, the individual has a blank, staring face; is relatively
    unresponsive to the efforts of others to communicate with him or her; and can
    be awakened only with great difficulty.
2. **Sleep terrors:** Recurrent episodes of abrupt terror arousals from sleep, usually
    beginning with a panicky scream. There is intense fear and signs of autonomic
    arousal, such as mydriasis, tachycardia, rapid breathing, and sweating, during
    each episode. There is relative unresponsiveness to efforts of others to comfort
    the individual during the episodes.

B. No or little (e.g., only a single visual scene) dream imagery is recalled.
C. Amnesia for the episodes is present.
D. The episodes cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **261**

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication).
F. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the episodes of sleep-
walking or sleep terrors.

**Coding note:** For ICD-9-CM, code **307.46** for all subtypes. For ICD-10-CM, code is
based on subtype.

Specify whether:
**307.46 (F51.3) Sleepwalking type**
Specify if:
**With sleep-related eating
With sleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia)
307.46 (F51.4) Sleep terror type**

Criteria A, B, and C

NREM sleep arousal disorders are characterized by repeated episodes of incomplete
arousals from sleep, usually beginning during the first third of the major sleep epi-
sode. The individual may _sleepwalk_ (defined as repeated episodes of complex motor
behavior initiated during sleep, including rising from bed and walking about) or ex-
perience _sleep terrors_ (repeated occurrence of precipitous awakenings from sleep in
abrupt terror, usually beginning with a panicky scream). If the individual awakens af-
ter these arousals, little or none of the dream or only fragmentary, single images are
recalled and the person has amnesia for the episode.

Criteria D, E, and F

Consistent with other DSM-5 disorders, NREM sleep arousal disorders must be asso-
ciated with clinically significant distress or impairment. The physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) must be ruled out as a cause, as must
coexisting other mental disorders and medical conditions.

Nightmare Disorder

Nightmare disorder is characterized by recurrent dreams that feel threatening or
frightening or cause dysphoria. The person becomes fully oriented when awakened
and can usually remember the dream. Because nightmares are relatively common in
the general population, nightmare disorder should be considered only in cases where
the nightmares are recurrent and result in significant distress or impairment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Nightmare Disorder **307.47 (F51.5)**

A. Repeated occurrences of extended, extremely dysphoric, and well-remembered
dreams that usually involve efforts to avoid threats to survival, security, or physical
integrity and that generally occur during the second half of the major sleep episode.


**262** DSM-5 Guidebook

B. On awakening from the dysphoric dreams, the individual rapidly becomes oriented
and alert.
C. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The nightmare symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-
stance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).
E. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not adequately explain the predomi-
nant complaint of dysphoric dreams.
Specify if:
**During sleep onset**

Specify if:
**With associated non–sleep disorder,** including substance use disorders
**With associated other medical condition
With associated other sleep disorder
Coding note:** The code 307.47 (F51.5) applies to all three specifiers. Code
also the relevant associated mental disorder, medical condition, or other
sleep disorder immediately after the code for nightmare disorder in order
to indicate the association.

Specify if:
**Acute:** Duration of period of nightmares is 1 month or less.
**Subacute:** Duration of period of nightmares is greater than 1 month but less
than 6 months.
**Persistent:** Duration of period of nightmares is 6 months or greater.

Specify current severity:
Severity can be rated by the frequency with which the nightmares occur:
**Mild:** Less than one episode per week on average.
**Moderate:** One or more episodes per week but less than nightly.
**Severe:** Episodes nightly.

Criteria A and B

DSM-5 has replaced “repeated awakenings” with “repeated occurrences.” The change
removes the requirement that nightmares awaken the individual and thereby removes
the distinction made by some between nightmares (which cause awakenings) and bad
dreams (which do not). The distress due to nightmares extends beyond the disruptions
of nocturnal sleep that awakenings produce. First, up to 36% of chronic and 56% of
acute nightmare patients report not suffering from awakenings from sleep, whereas as
few as 11% claim that their nightmares always awaken them. Second, 69% of patients
with nightmare disorder report having had at least one (nonawakening) bad dream
whose emotional intensity is of equal or greater magnitude than that reported for their
nightmares. For 22% of individuals, mean intensity ratings for their bad dreams equal
or exceed mean intensity ratings for their nightmares (Hasler and Germain 2009).
Third, even the most unpleasant dreams do not necessarily awaken the sleeper; clini-
cians have described many individuals who dream of dying violently in their dreams


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **263**

without waking up. These findings together point to the existence of a substantial
group of individuals who have extremely intense, disturbing dreams that do not
awaken them. When nightmares terminate upon awakening, the person exhibits a
rapid return to full alertness. Dysphoria may persist into wakefulness and contribute to
difficulty returning to sleep and lasting daytime distress.
DSM-5 has also changed “extended and extremely frightening dreams, usually in-
volving threats to survival, security, or self-esteem” to “extended, extremely dys-
phoric, and well-remembered dreams that usually involve efforts to avoid threats to
survival, security, or physical integrity.” Fear may be the most common emotion char-
acterizing nightmares, but it is by no means the only one. Studies indicate that a variety
of dysphoric emotions occur in nightmares, including anger, sadness, frustration, dis-
gust, confusion, and guilt. In fact, 30% of nightmares and 51% of bad dreams contain
primary emotions other than fear (Nielsen and Zadra 2010)

Criterion C

Nightmares cause more significant subjective distress than demonstrable social or oc-
cupational impairment. If nightmares result in frequent awakenings or sleep avoid-
ance, however, individuals may experience excessive daytime sleepiness, poor
concentration, depression, anxiety, or irritability. Some individuals with nightmare
disorder minimize or underestimate the impact of nightmares on their functioning,
partly due to the lack of clear indicators of such impairments. This could lead to un-
derdiagnosis and undertreatment.

Criteria D and E

The nightmare symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub-
stance. The term _attributable to_ more accurately reflects the fact that the precise causal-
ity of the nightmares is not known. Other mental disorders (e.g., panic disorder) and
medical conditions (e.g., nocturnal seizures) need to be ruled out as possible causes
of the dysphoric dreams. Bereavement may also be a cause of the dreams.

Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder

REM sleep behavior disorder in both human beings and animals is well established
and has the potential to cause dramatic and potentially violent or injurious behavior
arising from REM sleep. Seen in animal experiments in the 1960s, REM sleep behavior
disorder was first described in humans in 1986. Since then, it has been identified as
one of the major types of parasomnias, likely second only in prevalence to the NREM
sleep arousal disorders. The clinical features, polysomnographic findings (present in
nearly every case), and response to medication have been well characterized. REM
sleep behavior disorder is one of the most important causes of sleep-related injurious
or violent behavior.
The extraordinary relationship between REM sleep behavior disorder and neu-
rodegenerative disorders (particularly Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy
bodies, and multiple system atrophy) has been clearly established. At least 50% of in-


**264** DSM-5 Guidebook

dividuals with REM sleep behavior disorder presenting in sleep clinics will eventu-
ally (often with a delay of over 10 years) develop one of these conditions. REM sleep
behavior disorder may be more prevalent in psychiatric populations. In addition, iat-
rogenic REM sleep behavior disorder induced by medications commonly prescribed
by psychiatrists, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake in-
hibitors, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, is becoming increasingly
recognized.

Diagnostic Criteria for Rapid Eye Movement
Sleep Behavior Disorder **327.42 (G47.52)**

A. Repeated episodes of arousal during sleep associated with vocalization and/or com-
plex motor behaviors.
B. These behaviors arise during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and therefore usu-
ally occur more than 90 minutes after sleep onset, are more frequent during the
later portions of the sleep period, and uncommonly occur during daytime naps.
C. Upon awakening from these episodes, the individual is completely awake, alert,
and not confused or disoriented.
D. Either of the following:

1. REM sleep without atonia on polysomnographic recording.
2. A history suggestive of REM sleep behavior disorder and an established
    synucleinopathy diagnosis (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy).

E. The behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning (which may include injury to self or
the bed partner).
F. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
G. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the episodes.

Criteria A, B, C, and D

REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by repeated episodes of arousal, often
associated with vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors, during REM sleep.
These behaviors often reflect motor responses to the content of action-filled or violent
dreams and have been referred to as “dream-enacting behaviors.” These behaviors
may be very bothersome to the individual and the bed partner and can result in sig-
nificant injury (e.g., falling, jumping out of bed, punching, or kicking). These behav-
iors occur only during REM sleep. Upon awakening, the individual is immediately
alert and oriented and can usually recall the dream content. Further, either 1) REM sleep
without atonia on polysomnographic recording or 2) a history suggestive of REM
sleep behavior disorder and an established synucleinopathy diagnosis (e.g., Parkin-
son’s disease) is present.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **265**

Criteria E, F, and G

The diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder requires clinically significant distress
or impairment. The physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a med-
ication) or another medical condition must be ruled out as causing the disturbance,
and coexisting mental or medical disorders must have also been ruled out as a cause.

Restless Legs Syndrome

Restless legs syndrome is a sensorimotor, neurological sleep disorder characterized by a
desire to move the legs (or arms), usually associated with uncomfortable sensations typ-
ically described as creeping, crawling, tingling, burning, or itching. Symptoms are worse
when the individual is at rest, and frequent movements of the legs occur in an effort to
relieve the uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms are worse in the evening or night and in
some individuals occur only in the evening or night. In DSM-5, restless legs syndrome
has been elevated to disorder status. DSM-IV included a brief summary of restless legs
syndrome within the broader category of dyssomnia not otherwise specified.
Restless legs syndrome is common, with prevalence rates from 2.7% to 7.2% (the
lower rates reflecting the added requirement of at least moderate distress). Women
are 1.5–2 times more likely than men to have restless legs syndrome (Allen et al. 2005).
Restless legs syndrome is associated with significant clinical and functional im-
pairment. The disorder is well documented to be associated with reduced sleep time,
sleep fragmentation, and reports of more sleep disturbance. Objective studies dem-
onstrate significant, objective sleep abnormalities for individuals with restless legs
syndrome, with increased latency to sleep and higher arousal index as the most con-
sistent findings.

Diagnostic Criteria for Restless Legs Syndrome **333.94 (G25.81)**

A. An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by or in response to uncomfort-
able and unpleasant sensations in the legs, characterized by all of the following:

1. The urge to move the legs begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity.
2. The urge to move the legs is partially or totally relieved by movement.
3. The urge to move the legs is worse in the evening or at night than during the
    day, or occurs only in the evening or at night.

B. The symptoms in Criterion A occur at least three times per week and have per-
sisted for at least 3 months.
C. The symptoms in Criterion A are accompanied by significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other important
areas of functioning.
D. The symptoms in Criterion A are not attributable to another mental disorder or med-
ical condition (e.g., arthritis, leg edema, peripheral ischemia, leg cramps) and are not
better explained by a behavioral condition (e.g., positional discomfort, habitual foot
tapping).


**266** DSM-5 Guidebook

E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse
or medication (e.g., akathisia).

Criteria A and B

Criteria A and B are in line with the essential diagnostic features as defined in DSM-
IV and are compatible with descriptions in the literature. Urges to move the legs must
occur at least three times per week over a 3-month period to qualify for the diagnosis.
This helps ensure that the disorder is not simply a transient disturbance.

Criterion C

Restless legs syndrome must significantly affect functioning or cause distress. Al-
though the impact of milder symptoms is not well characterized, people may complain
of disruption in at least one activity of daily living, with half reporting a negative im-
pact on mood and nearly half reporting lack of energy. The most common conse-
quences of restless legs syndrome are sleep disturbances, including reduced sleep time
and sleep fragmentation.

Criteria D and E

Symptoms of restless legs syndrome cannot be solely accounted for by another mental
disorder or medical or behavioral condition or by medication effects. The differentia-
tion of restless legs syndrome from other conditions is important because many people
report some urge or need to move the legs while at rest and do not have the disorder.
The most important mimics of restless legs syndrome are leg cramps, positional dis-
comfort, arthralgias or arthritis, myalgias, positional ischemia (numbness), leg edema,
peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, and habitual foot tapping. Muscle “knots” or
cramps, relief with a single postural shift, limitation in joints, soreness on palpation,
and other abnormalities on physical examination are not characteristic of the syn-
drome. Worsening at night and periodic limb movements are more common in restless
legs syndrome than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Sleep Disorder

In DSM-5, substance- and medication-induced sleep disturbances are combined in a
single category. The essential feature of substance/medication-induced sleep disor-
der is a prominent sleep disturbance judged to be primarily associated with the
known effects of a substance of abuse or a medication. These disturbances are rela-
tively common in clinical settings but are not always straightforward to diagnose,
and they depend on several factors, including the type of substance (or medication),
the individual’s response to the agent, and the substance’s pharmacology. For exam-
ple, caffeine is one of the most common causes of disrupted sleep and needs to be
ruled out as a cause in any investigation of insomnia. Depending on the substance,


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **267**

one of four subtypes of sleep disturbance may be reported: insomnia type, daytime
sleepiness type, parasomnia type, and a mixed type for cases in which more than one
type of sleep disturbance is present and none predominates.
DSM-5 has included tobacco-induced sleep disorder in the list of diagnoses. Em-
pirical evidence indicates that nicotine may be a sleep-disturbing substance.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Sleep Disorder

A. A prominent and severe disturbance in sleep.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or after withdrawal from or exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
    Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sleep disorder that is not substance/
medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sleep disorder could in-
clude the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the ces-
sation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-in-
duced sleep disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-re-
lated episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/med-
ication]-induced sleep disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-
10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the
clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced
sleep disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder”).
If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-in-
duced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record
“moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending
on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid sub-
stance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th
position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced


**268** DSM-5 Guidebook

sleep disorder. A moderate or severe tobacco use disorder is required in order to code
a tobacco-induced sleep disorder; it is not permissible to code a comorbid mild tobac-
co use disorder or no tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced sleep disorder.

Specify whether:
**Insomnia type:** Characterized by difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, fre-
quent nocturnal awakenings, or nonrestorative sleep.
**Daytime sleepiness type:** Characterized by predominant complaint of excessive
sleepiness/fatigue during waking hours or, less commonly, a long sleep period.
**Parasomnia type:** Characterized by abnormal behavioral events during sleep.
**Mixed type:** Characterized by a substance/medication-induced sleep problem
characterized by multiple types of sleep symptoms, but no symptom clearly pre-
dominates.

Specify if (see Table 16–1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders”
for diagnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** This specifier should be used if criteria are met
for intoxication with the substance/medication and symptoms developed during the
intoxication period.
**With onset during discontinuation/withdrawal:** This specifier should be used if cri-
teria are met for discontinuation/withdrawal from the substance/medication and symp-

toms developed during, or shortly after, discontinuation of the substance/medication.
```
Criteria A and B

The criteria require that the sleep disturbance be severe. This limits the diagnosis to sleep
problems that merit independent clinical attention. The criteria further require that one
can attribute the sleep disturbance to the pharmacological effects of the substance.


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **269**

Criterion C

Criterion C requires that the disturbance not be better accounted for by a sleep disor-
der that is not induced by a substance or medication. Evidence could include the fol-
lowing: 1) symptoms precede onset of the substance or medication use; 2) symptoms
persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute
withdrawal or severe intoxication; or 3) there is other evidence suggesting the exis-
tence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced sleep disorder (e.g., a his-
tory of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).

Criterion D

If the sleep disturbance occurs only during the course of a delirium, it should not war-
rant a separate diagnosis.

Criterion E

The sleep disturbance from the substance needs to result in clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment. Increased risk for relapse is one unique functional consequence
of this disorder.

Other Specified Insomnia Disorder and

Unspecified Insomnia Disorder

These are residual categories to use for symptoms of an insomnia disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment but do not meet criteria for a more spe-
cific disorder in the class. The category other specified insomnia disorder is used
when the clinician chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation does not
meet full criteria. The clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., brief
insomnia disorder).
The category unspecified insomnia disorder is used when the clinician chooses _not_
to specify the reason the criteria are not met, or there is insufficient information to
make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Insomnia Disorder **780.52 (G47.09)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of insomnia
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
insomnia disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class.
The other specified insomnia disorder category is used in situations in which the cli-
nician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not
meet the criteria for insomnia disorder or any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is
done by recording “other specified insomnia disorder” followed by the specific reason
(e.g., “brief insomnia disorder”).


**270** DSM-5 Guidebook

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Brief insomnia disorder:** Duration is less than 3 months.
2. **Restricted to nonrestorative sleep:** Predominant complaint is nonrestorative
    sleep unaccompanied by other sleep symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep or
    remaining asleep.

Unspecified Insomnia Disorder **780.52 (G47.00)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of insomnia
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
insomnia disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class.
The unspecified insomnia disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for insomnia disorder or
a specific sleep-wake disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Hypersomnolence Disorder

and Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder

These are residual categories to use for symptoms of a hypersomnolence disorder that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment but do not meet criteria for a more
specific disorder in the class. The category other specified hypersomnolence disorder
is used when the clinician chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation
does not meet full criteria. The clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason
(e.g., brief-duration hypersomnolence).
The category unspecified hypersomnolence disorder is used when the clinician
chooses _not_ to specify the reason the criteria are not met, or there is insufficient infor-
mation to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Hypersomnolence
Disorder **780.54 (G47.19)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of hypersom-
nolence disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake dis-
orders diagnostic class. The other specified hypersomnolence disorder category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason


**_Sleep-Wake Disorders_** **271**

that the presentation does not meet the criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any
specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by recording “other specified hypersomno-
lence disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “brief-duration hypersomnolence,”
as in Kleine-Levin syndrome).

Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder **780.54 (G47.10)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of hypersom-
nolence disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake dis-
orders diagnostic class. The unspecified hypersomnolence disorder category is used
in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria
are not met for hypersomnolence disorder or a specific sleep-wake disorder, and in-
cludes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis.

Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder and

Unspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder

The other specified sleep-wake disorder category applies in situations in which symp-
toms characteristic of a sleep-wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
functional impairment predominate but do not meet full criteria for any of the disor-
ders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class, and do not qualify for a diagnosis of
other specified insomnia disorder or other specified hypersomnolence disorder.
The unspecified sleep-wake disorder category applies in situations in which the cli-
nician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sleep-
wake disorder, or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder **780.59 (G47.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sleep-
wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do
not qualify for a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or other specified hy-
persomnolence disorder. The other specified sleep-wake disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done
by recording “other specified sleep-wake disorder” followed by the specific reason


**272** DSM-5 Guidebook

(e.g., “repeated arousals during rapid eye movement sleep without polysomnography
or history of Parkinson’s disease or other synucleinopathy”).

Unspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder **780.59 (G47.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sleep-
wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do
not qualify for a diagnosis of unspecified insomnia disorder or unspecified hypersom-
nolence disorder. The unspecified sleep-wake disorder category is used in situations
in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for
a specific sleep-wake disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

- The revision of the sleep disorders chapter for DSM-5 has been influenced by
    the second edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, pub-
    lished by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
- The diagnosis primary insomnia has been renamed insomnia disorder to avoid
    the differentiation between primary and secondary insomnia. Narcolepsy—now
    known to be associated with hypocretin—is distinguished from other forms of
    hypersomnolence (hypersomnolence disorder).
- Breathing-related sleep disorders are divided into three distinct disorders: obstruc-
    tive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventi-
    lation.
- The subtypes of circadian rhythm sleep disorders (now called circadian rhythm
    sleep-wake disorders) have been expanded to include advanced sleep phase
    type and irregular sleep-wake type, and the jet lag type has been omitted.
- Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and restless legs syndrome have
    achieved independent disorder status. Both were included in DSM-IV as exam-
    ples of a “not otherwise specified” diagnosis.
