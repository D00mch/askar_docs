## The somatic symptom and related disorders are unified by the

presence of physical symptoms and/or excessive concern regarding medical illnesses
or symptoms. The new diagnostic class name was recommended by the DSM-5 So-
matic Symptoms Disorders Work Group because it better reflects the content of the
category and creates less confusion regarding its member disorders than did the for-
mer term _somatoform disorders_.
The concept of unexplained physical complaints was recognized in early editions
of DSM. A broad category of psychoneurotic disorders in DSM-I included “conver-
sion reaction,” in which it was said that the “impulse causing anxiety is ‘converted’
into functional symptoms in organs or parts of the body.. .” (American Psychiatric
Association 1952, p. 32). DSM-II introduced the new category “hysterical neurosis,”
characterized as an “involuntary psychogenic loss of disorder of function... symbolic
of underlying conflicts” (American Psychiatric Association 1968, p. 39). Two subcate-
gories were specified: “hysterical neurosis, conversion type” and “hysterical neuro-
sis, dissociative type.” The former represented continuity with DSM-I’s conversion
reaction and the latter with DSM-I’s dissociative reaction. DSM-III introduced the
new class of _somatoform disorders,_ which included somatization disorder, a syndrome
of unexplained physical complaints, patterned after Briquet’s syndrome (Feighner et
al. 1972) and named after a 19th-century French psychiatrist. Other conditions in-


**202** DSM-5 Guidebook

cluded conversion disorder, psychogenic pain disorder (renamed _somatoform pain dis-
order_ in DSM-III-R and _simplified to pain disorder_ in DSM-IV), hypochondriasis, and
atypical somatoform disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder (dysmorphophobia), un-
differentiated somatoform disorder, and the residual category somatoform disorder
not otherwise specified were added to the class in DSM-III-R. The class was mostly
unchanged in DSM-IV except that criteria for somatization disorder were simplified.
The chapter has been reformulated for DSM-5 and brings together disorders that
were spread among several DSM-IV chapters. Many were listed in DSM-IV in the “So-
matoform Disorders” chapter. In addition, factitious disorder was moved to this
chapter from its own chapter, and psychological factors affecting other medical con-
ditions was moved from “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention.”
On the other hand, body dysmorphic disorder was moved from “Somatoform Disor-
ders” to the new chapter “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders” (see Chap-
ter 7). The somatic symptom and related disorders are listed in Table 10–1.

Although disorders characterized by the presence of somatic symptoms or concerns
are common, nonpsychiatric physicians found the earlier DSM diagnoses confusing
and difficult to understand. DSM-IV’s somatoform disorder diagnoses overlapped,
and clinicians had trouble distinguishing one from another. For these reasons, the di-
agnoses were rarely used and were often ignored. As a case in point, the diagnosis of
somatization disorder was thought by many to be difficult to use because of the require-
ment for what seemed like arbitrary and lengthy symptom counts that changed with
each new DSM edition. The DSM-5 classification minimizes the overlap by reducing
the total number of disorders and their subcategories. Clinicians should find the re-
formulated chapter and the revised criteria more user friendly (Dimsdale and Creed
2009).
There are several important changes from the DSM-IV somatoform disorders.
First, somatic symptom disorder is a new diagnosis that replaces somatization disor-
der, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and undifferentiated somatoform disorder. Because
these disorders all shared the presence of somatic symptoms and similar cognitive
distortions, the work group decided there was little reason for separate diagnoses that
were rarely used. In reconceptualizing these disorders, the work group aimed to make
them more useful.


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **203**

A major criterion for several of these disorders was that symptoms were medically
unexplained. Because of the general unreliability of a clinician’s determination of
whether a symptom is medically based or not, and the fact that such a determination
only encourages “mind-body dualism,” medically unexplained symptoms are no
longer emphasized as core features. Furthermore, unexplained somatic symptoms
sometimes accompany other psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder,
schizophrenia) and some medical conditions, and therefore are often a poor basis for
distinguishing “functional” from genuine physical disorders.
Although many clinicians have had difficulty with the concept of somatoform dis-
orders in general, and patients have found the diagnoses unhelpful and stigmatizing,
these disorders remain important because they can cause considerable subjective dis-
tress and impair functioning. Many individuals with these disorders have repeated
surgeries, develop drug or alcohol use disorders, experience marital instability, and
attempt suicide. Co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders are common. The disor-
ders tend to be chronic, with fluctuations in frequency and severity of symptoms.
In DSM-5, instead of an emphasis on the absence of a medical explanation serving
as an organizing principle for the disorders, the focus is on distressing somatic symp-
toms and abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Basing a diagnosis on the _ab-
sence_ of a medical explanation for the symptoms was as unsatisfying to clinicians as it
was to patients. The work group concluded that incorporating affective, cognitive, and
behavioral components into the criteria improves the validity and clinical utility of the
criteria. Individuals formerly diagnosed with hypochondriasis will now be split be-
tween somatic symptom disorder—for those with somatic symptoms—and illness
anxiety disorder—a new diagnosis for those whose main problem is illness anxiety
that occurs primarily in the absence of somatic symptoms. Pain disorder has been
eliminated as a diagnosis because it was rarely used and was not useful. It was easily
misinterpreted as implying that the person’s pain was psychologically motivated and
“in the patient’s head.” In most cases, individuals had medical disorders that ex-
plained the pain, but it was clear that psychological factors contributed to the pain.
Conversion disorder has been renamed conversion disorder (functional neurolog-
ical symptom disorder) to acknowledge that neurological symptoms are the focus of
concern. The criteria emphasize the importance of the neurological examination and
recognize that relevant psychological factors may not be demonstrable at the time of
the diagnosis. Although the chapter has de-emphasized medically unexplained
symptoms, they remain key features of conversion disorder and pseudocyesis (listed
as an example of an other specified somatic symptom and related disorder). In each
case, medical evaluation can demonstrate that these disorders are inconsistent with
known mechanisms of pathophysiology.

Somatic Symptom Disorder

Somatic symptom disorder is a new omnibus category that replaces DSM-IV’s soma-
tization disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and undifferentiated somatoform
disorder. These diagnoses were rarely used and created confusion for both clinicians
and patients. The new diagnosis de-emphasizes medically unexplained symptoms,


**204** DSM-5 Guidebook

which had a central organizing role for many of the somatoform disorders. Instead,
the category is defined on the basis of distressing somatic symptoms, and the exces-
sive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that arise in response to these symptoms. The
work group felt that the DSM-IV criteria for somatization disorder were overly re-
strictive and that those for undifferentiated somatoform disorder and somatoform
disorder not otherwise specified had such low thresholds that either diagnosis could
apply to a large proportion of individuals seen in primary care. The new diagnosis is
expected to overcome these problems and will be more user friendly.
This new diagnosis follows in the long tradition of recognizing psychiatric disor-
ders whose primary manifestations are somatic symptoms or concerns. Somatic
symptom disorder will likely be used for individuals formerly diagnosed with soma-
tization disorder, hypochondriasis, or pain disorder. To diagnose DSM-IV’s somatiza-
tion disorder, the clinician followed a complicated algorithm that required the
presence of at least eight medically unexplained symptoms, including four pain, two
gastrointestinal, one sexual, and one pseudoneurological. The ensuing distress or
impairment had to be greater than would be expected from the history, physical ex-
amination, or laboratory findings. Many additional patients with fewer unexplained
symptoms were relegated to receiving a diagnosis of undifferentiated somatoform
disorder or somatoform disorder not otherwise specified.

Diagnostic Criteria for Somatic Symptom Disorder **300.82 (F45.1)**

A. One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disrup-
tion of daily life.
B. Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or as-
sociated health concerns as manifested by at least one of the following:

1. Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one’s symp-
    toms.
2. Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms.
3. Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns.

C. Although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the state of
being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months).

Specify if:
**With predominant pain** (previously pain disorder): This specifier is for individuals
whose somatic symptoms predominantly involve pain.

Specify if:
**Persistent:** A persistent course is characterized by severe symptoms, marked im-
pairment, and long duration (more than 6 months).
Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Only one of the symptoms specified in Criterion B is fulfilled.
**Moderate:** Two or more of the symptoms specified in Criterion B are fulfilled.
**Severe:** Two or more of the symptoms specified in Criterion B are fulfilled, plus
there are multiple somatic complaints (or one very severe somatic symptom).


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **205**

Criterion A

This item requires the presence of one or more somatic symptoms that are distressing
or result in significant disruption of daily life. The high bar set by DSM-IV with the
requirement for eight medically unexplained symptoms was confusing. This sim-
plified requirement should encompass the presentation of most of the individuals
whose symptoms formerly met criteria for somatization disorder, pain disorder, and
hypochondriasis.
Persons with somatic symptom disorder are excessively worried about their health,
see their bodily symptoms as unduly threatening, and fear the medical seriousness of
their symptoms. Health concerns often become an organizing principle for the indi-
vidual’s life, dominating all other concerns. Quality of life may be markedly impaired,
and the disorder can lead to a high level of medical care utilization.

Criterion B

Rather than focusing on the medically unexplained nature of symptoms (the empha-
sis since DSM-III), this criterion now requires the presence of excessive thoughts, feel-
ings, and behaviors related to these somatic symptoms or associated health concerns.
This criterion requires at least one of the following: disproportionate and persistent
thoughts about the seriousness of one’s symptoms, persistently high level of anxiety
about health or symptoms, or excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms
or health concerns.

Criterion C

This criterion requires the person to have been persistently symptomatic (typically
for more than 6 months), but not necessarily with any one symptom. Symptom mi-
gration, in which an individual previously preoccupied with a particular symptom
focuses on a new symptom, is not uncommon. For many individuals, preoccupation
with somatic concerns begins early in life and lasts years or decades.

Specifiers

The specifiers allow the clinician to identify individuals whose predominant symp-
tom is pain, as well as to rate the current severity of the condition as mild, moderate,
or severe. Typically, the disorder is more severe when multiple somatic symptoms are
present. The clinician can also specify whether the disorder ‘s course is persistent.

Illness Anxiety Disorder

Research suggests that about one-quarter of persons with hypochondriasis had few
somatic symptoms but were highly anxious and suspicious about the presence of a
serious but undiagnosed medical illness. Most of these patients’ presentations now fit
the new diagnosis illness anxiety disorder. Unlike hypochondriasis, wherein failure
to respond to reassurance is an explicit criterion, illness anxiety disorder has as its pri-


**206** DSM-5 Guidebook

mary focus preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious (and undiagnosed) med-
ical illness.
Although the individual’s concern may be derived from a nonpathological phys-
ical sign or sensation, the distress tends not to come from the physical complaint it-
self, but rather from his or her anxiety about its meaning, significance, or cause. If the
physical sign or symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological sensation, a be-
nign and self-limited dysfunction, or a bodily discomfort not generally considered in-
dicative of disease. If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the person’s anxiety
and preoccupation are clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the
condition. Individuals with this condition are easily alarmed about ill health and do
not respond to appropriate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic tests, or a be-
nign course. The clinician’s attempt to reassure the patient is frequently not helpful.
Incessant worry becomes frustrating to family members and may lead to considerable
strain within marriages and families.

Diagnostic Criteria for Illness Anxiety Disorder **300.7 (F45.21)**

A. Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness.
B. Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity. If an-
other medical condition is present or there is a high risk for developing a medical
condition (e.g., strong family history is present), the preoccupation is clearly exces-
sive or disproportionate.
C. There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is easily alarmed
about personal health status.
D. The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., repeatedly
checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits maladaptive avoidance (e.g.,
avoids doctor appointments and hospitals).
E. Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but the specific ill-
ness that is feared may change over that period of time.
F. The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another mental disorder,
such as somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body
dysmorphic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic
type.

Specify whether:
**Care-seeking type:** Medical care, including physician visits or undergoing tests
and procedures, is frequently used.
**Care-avoidant type:** Medical care is rarely used.

Criterion A

This criterion implies that somatic symptoms, if present, are relatively mild. This is
important because the essence of this disorder is not the presence of symptoms, but
rather the presence of health-related anxieties and preoccupations.


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **207**

Criterion B

This criterion is similar to DSM-IV’s Criterion A for hypochondriasis because both fo-
cus on the concern that one might have a serious illness. The operative word is _preoc-
cupation_ that is clearly excessive or disproportionate.

Criterion C

Although some people rarely think about health concerns, the person whose anxiety
and alarm satisfy this criterion is hypervigilant about his or her health. Such people
tend to monitor their bodies, enlarging the importance of each ache, pain, discolor-
ation, bowel change, or noise.

Criterion D

Like the person with obsessive-compulsive disorder, the person who fears for his or
her health engages in checking behaviors (e.g., to make sure there are no tumors or
swellings) or copes with these feelings through avoidance behaviors.

Criterion E

Preoccupation with the illness must last 6 months or longer, but the specific illness
feared may change over that period of time. In most cases, the clinician will note that
the preoccupation has been chronic for months or years.

Criterion F

Because some psychiatric disorders can be associated with excessive health concerns,
these other mental disorders and medical conditions must be ruled out as a cause of
the disturbance. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder will have other
symptoms (e.g., washing, counting, hoarding). Although individuals with panic dis-
order may have concerns about having a heart attack, this concern occurs in the con-
text of a panic attack.

Subtypes

The subtypes will enable the clinician to identify whether the individual is care seek-
ing or care avoidant.

Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological

Symptom Disorder)

Conversion disorders have a long history in psychiatry. Individuals with this disor-
der have symptoms that simulate or mimic neurological illness. Typical symptoms in-
clude paralysis, abnormal movements, inability to speak (aphonia), blindness, and
deafness. Pseudoseizures are also common and may occur in individuals with genu-
ine epileptic seizures. Individuals with conversion disorders are commonly seen on
neurology wards and on psychiatry consultation-liaison services at general hospitals.


**208** DSM-5 Guidebook

Conversion disorders were described in the nineteenth century by Charcot and
Freud and were considered a form of hysteria. Conversion reaction was included as a
diagnosis in DSM-I. The disorder was renamed hysterical neurosis, conversion type, in
DSM-II, which described it as “an involuntary psychogenic loss or disorder of func-
tion,” with such symptoms as “blindness, deafness, anosmia, anesthesias, paresthesias,
paralyses, ataxias, akinesias, and dyskinesias” (American Psychiatric Association 1968,
pp. 39–40). Criteria were enumerated in DSM-III, with minor wording changes in sub-
sequent editions.
For DSM-5, the name has been changed to include a parenthetical “functional neu-
rological symptom disorder” because the disorder is often seen by neurologists. In
addition, this term is more acceptable to patients. Importantly, DSM-IV Criterion B—
“Psychological factors are judged to be associated with the symptom or deficit be-
cause the initiation or exacerbation of the symptom or deficit is preceded by conflicts
or other stressors” (American Psychiatric Association 2000, p. 457)—has been deleted.
This criterion was always problematic because it was difficult to reliably assess and re-
quired considerable subjective judgment on the part of the clinician. The work group
proposed that the criterion be eliminated and that any discussion about a proposed
etiological factor be placed in the text. Additional concerns were that this DSM-IV cri-
terion was inconsistent with data showing that observed psychological factors are of-
ten nonspecific—that is, they occur in individuals with other conditions, often with a
similar frequency. Furthermore, in many cases psychological factors cannot be convinc-
ingly demonstrated.
Another change is the deletion of DSM-IV Criterion C: “The symptom or deficit is
not intentionally produced or feigned (as in Factitious Disorder or Malingering)”
(American Psychiatric Association 2000, p. 457). This criterion was always difficult for
clinicians to use because it is nearly impossible to know with any degree of confidence
whether or not a person is feigning. Also, there is little evidence that feigning is more
common in individuals with conversion disorder than in persons with other mental
disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Conversion Disorder
(Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)

A. One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function.
B. Clinical findings provide evidence of incompatibility between the symptom and rec-
ognized neurological or medical conditions.
C. The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder.
D. The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evalua-
tion.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for conversion disorder is **300.11,** which is as-
signed regardless of the symptom type. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the symp-
tom type (see below).


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **209**

Specify symptom type:
**(F44.4) With weakness or paralysis
(F44.4) With abnormal movement** (e.g., tremor, dystonic movement, myoclonus,
gait disorder)
**(F44.4) With swallowing symptoms
(F44.4) With speech symptom** (e.g., dysphonia, slurred speech)
**(F44.5) With attacks or seizures
(F44.6) With anesthesia or sensory loss
(F44.6) With special sensory symptom** (e.g., visual, olfactory, or hearing distur-
bance)
**(F44.7) With mixed symptoms**

Specify if:
**Acute episode:** Symptoms present for less than 6 months.
**Persistent:** Symptoms occurring for 6 months or more.

Specify if:
**With psychological stressor** (specify stressor)
**Without psychological stressor**

Criterion A

The essential feature of conversion disorder is the presence of symptoms or subjective
deficits affecting motor or sensory functioning, or apparent impairment in level of
consciousness. Motor symptoms include weakness or paralysis of a body part; abnor-
mal movements, such as tremor, jerky movements, and other hyper- or hypokinetic
movement abnormalities; gait abnormalities; and abnormal limb posturing. Sensory
symptoms include altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing. Epi-
sodes of abnormal generalized limb shaking with apparent impaired or loss of con-
sciousness may resemble epileptic seizures (pseudoseizures). The person may collapse
and be motionless and unresponsive in an episode resembling syncope or coma.
Other symptoms include reduced or absent speech volume, a sensation of a lump in the
throat, and diplopia.

Criterion B

Neurological disease must be excluded as a cause of the symptoms, and there must be
positive evidence of functional neurological symptoms. Positive evidence depends on the
demonstration of either internal inconsistency or incompatibility with disease. Internal
inconsistency means physical evidence of a symptom, such as weakness, that can be dem-
onstrated to be inconsistently present. For example, in Hoover’s sign, weakness of hip ex-
tension returns to normal strength with contralateral hip flexion against resistance.

Criterion C

Other recognized medical conditions and mental disorders must be ruled out. Re-
search shows that some individuals who receive a diagnosis of conversion disorder
are later found to have medical or neurological illnesses that, in retrospect, accounted


**210** DSM-5 Guidebook

for their symptoms. Clinicians need to keep this information in mind and to have a
healthy degree of skepticism. Conversion symptoms sometimes occur in individuals
with depressive or bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, and even schizophrenia. In
these situations, the symptoms are likely attributable to the primary disorder. The pos-
sibility of feigning, as part of either factitious disorder or malingering, should be con-
sidered in the differential diagnosis.

Criterion D

People with functional neurological symptoms may have substantial physical and
mental disability. The severity can be similar to that experienced by individuals with
comparable neurological disease. For example, the disability of individuals with
functional weakness is similar to that of individuals with multiple sclerosis of similar
duration, and the effect of pseudoseizures on social and occupational functioning is
similar to that experienced by people with epilepsy.

Specifiers

The clinician can choose to specify the patient’s predominant symptoms (e.g., “with
weakness or paralysis”), as well as course (acute episode or persistent), and whether
a psychological stressor is present or not.

Psychological Factors Affecting

Other Medical Conditions

The category currently called _psychological factors affecting other medical conditions_ has
a long history. DSM-I had detailed sections describing 10 _psychophysiologic auto-
nomic and visceral disorders_ (a term used in preference to _psychosomatic disorders_ ), each
involving a different organ system (e.g., skin, musculoskeletal, respiratory), in which
emotional factors were presumed to play a causative role. DSM-I stated, “These reac-
tions represent the visceral expression of affect which may be thereby largely pre-
vented from being conscious. These symptoms are due to a chronic and exaggerated
state of the normal physiological expression of emotion, with the feeling, or subjective
part, repressed. Such long continued visceral states may eventually lead to structural
changes” (p. 29).
The category continued in DSM-II mostly unchanged other than shortening the
term to _psychophysiologic disorder._ DSM-III revamped the concept to create a single cat-
egory called psychological factors affecting physical condition. The authors of DSM-
III noted that the diagnosis was rarely used and perpetuated the notion—since dis-
credited—that physical symptoms were caused by emotional factors. Also, the term
_psychophysiological_ was discarded because the decision about whether the condition
was psychophysiological or organic was arbitrary. The term was believed to decrease
collaboration between specialists and was thought to perpetuate simplistic ideas about
disease causation.
In DSM-III, psychological contributions to medical illness were integrated into the
new multiaxial system. The approach taken was that psychological factors may be as-


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **211**

sociated with the initiation or exacerbation of a physical disorder, which could be re-
corded on Axis III. However, “psychological factors affecting physical condition” was
considered a category, not a specific diagnosis. With DSM-IV, the authors chose to
move the category to the chapter “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical
Attention,” and it was no longer considered a mental disorder. To make the category
more useful, DSM-IV contained a subcategorization format that allowed clinicians to
specify the ways in which the psychological or behavioral factors could affect medical
conditions. For instance, the clinician could choose “personality traits or coping style
affecting.. .” and then specify the general medical condition involved. (For example,
a person could experience an exacerbation of his coronary artery disease because his
denial leads him to ignore warnings to minimize physical exertion.)
In DSM-5, this category has been moved to this chapter on somatic symptom and
related disorders to acknowledge the fact that somatic concerns are the main focus.
The criteria have had only minor wording changes. In DSM-IV, psychological factors af-
fecting medical condition had six subtypes. The subtypes were rarely used, however,
and have been eliminated.
Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions may be confused with
other DSM-5 categories that involve both psychological factors and medical symp-
toms. During differential diagnosis, the clinician should distinguish psychological
factors affecting other medical conditions from the somatic symptom disorders; for
example, with conversion disorder an individual may present with symptoms that
suggest a neurological condition and are related to psychological factors. Unlike in-
dividuals with psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, those with
somatic symptom disorders have no medical condition that adequately explains the
physical symptoms.
The essential feature of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is
the presence of one or more clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors
that adversely affect a medical condition by increasing the risk for suffering, death, or
disability. These factors can adversely affect the medical condition by influencing its
course or treatment, by constituting an additional health risk factor, or by exacerbat-
ing the physiology related to the medical condition. Psychological or behavioral fac-
tors include psychological distress, patterns of interpersonal interaction, coping
styles, and maladaptive help behaviors, such as denial of symptoms or poor adher-
ence to medical recommendations. Common examples are the person with anxiety
exacerbating his or her asthma, denial of the need for treatment of acute chest pain,
and manipulation of insulin by a person with diabetes wishing to lose weight. Cur-
rent severity can be indicated using a specifier.

Diagnostic Criteria for Psychological Factors Affecting
Other Medical Conditions **316 (F54)**

A. A medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is present.
B. Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition in one of
the following ways:


**212** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. The factors have influenced the course of the medical condition as shown by a
    close temporal association between the psychological factors and the develop-
    ment or exacerbation of, or delayed recovery from, the medical condition.
2. The factors interfere with the treatment of the medical condition (e.g., poor ad-
herence).
3. The factors constitute additional well-established health risks for the individual.
4. The factors influence the underlying pathophysiology, precipitating or exacer-
bating symptoms or necessitating medical attention.

C. The psychological and behavioral factors in Criterion B are not better explained by
another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder, major depressive disorder, posttrau-
matic stress disorder).

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Increases medical risk (e.g., inconsistent adherence with antihypertension
treatment).
**Moderate:** Aggravates underlying medical condition (e.g., anxiety aggravating
asthma).
**Severe:** Results in medical hospitalization or emergency room visit.
**Extreme:** Results in severe, life-threatening risk (e.g., ignoring heart attack
symptoms).

Criterion A

A medical symptom or condition other than a mental disorder must be present. As in
the past, this could involve a disorder from any organ system.

Criteria B and C

Criterion B has been edited but is otherwise unchanged. It lists the ways in which the
“psychological or behavioral factors” adversely affect the medical condition: this in-
cludes a clear-cut temporal relationship between these factors and the development
and exacerbation of, or recovery from, the medical condition. It is important to estab-
lish that the factors interfere with treatment, constitute a well-established health risk,
or influence the underlying physiology and pathophysiology to such an extent that
they precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or necessitate medical attention. Other men-
tal disorders need to be ruled out as a cause of the disturbance (Criterion C).

Specifiers

The clinician can indicate current severity indicators (mild, moderate, severe, or ex-
treme) that track to indicators of medical risk.

Factitious Disorder

Factitious disorder involves the intentional falsification of physical or psychological
signs or symptoms of illness, which in some cases leads the person to make hospital-


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **213**

ization a way of life. The term _Munchausen syndrome_ also has been used to describe
patients who move from hospital to hospital simulating various illnesses. Cases of
_Munchausen syndrome by proxy_ have also been observed. In this instance, a parent
induces (or simulates) illness in his or her child so that the child is repeatedly hospi-
talized. No reliable prevalence data are available, but factitious disorder is not un-
common.
Individuals are known to use various strategies to simulate illness. Some report
symptoms suggesting an illness without having them. Others produce false evidence
of an illness, such as a factitious fever produced by applying friction to a thermome-
ter, or intentionally produce symptoms of illness, such as by injecting feces to produce
infection. Factitious disorder is chronic and begins in early adulthood. Research evi-
dence suggests that many persons with factitious disorder worked in health care oc-
cupations, and many have severely maladaptive personality traits. The disorder can
severely impair social and occupational functioning.
The Somatic Symptoms Disorders Work Group recommended that factitious dis-
order be placed in the somatic symptom disorders chapter because physical symp-
toms are the main focus of concern. This placement should facilitate differential
diagnosis for individuals who present with persistent problems related to illness per-
ception, frequently including unexpected and/or unexplained psychological and/or
physical symptoms. This move may also facilitate research on the broad spectrum of
symptom-reporting phenomena, including the feigning of symptoms. The criteria
recognize factitious disorder imposed on self and factitious disorder imposed on an-
other (i.e., by proxy). The clinician can specify whether the disorder is a single episode
or is recurrent.

Diagnostic Criteria for Factitious Disorder **300.19 (F68.10)**

**Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self**

A. Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms, or induction of injury
or disease, associated with identified deception.
B. The individual presents himself or herself to others as ill, impaired, or injured.
C. The deceptive behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external re-
wards.
D. The behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as delusion-
al disorder or another psychotic disorder.

Specify:
**Single episode
Recurrent episodes** (two or more events of falsification of illness and/or induction of
injury)

**Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another
(Previously Factitious Disorder by Proxy)**

A. Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms, or induction of injury
or disease, in another, associated with identified deception.


**214** DSM-5 Guidebook

B. The individual presents another individual (victim) to others as ill, impaired, or in-
jured.
C. The deceptive behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external re-
wards.
D. The behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as delusion-
al disorder or another psychotic disorder.

**Note:** The perpetrator, not the victim, receives this diagnosis.

Specify:

Other Specified Somatic Symptom and Related

Disorder and Unspecified Somatic Symptom

and Related Disorder

Individuals whose somatic symptoms do not fit more specific diagnoses are diag-
nosed with other specified or unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder,
both of which replace DSM-IV’s somatoform disorder not otherwise specified.
The category other specified somatic symptom and related disorder is used when
the clinician chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet
full criteria. The clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., brief so-
matic symptom disorder).
The category unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder is used when the
individual does not meet full criteria for a more specific disorder that causes distress
or impairment and the clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not
met, or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Somatic Symptom and
Related Disorder **300.89 (F45.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a somatic
symptom and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the somatic symptom and related dis-
orders diagnostic class.
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Brief somatic symptom disorder:** Duration of symptoms is less than 6 months.
2. **Brief illness anxiety disorder:** Duration of symptoms is less than 6 months.
3. **Illness anxiety disorder without excessive health-related behaviors:** Criterion
    D for illness anxiety disorder is not met.


**_Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders_** **215**

4. **Pseudocyesis:** A false belief of being pregnant that is associated with objective
    signs and reported symptoms of pregnancy.

Unspecified Somatic Symptom and
Related Disorder **300.82 (F45.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a somatic
symptom and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the somatic symptom and related dis-
orders diagnostic class. The unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder cate-
gory should not be used unless there are decidedly unusual situations where there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

- Somatic symptom and related disorders is a reformulated diagnostic class that
    replaces the somatoform disorders. The key element is that all disorders focus
    on physical symptoms and/or excessive health-related concerns. The class em-
    phasizes affective, cognitive, and behavioral features of the disorders rather
    than focusing on physical symptoms.
- Somatic symptom disorder is a new diagnosis that replaces DSM-IV’s somati-
    zation disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and undifferentiated somato-
    form disorder. The DSM-IV diagnoses were not well used, were considered
    pejorative, and did not foster positive doctor-patient interactions.
- Illness anxiety disorder is new to DSM-5 and is used to describe a preoccupation
    with having or acquiring a serious illness.
- Body dysmorphic disorder has been moved to a new chapter, “Obsessive-Com-
    pulsive and Related Disorders,” based on research evidence showing its related-
    ness to obsessive-compulsive disorder.
- Factitious disorder and psychological factors affecting other medical conditions
    have been moved to this diagnostic class because of their central focus on phys-
    ical symptoms.
