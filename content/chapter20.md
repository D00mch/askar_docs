Level 1 and Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures
Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity
World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0
Cultural Formulation Interview

## Section III of DSM-5, “Emerging Measures and Models,” includes new

assessments and models that can be used by clinicians and researchers to provide a
more thorough evaluation of the patient. The measures and models, all of which are
optional, include the Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure, a list of Level 2 Cross-
Cutting Symptom Measures, the Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom
Severity scale, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0
(WHODAS 2.0). Level 2 severity measures are available online and may be used to ex-
plore significant responses to the Level 1 screen. The Cultural Formulation Interview,
a comprehensive review of the cultural context of mental disorders, is also provided.
The authors of DSM-5 aimed to integrate dimensional measures into the manual. The
goal was to enhance the assessment of symptom variation and severity, enabling the cli-
nician to provide a more complete evaluation of the patient to assist with treatment deci-
sions and in monitoring outcome. The goal was largely achieved with regard to several
major categories. For example, intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disor-
der) no longer is linked to specific IQ ranges; rather, the diagnosis depends on a dimen-
sional assessment of adaptive functioning, which is anchored to conceptual, social, and
practical domains (see Chapter 3, “Neurodevelopmental Disorders,” of this guidebook).
Another example is the decision to merge substance abuse and dependence into a single
“use” disorder rated according to severity, which ranges from mild (two to three symp-
toms) to severe (six or more symptoms). The most ambitious plan to incorporate di-
mensions was developed by the Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group.
Although their hybrid categorical-dimensional diagnostic system was not accepted for
inclusion in Section II, the scheme is included in Section III (and described in Chapter 21,
“Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders,” of this guidebook). Thus, DSM-5
places greater emphasis on dimensional measures compared with its predecessors, yet
categorical diagnosis remains its fundamental goal.

Level 1 and Level 2 Cross-Cutting

Symptom Measures

Cross-cutting symptom measures can serve as an approach for reviewing important
psychopathological domains, and they function as the equivalent of general medicine’s
review of systems. ( _Cross-cutting_ refers to the measure “cutting across” various psy-
chopathological domains.) A similar review of various mental functions can provide
a more complete mental status evaluation by drawing attention to symptoms that
may not be suggested by the individual’s presenting symptoms but are important to
the individual’s care. In DSM-5, cross-cutting measures have two levels: Level 1 ques-
tions are a brief survey of 13 symptom domains for adult patients and 12 domains for
child and adolescent patients. Level 2 questions provide a more in-depth assessment
of certain domains. The measures were developed to be administered initially and over
time to track the patient’s symptoms and treatment response.
New to DSM-5 is the Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. This patient- or in-
formant-rated measure can be used to assess mental health domains that are important
across psychiatric diagnoses. The adult version has 23 questions that assess 13 domains:
depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis,
sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality
functioning, and substance use. Each domain consists of one to three questions. Each
item inquires about how much (or how often) the individual has been bothered by the
specific symptoms during the past 2 weeks. The measure was found to be clinically
useful and to have good reliability in the DSM-5 field trials. A similar instrument for
children ages 6–17 years consisting of 25 questions assessing 12 psychiatric domains was
tested and found to have good reliability. The adult version of the measure is included
on the following pages and, along with the analogous child measure, is available at
[http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.](http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.)
Achieving threshold scores on the Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure can
indicate a need for a more detailed inquiry. Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures
can provide one way of obtaining more in-depth information on potentially signifi-
cant symptoms to inform diagnosis and treatment planning. These measures are
available online at [http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.](http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.) They include well-validated measures
such as the Patient Health Questionnaire 15-Item Somatic Symptom Severity Scale
and the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Severity Scale.

Clinician-Rated Dimensions of

Psychosis Symptom Severity

Because psychotic disorders are heterogeneous and symptom severity can predict im-
portant aspects of the illness, dimensional assessments can help capture meaningful
variation in symptom presentations. This can help with treatment planning, prognos-
tic decision-making, and research on pathophysiological mechanisms. The Clinician-
Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity can be used in the dimensional as-
sessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations, delusions,
and disorganized speech. The scale also assesses depression and mania. This eight-item
measure can be completed by the clinician or researcher at the time of assessment.
Each symptom is rated for current severity (past 7 days) on a 5-point scale (0: “Not
present” to 4: “Present and severe”). The scale can be used to rate any of the psychotic
disorders. The time frame is the past 7 days. The scale is shown below.

Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0

The adult self-administered version of the World Health Organization Disability As-
sessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) is a 36-item measure that assesses disability in
adults age 18 years and older. Six domains are assessed: understanding and communi-
cation; getting around; self-care; getting along with people; life activities (e.g., house-
hold activities); and participation in society. If the person is unable to complete the
form, a knowledgeable informant may complete the proxy-administered version. Both
are available at [http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.](http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.) Each version asks the individual to rate
how much difficulty he or she has had in the specific areas in the past 30 days.
There are two options for scoring. In a simple version of scoring, the scores assigned
to each item (none = 1, mild = 2, moderate = 3, severe = 4, and extreme = 5) are summed.
There is no weighting of individual items. A more complex scoring method, called
“item-response-theory”–based scoring, takes into account multiple levels of difficulty
for each item. A computer program is available from the World Health Organization
Web site. The authors of DSM-5, in part on the basis of the findings from field trials in
adult samples, recommend the calculation and use of average scores for each domain
(e.g., understanding and communication) and for general disability. These scores were
found to be reliable and clinically useful to the clinicians participating in the field trials.
The average domain score is calculated by dividing the raw domain score by the num-
ber of items in the domain. The average general disability score is calculated by divid-
ing the raw overall score by the number of items in the measure (i.e., 36). The measure
may be repeated at regular intervals to track change in the individual’s level of disabil-
ity over time. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant
and problematic areas for the individual that might warrant further assessment and in-
tervention.

Cultural Formulation Interview

The Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) consists of 16 questions clinicians can use
to obtain information about the impact of a patient’s culture on key aspects of care. In
the CFI, _culture_ refers primarily to the values, orientations, and assumptions that in-
dividuals derive from membership in diverse social groups (e.g., ethnic groups, the
military, faith communities), which may conform or differ from medical explanations.
The term _culture_ also refers to aspects of a person’s background that may affect his or
her perspective, such as ethnicity, race, language, or religion.
The CFI focuses on the patient’s perspectives on the problem, the role of others in
influencing the course of the problem, the impact of the patient’s cultural back-
ground, the patient’s help-seeking experiences, and current expectations about treat-
ment and other forms of care. The CFI follows a person-centered approach to cultural
assessment by asking the patient to address these topics on the basis of his or her own
views rather than inquiring about the views of the person’s cultural group(s) of ori-
gin. This is intended to avoid stereotyping, as individuals vary substantially in how
they combine and interpret cultural information and perspectives. Because the CFI
concerns the patient’s views, there are no right or wrong answers. The interview is avail-
able online at [http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.](http://www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.)
The CFI can be used at the beginning of an initial assessment interview with all
adult patients in all clinical settings, regardless of the patient’s background or that of
the clinician. Patients and clinicians who appear to share the same cultural back-
ground may in fact differ on a number of perspectives relevant to care. Alternatively,
individual questions may be used at any point in the interview, as necessary. During
later stages in care, the CFI may be particularly helpful when there is difficulty in
making a diagnostic judgment, owing to a significant difference in cultural, religious,
or socioeconomic background of clinician and patient; when there is uncertainty about
the match between culturally expressed symptoms and diagnostic criteria; when it is
difficult to make a dimensional judgment of severity; when patients and clinicians
disagree on the course of treatment; or in cases of limited engagement and adherence.
This interview process and the information it elicits are expected to enhance the cul-
tural validity of the diagnostic assessment, facilitate treatment planning, and promote
patient engagement and satisfaction.
The CFI emphasizes four main domains:

1. **Cultural Definition of the Problem:** The presenting issues that led to the current
    illness episode, cast within the patient’s worldview. In this section, the patient de-
    scribes the problem and focuses on its most troubling aspects. This information starts
    to address what is most at stake for the patient with respect to the current presen-
    tation, including nonmedical aspects.
2. **Cultural Perceptions of Cause, Context, and Support:** The patient’s explanations
    for the circumstances of illness, including the cause of the problem. The patient
    also clarifies factors that improve or worsen the problem, with particular attention
    to the role of family, friends, and cultural background. The clinician seeks to obtain
    a holistic picture of the patient in his or her social environment with emphasis on
    how cultural elements affect the presentation.


**444** DSM-5 Guidebook

3. **Cultural Factors Affecting Self-Coping and Past Help Seeking:** The strategies
    employed by the patient to improve the situation, including those that have been
    most and least helpful. The patient also identifies past barriers to care. This infor-
    mation helps clarify the patient’s perspective on the nature of the problem, his or
    her mental health treatment expectations as opposed to expectations regarding
    other forms of help, and current resources to address the situation.
4. **Cultural Factors Affecting Current Help Seeking:** The patient’s perception of the
    relationship with the clinician, current potential treatment barriers, and prefer-
    ences for care. In this section, the patient specifies how the clinician may facilitate
    current treatment and what may interfere with the clinical relationship. Treatment
    preferences are elicited that may be incorporated into the treatment plan.

Supplementary modules have been developed that expand each domain of the CFI
and may help guide clinicians who wish to probe these domains in greater depth. Sup-
plementary modules have also been developed for populations with unique needs,
such as children and adolescents, elderly patients, and immigrants and refugees.
