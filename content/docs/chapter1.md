# CHAPTER 1

## The March to DSM-5

###### 1

## The process to develop DSM-5 (called DSM-V during much of its

development) began in 1999, five years after the publication of DSM-IV. Steven E.
Hyman, M.D., then director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Ste-
ven M. Mirin, M.D., then president of the American Psychiatric Association (APA),
and David J. Kupfer, M.D., who chaired the APA Committee on Psychiatric Diagnosis
and Assessment, met and agreed that the APA and NIMH should work together to
expand the scientific basis for psychiatric diagnosis and classification.
As described by Regier et al. (2011), issues included

1. The basic definition of mental illness.
2. The option of adding dimensional criteria to disorders.
3. The possible separation of impairment and diagnostic assessments.
4. The need to address various expressions of an illness across the life span.
5. The need to address various expressions of mental disorders as conditioned by
    gender and culture.

A conference was convened later that year, cosponsored by both organizations, to
develop research priorities. Participants included experts in epidemiology and genet-
ics, neuroscience, cognitive and behavioral science, child and adult development, and
disability assessment. To encourage thinking “outside the box,” those closely involved
in the development of DSM-IV were not included. Participants recognized the need for
a series of white papers to guide future research and promote further discussion cov-
ering overarching topic areas that cut across many psychiatric disorders. Work groups
were created for developmental issues, gaps in the current diagnostic system, disabil-
ity and impairment, neuroscience, nomenclature, and cross-cultural issues.
Darrel A. Regier, M.D., M.P.H., was recruited from NIMH in 2000 to serve as direc-
tor of the APA’s American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education (APIRE)
and to coordinate the development of DSM-5. Additional conferences were held to set
the DSM-5 research agenda, to propose planning work group membership, and to
hold face-to-face meetings. These groups, which included liaisons from the National


**2** DSM-5 Guidebook

Institutes of Health (NIH) and the international psychiatric community, developed a
series of white papers, published in _A Research Agenda for DSM-V_ (Kupfer et al. 2002).
A second series of white papers, titled _Age and Gender Considerations in Psychiatric
Diagnosis,_ was later commissioned by the APA and published in 2007 (Narrow et al.
2007).
In 2002, APIRE and Director Regier worked with leaders of the World Health Or-
ganization (WHO) and the World Psychiatric Association to develop a grant from
NIMH to implement a series of research planning conferences that aimed to focus on
the scientific evidence for revisions of specific diagnostic areas. With Regier as prin-
cipal investigator, a $1.1 million cooperative agreement grant was awarded with joint
support from NIMH, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
The multiyear grant (2003–2008) supported 13 international conferences. For each,
participants wrote papers addressing specific diagnostic questions, and from these
papers and conference proceedings a research agenda was developed. More than 100
scientific articles were written that were later compiled into monographs. A consis-
tent recommendation was the need for better integration of categorical and dimen-
sional assessment criteria (Helzer et al. 2008). DSM-IV Task Force members had con-
sidered the feasibility of using dimensional measures to assess disorder thresholds
and rate severity. Instead, language regarding “clinically significant distress or im-
pairment” was incorporated into DSM-IV for all disorders, but the only dimensional
component consisted of Axis V (of the multiaxial diagnostic scheme), which provided
for the assessment of global functioning.
The DSM-5 Task Force was created in 2006 by APA President Steven S. Sharfstein,
M.D., and APA Medical Director James H. Scully Jr., M.D., with Dr. Kupfer as chair and
Dr. Regier as vice-chair. Additional members were appointed to the task force, includ-
ing the chairs of the 13 diagnostic work groups that were responsible for reviewing
the research and literature on which to base their recommendations.
The APA Board of Trustees established principles of appointment that required
limits on investments and income that could be received from the pharmaceutical in-
dustry, mandated that no more than two representatives from any university could
participate in the task force or in the same work group, and required a vetting and
review process by a subcommittee of the board. Work group chairs, together with
Drs. Kupfer and Regier, recommended to the successive APA presidents (Drs. Pedro
Ruiz and Carolyn Robinowitz) nominees viewed as leading experts in their field. Task
force members were announced in July 2007 and work group members in May 2008.
The DSM-5 Task Force had four guiding principles:

1. Give priority to clinical utility; that is, any changes to the criteria or organization
    of the manual had to be useful to clinicians.
2. Use research evidence accumulated since the publication of DSM-IV as a guide for
    making changes.
3. Maintain historical continuity with previous editions, particularly DSM-III and
    DSM-IV.
4. Do not establish a priori any limits on changes proposed by work groups.


**_The March to DSM-5_** **3**

Task force members respected precedent and understood that any changes to the
manual would potentially affect clinical care, disorder prevalence, research protocols,
and coding and billing practices. Diagnostic advances would be made through a care-
ful and transparent process involving detailed literature reviews, secondary analyses
of existing data sets, and primary analyses of newly collected data.
The task force was assigned the responsibility of addressing conceptual issues
through six study groups (distinct from the work groups), each delegated to guide the
overall development of revisions for one of the following specific diagnostic areas:

1. _Diagnostic spectra and DSM/ICD harmonization:_ This group assessed the spectra of
    syndromes across existing diagnostic boundaries, made recommendations for the
    overall structure of DSM categories, and identified 11 potential criteria for testing
    the validity of mental disorder diagnoses, representing an expansion beyond the
    original five validating criteria proposed by Robins and Guze (1970).
2. _Life span developmental approaches:_ This group focused on the different expressions
    of mental disorders that might emerge at progressive ages in human developmen-
    tal life stages.
3. _Gender and cross-cultural issues:_ This group was established to assess the different
    expression of symptom equivalence of mental disorders mediated by gender and
    culture.
4. _Psychiatric/general medical interface:_ This group was formed to address approaches
    that would facilitate a better interface between general medical and mental disor-
    der approaches to diagnosis.
5. _Impairment and disability:_ This group was formed to address the development of
    global impairment and disability assessment strategies.
6. _Diagnostic assessment instruments:_ This group considered the need to address mea-
    surement and assessment issues.

Last, a seventh study group was established to review secondary data analyses pro-
posed for funding by the APA to assess the evidence base for proposed revisions.
Work groups met regularly via conference calls and convened in person twice an-
nually. An initial task for the groups was to address how DSM-IV did or did not work
well or otherwise failed to meet clinicians’ needs. For example, work groups evalu-
ated how to better assess symptom severity and how to handle the problem of multi-
ple comorbidities. Other aims included reducing “not otherwise specified” diagnoses
(seen as overused and problematic) and improving diagnostic criteria that lacked
precision. The work groups also aimed to better specify treatment targets to help cli-
nicians identify symptoms that could be addressed in treatment. Additionally, the
DSM-5 Task Force focused on how best to include assessment of common symptoms
not addressed within the diagnostic criteria for a specific illness (e.g., symptoms of in-
somnia that may be experienced by a patient with schizophrenia).
In addition, the work groups were asked to do the following:

1. Clarify the boundaries between mental disorders to reduce confusion of disorders
    with each other and to help guide effective treatment


**4** DSM-5 Guidebook

2. Consider “cross-cutting” symptoms (those that commonly occur across different
    diagnoses)
3. Demonstrate the strength of research for the recommendations on as many evi-
    dence levels as possible
4. Clarify the boundaries between specific mental disorders and normal psycholog-
    ical functioning

Revisions to the diagnostic criteria were developed by each work group based on
a review of research evidence, targeted data analyses, and expert consensus. Summa-
ries of major work group issues were posted on the DSM-5 developmental Web site,
and comments from public and professional colleagues were sought. The final phase
of DSM-5 development included interactions between the study groups and the di-
agnostic work groups.
One goal was to establish a framework for an evolution of the diagnostic system
that would advance clinical practice and facilitate ongoing testing of the diagnostic
criteria. The task force concluded that an important advance would be to incorporate
simple dimensional measures for assessing syndromes both within and across broad
diagnostic categories (Regier 2007).

DSM-V or DSM-5?

One goal of the task force was to designate DSM-5 as a “living” document, meaning
that future changes could be made rapidly in response to scientific advances. Task
force members concluded that the ability to respond in a rapid and nimble fashion
was best captured by the use of the Arabic numeral rather than the Roman numerals
that have been used since DSM-II was published in 1968—hence, DSM-5 rather than
DSM-V. Because technology allows immediate dissemination of information world-
wide, Roman numerals were considered too limiting, especially considering that fu-
ture text revisions appeared likely. For example, a “TR” designation (as in DSM-IV-
TR) can only be applied once. For simplicity, future changes prior to the manual’s next
complete revision can be designated as DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2, and so forth.

Dimensional Assessment

A challenge in accurately diagnosing mental disorders is having the ability to fully
assess a range of symptoms and other factors in patients. Since DSM-III, disorders
have been described and arranged by category, with a specific list of criteria for each
mental disorder. With this categorical system, a person either had a symptom or did
not, and having a certain number of symptoms was required for a diagnosis to be
made. If this number was not met, the disorder was not diagnosed.
The use of criteria represented a vast improvement over the previous guidelines
available to diagnose patients with mental disorders, but categorical approaches do
not always fit with the reality of the range of symptoms that people experience. For
example, persons with schizophrenia often have other symptoms that do not fit the
criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia (e.g., depression, anxiety). Because diagnostic


**_The March to DSM-5_** **5**

criteria require a yes/no decision by the clinician, in most cases there is no method in
DSM-IV to account for the severity of the disorder, nor an easy way to determine if
the patient is improving with treatment.
Work groups were asked to consider ways to incorporate a simple method to en-
able clinicians to capture the symptoms and severity of mental disorders with dimen-
sional measures that would allow clinicians to systematically evaluate patients on a
full range of symptoms. Dimensional assessments allow clinicians to rate the pres-
ence and the severity of the symptoms (e.g., as _very severe, severe, moderate,_ or _mild_ ).
This rating can be used to track a patient’s progress with treatment and can serve as
a means to note improvements even when symptoms remain. Work groups also were
asked to examine the available scientific evidence and determine appropriate dimen-
sional assessments for the specific illnesses under review, and provide clinicians with
specific guidance on their use. Dimensional assessments are discussed in Chapter 20,
“Assessment Measures.”

Diagnostic Reliability and Field Trials

DSM-5 Task Force members understood the need for diagnostic reliability. _Reliability_
refers to the certainty with which it can be predicted that different clinicians will ap-
ply the same diagnosis to the same patient. While diagnostic reliability is rarely if ever
absolute in any field of medicine, it has enormous importance. If two clinicians give
a patient two different diagnoses, one of them is probably wrong. Methods of testing
reliability were developed for DSM-5 to give a more accurate picture of real-world
clinical reliability than did field trials for previous editions (Kraemer et al. 2010, 2012).
Reliability was assessed through a series of field trials; the process included the ex-
amination of specific diagnostic criteria as well as overarching changes applicable
across disorders, such as the integration of dimensional measures and diagnostic se-
verity scales.
The field trials utilized two designs. In the first, a large-scale design implemented
across 11 academic medical centers, approximately 2,000 patients were seen. In the
second design, which was created for solo and small group clinicians in routine clinical
practice settings, around 1,450 patients were seen. The designs provided an opportu-
nity to examine the reliability, clinical utility, and feasibility of proposed changes both
in high-volume research practice settings and in everyday clinical care settings. Diag-
nostic interviews were conducted by psychiatrists and other mental health practi-
tioners, all of whom were expected to use the manual in their daily care of patients.
Interviews were naturalistic and did not employ structured interviews, in order to
replicate what clinicians do every day.
In field trials for prior editions of DSM, the main method used to measure reliabil-
ity was _interrater testing,_ in which two or more raters review the same patient material
at the same time. The design accounts for the “noise” of clinical inconsistency but
does not account for differences in the way patients with the same condition may
present or the fact that the same patient can present differently on different days. For
that reason, interrater reliability testing is likely to render a score that may not reflect
clinical reality. _Test-retest reliability_ was examined in the DSM-5 field trials. This design


**6** DSM-5 Guidebook

requires that the same patients be observed separately by two or more raters within
an interval during which the clinical condition of the patients is unlikely to have
changed, and a kappa statistic is calculated.
Innovations of the field trials included random patient selection with few exclu-
sion criteria; use of clinicians not selected on the basis of special expertise in the dis-
orders being evaluated; application of the entire DSM-5 system in each evaluation
(rather than focusing on one diagnosis at a time); and instructions to participating cli-
nicians that they make diagnoses according to their usual practice, not on the basis of
a standardized diagnostic interview (rarely used in clinical practice). These changes
were made to test with optimal fidelity diagnostic criteria intended for real-world cli-
nicians treating real patients.
Preliminary results of the field trials were presented at the 2012 American Psychi-
atric Association annual meeting. DSM-5 criteria were at least adequately reliable for
most of the disorder studies, while dimensional ratings fared better. Kappa values
from tests conducted in the academic centers were in the “excellent” range for the fol-
lowing: autism spectrum disorder, 0.69; posttraumatic stress disorder, 0.67; attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 0.61; and major neurocognitive disorder, 0.78. The fol-
lowing disorders were in the “good” range: bipolar I disorder, 0.54; schizophrenia,
0.46; schizoaffective disorder, 0.50; mild traumatic brain injury, 0.46; and borderline
personality disorder, 0.58. Other disorders fared less well: generalized anxiety dis-
order, 0.20, and major depressive disorder, 0.32. Although attenuated psychosis
syndrome fared reasonably well (0.46), the 95% confidence interval extended to zero,
suggesting a failed trial.
Although kappa values reported for DSM-III and DSM-IV were better (e.g., 0.59
for major depressive disorder), patient samples were very different in those earlier
field trials in that patients with psychiatric comorbidities had been excluded.

Final Approval

The proposed revisions to DSM-5 had a rigorous and multistage review prior to final
approval by the APA Board of Trustees. Throughout 2011 and 2012, proposed changes
continued to undergo revision with input from APA members and others via three
postings on the DSM-5 developmental Web site. Field trial data was analyzed, dis-
cussed, and integrated into proposals during the review process. A scientific review
committee was charged with reviewing the science validating the evidence for revi-
sions. A peer review process took place in which hundreds of expert reviewers con-
sidered the clinical and public health risks and benefits of making changes from
DSM-IV. The APA Assembly, its governing body, debated DSM-5 and voted to ap-
prove the new manual at their annual fall meeting in November 2012.
Last, there was an overall review by the DSM-5 Task Force, which sent final rec-
ommendations along with all supporting data to the APA’s Board of Trustees for a fi-
nal review. The final draft was approved by the board in December 2012 and
thereafter submitted to American Psychiatric Publishing, a division of the APA. The
official release of DSM-5 was set for the 166th Annual Meeting of the APA in San
Francisco, May 18–22, 2013.

Controversies Involving DSM-5

The revision process was not without controversy, but this must be placed in perspec-
tive: all prior DSM editions were accompanied by considerable public consternation,
and DSM-5 was no exception. A steady drumbeat of criticism began early, both within
the field and among the public at large.
The main concerns from various critics were that the DSM-5 process lacked open-
ness and transparency; that decisions were made capriciously and did not follow the
evidence; that no independent scientific review was done; that rates of reliability
were unacceptably low; that prevalence rates would increase because the thresholds
for important categories (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mild neuro-
cognitive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder) were too loose; and that
many task force and work group members had conflicts of interest.
Allegations of conflict of interest were spurred in part by an article in an online
journal that implied that the DSM-5 financial disclosure policy had not resulted in a
reduction of conflicts (Cosgrove and Krimsky 2012). The article drew comparisons
with the DSM-IV process (for which there were few stringent requirements to dis-
close) and suggested there was an increase in conflicts among DSM-5 Task Force and
work group members. The APA responded that the data show 72% of task force and
work group members had no relationship with the pharmaceutical industry in 2011.
Of the remaining 28%, 12% reported grant support only, 10% reported paid consulta-
tions, and 7% reported receiving honoraria.
Several diagnostic categories received special criticism. One major concern was
the introduction of the autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, in which five DSM-IV-TR
diagnoses (autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder,
Rett’s disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) were
consolidated. Interest groups led by those wanting to preserve Asperger ’s disorder
were concerned new criteria would relegate individuals with this disorder to the di-
agnostic hinterlands. The decision to remove the “bereavement exclusion” for major
depressive disorder was criticized by persons who claimed the change would turn
normal bereavement into a mental disorder. The DSM-5 attenuated psychosis syn-
drome was harshly criticized by some who were motivated by the concern that the
diagnosis would unfairly stigmatize persons for no reason other than that they might
be considered odd by others or because of their family history, and that it is not pos-
sible to reliably identify persons likely to develop psychosis; furthermore, because
there are no proven treatments for the proposed disorder, the diagnosis would merely
increase off-label use of antipsychotics in a futile attempt to treat it. (The Psychotic
Disorders Work Group later recommended placing attenuated psychosis syndrome
in Section III, “Conditions for Further Study.”) Likewise, disruptive mood dysregula-
tion disorder was criticized for labeling irritable children with a mental disorder that
would also increase off-label use of antipsychotics.
Finally, special fire was reserved for the entire personality disorders chapter (fur-
ther discussed in Chapter 18). In addition to recommending that the number of dis-
orders be reduced from 10 to 6, the Personality and Personality Disorders Work
Group recommended revamping the diagnostic criteria for the remaining disorders,


**8** DSM-5 Guidebook

while incorporating a complex scheme to rate up to five personality trait domains and
25 facets. Critics pointed out that the new criteria were so complex as to be unwork-
able for busy clinicians, and that an already marginalized group of patients would
only be further marginalized by clinicians who ignored the new criteria. The fact that
two work group members resigned in 2012 further fueled the fire. In the end, the APA
Board of Trustees voted to include the DSM-IV personality disorder criteria in Section
II and place the proposed model in Section III.
Despite these many challenges, the task force and 13 work groups pressed on, and,
although the initial timetable could not be followed (the initial plan was for release in
2012), DSM-5 emerged hale and hearty, and probably much improved because of the
intense interest (and input) from clinicians and researchers, as well as the public.

Summary

The process that led to DSM-5 began 14 years ago, and was very much like the process
that led to its predecessors—DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV—by involving the ac-
tive participation of psychiatric leaders and of hundreds of practicing psychiatrists
and psychologists. The process was labor intensive, was open and transparent, and
had multiple layers of review. The task force had declared from the outset that DSM-5
should be transformative, and it held forth on that pledge, creating a 947-page docu-
ment (not including the classification listing and preface) that has introduced dimen-
sional assessment in a more fundamental way than its predecessors, has introduced
many new diagnoses, has consolidated many others, and has eliminated some. To the
extent possible, changes were based on the best scientific evidence, analyses of exist-
ing databases, and new data from field trials.
