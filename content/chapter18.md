## Maladaptive character traits have been recognized for millennia.

Formal attempts to list the variety of personality types took root with DSM-I, in which
eight different types of personality disorders were enumerated. The list was expanded
to 10 in DSM-II. In these early manuals, the disorders were briefly described but there
were no criteria—for example, inadequate personality in DSM-II: “The behavior pat-
tern is characterized by ineffectual responses to emotional, social, intellectual and
physical demands. While the patient seems neither physically nor mentally deficient,


**390** DSM-5 Guidebook

he does manifest inadaptability, ineptness, poor judgment, social instability, and lack
of physical and emotional stamina” (American Psychiatric Association 1968, p. 44).
In DSM-III, personality disorders were accorded new prominence by being coded
on a separate axis (Axis II) in the new multiaxial system. Criteria for 11 different per-
sonality disorders were included, some retained from DSM-II and others newly cre-
ated in response to clinical and research observations (e.g., schizotypal personality
disorder, borderline personality disorder). DSM-III also introduced the concept of per-
sonality disorder “clusters,” in which disorder types were grouped by their predomi-
nant symptom pattern: Cluster A for individuals considered odd or eccentric; Cluster B
for individuals considered dramatic, emotional, or erratic; and Cluster C for individ-
uals considered anxious or dependent.
In DSM-III-R and DSM-IV, the personality disorder diagnostic criteria were edited
for clarity and in some cases simplified. The number of disorders was pared down to
10 in DSM-IV with the elimination of passive-aggressive personality disorder, which
was thought to be insufficiently distinct.
During the development of DSM-5, the Personality and Personality Disorders Work
Group developed a model that combined categorical diagnosis with optional dimen-
sional ratings. Work group members had responded to the call by the DSM-5 Task Force
to introduce dimensional measures that could be used to assess symptoms and syn-
dromes and provide a more complete evaluation of an individual’s disorder and level
of functioning (Widiger et al. 2006) (See Chapter 1, “The March to DSM-5”).
The work group recommended reducing the number of personality disorders to six
by eliminating the dependent, histrionic, paranoid, and schizoid types; reformulating
the diagnostic criteria for the remaining disorders to emphasize personality function-
ing and maladaptive personality traits; and describing five broad personality domains
and 25 specific trait facets that could be dimensionally rated. The proposal received
much criticism, in part because of its complexity and the perception that it would be
overly time consuming for clinicians (Gunderson 2010). In December 2012, the Ameri-
can Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees voted to move the new scheme to Section
III in DSM-5 and to include the 10 specific DSM-IV personality disorders in Section II.
Thus, both versions are available to serve clinical practice and research initiatives (see
Chapter 21, “Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders”).
There are several changes to highlight in the class. Perhaps the most important
change is that the multiaxial evaluation system has been discontinued, and for that
reason personality disorders are no longer coded on Axis II. The decision to discontinue
the multiaxial system was largely due to its incompatibility with diagnostic systems
in the rest of medicine, but there were other motivations as well. The scheme had been
developed for DSM-III to help ensure that personality disorders and intellectual dis-
ability would receive greater recognition. An unintended consequence of placing per-
sonality disorders on an axis separate from the major disorders was to further
marginalize them. Personality disorders are now coded at the same level as other
mental disorders.
Next, the diagnosis personality disorder not otherwise specified has been re-
placed by other specified personality disorder and unspecified personality disorder.
These two diagnostic categories are used in situations in which the individual’s per-


**_Personality Disorders_** **391**

sonality pattern meets general criteria for a personality disorder and traits of several
different personality disorders are present but the criteria for any specific disorder are
not met (e.g., the individual is considered to have a personality disorder that is not
included in DSM-5, such as inadequate personality disorder). The unspecified per-
sonality disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific personality disorder and
when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.
Personality change due to another medical condition has been moved to this chapter
from DSM-IV’s “Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition.” The purpose
of this change was to place the diagnosis within the class relevant to the predominant
symptom pattern.
Additional changes to the class were prompted by discussions about the etiologi-
cal relationship among disorders. Schizotypal personality disorder has been listed
with the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, and antisocial per-
sonality disorder with the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders. The
text and criteria for these two disorders remain in the personality disorders chapter.

GENERAL PERSONALITY DISORDER

DSM-IV introduced a general set of criteria for personality disorders that has not
changed in DSM-5 except for minor edits. They address the question of whether or
not an individual has a personality disorder. If present, the clinician should determine
which of the ten specific disorders is present (the person’s presentation may meet the
criteria for more than one disorder). If the person’s presentation meets the general di-
agnostic criteria but the criteria for any of the specific disorders are not met, then the
diagnosis of either other specified personality disorder or unspecified personality dis-
order should be used.
The personality disorders continue to be grouped into three clusters on the basis
of their descriptive similarity: Cluster A includes paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal
personality disorders. People with these disorders may appear odd or eccentric. Clus-
ter B includes antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders.
Individuals with these disorders may appear dramatic, emotional, or erratic. Cluster C
includes avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Indi-
viduals with these disorders may appear anxious or fearful. The ten personality disor-
ders are described later in this chapter.

Diagnostic Criteria for General Personality Disorder

A. An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from
the expectations of the individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or
more) of the following areas:

1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events).
2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional
response).


**392** DSM-5 Guidebook

3. Interpersonal functioning.
4. Impulse control.

B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal
and social situations.
C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least
to adolescence or early adulthood.
E. The enduring pattern is not better explained as a manifestation or consequence of
another mental disorder.
F. The enduring pattern is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance
(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma).

Criterion A

This item ensures that the “pattern of inner experience” meets several conditions.
First, the pattern is enduring and not transient. If it is of recent onset or is transient, it
may well be attributable to another mental or medical disorder. Next, the pattern de-
viates “markedly” from the expectations of the individual’s culture. This is a necessary
and important distinction because some cultures encourage or tolerate individual ex-
pressions not tolerated in another culture. For example, in some non-Western societ-
ies the concepts of possession and magical experience are celebrated; in Western
societies, these symptoms may be used to indicate a Cluster A personality disorder
(e.g., schizotypal personality disorder).
The pattern must be manifested in two or more of four areas: cognition, affectivity,
interpersonal functioning, and impulse control. This requirement means that the in-
dividual’s symptoms or behaviors are not confined to a single domain. Typically,
most individuals who meet criteria for a personality disorder have involvement in
multiple symptom domains. For example, an individual with borderline personality
disorder may have problems maintaining stable interpersonal relationships, have ex-
treme difficulty regulating his or her emotions, have poor impulse control, and com-
mit acts of self-harm.

Criteria B, C, and D

These criteria ensure that the pattern is “pervasive across a broad range of personal
and social situations,” is impairing, and is stable and enduring. In short, the person-
ality difficulties are not confined to a single domain of functioning but affect most life
domains (home, school, workplace). For example, the individual may have problems
interacting not just with immediate family but with coworkers, friends and acquain-
tances, and even strangers. As might be expected, these problems are upsetting and
distressing to individuals, even though they may be unaware of their own role in cre-
ating difficulties for themselves. Their personality disorder can prevent the formation
or maintenance of stable interpersonal relationships, can contribute to job loss, and


**_Personality Disorders_** **393**

can contribute to overall unhappiness. Impairment occurs along a continuum as with
most mental disorders. At the extreme end, the person may be unable to function
without assistance because of near constant self-harm (borderline personality disor-
der) or because of uncontrolled criminal conduct that leads to incarceration (anti-
social personality disorder). At the milder end, a person may function well in the
workplace but be unable to maintain romantic attachments because of his or her ri-
gidity and stubbornness (obsessive-compulsive personality disorder).
Criterion D requires that the pattern be stable and of long duration. A personality
disorder is not considered time-limited or transitory. This requirement appears true
for most individuals whose personality disorder is evident by late adolescence or
early adulthood. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder have an even earlier
onset, with behavioral problems having an onset prior to age 15 years (diagnosed in
youth as conduct disorder). As a general rule, personality disorders tend to lessen in
severity (or “burn out”) with age. Longitudinal studies have shown, for instance, that
persons with antisocial and borderline personality disorders have progressively fewer
symptoms over time. At follow-up many will no longer meet full diagnostic criteria,
yet symptoms remain that can nonetheless be impairing. This may be less true for other
personality disorder types, such as obsessive-compulsive and schizotypal personal-
ity disorders. Further, because the problems associated with personality disorders
tend to be at their most severe during formative periods in a person’s life—when most
people are completing their education, marrying and starting a family, and establish-
ing a career—even when improved, many individuals with personality disorders
never “catch up” educationally, socially, or economically with their peers who do not
have personality disorders.

Criteria E and F

These are the “rule out” criteria meant to ensure that the clinician has ruled out other
potential causes for the personality disturbance. Other mental disorders can induce
personality changes. For instance, in the early phases of schizophrenia, individuals
can develop symptoms that resemble those often attributed to a personality disorder,
such as social withdrawal, magical thinking, impulsive acts, or mild suspiciousness,
all occurring in the absence of frank hallucinations or delusions. The person with ma-
jor depressive disorder can become socially withdrawn, develop low self-esteem, lack
self-confidence, and become dependent on others even for simple decisions. These
traits should be attributed to the major depression unless they clearly predate the on-
set of the depression and are part of an enduring pattern of experience and behavior.
In contrast, other medical disorders also must be ruled out as a cause of the per-
sonality pattern. Persons who use alcohol or other drugs excessively can develop
symptoms suggesting a personality disorder—for example, drug-seeking behaviors
that lead them to become irresponsible, to lie, or to commit crimes, or to become ap-
athetic, erratic, or impulsive. Brain lesions, such as those caused by tumors or strokes,
can contribute to the development of emotional lability, impulsive behavior, suspi-
ciousness, or apathy.

CLUSTER A PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Paranoid Personality Disorder

_Paranoid personality disorder_ describes individuals who are chronically suspicious and
distrust others. In response to paranoid beliefs, they can be irritable, hostile, and
avoidant. They can develop hypervigilance toward their environment, finding con-
spiracies against them wherever they look.
Paranoid personality disorder was introduced in DSM-I and has continued to be
included in all subsequent DSM editions. Adolf Meyer is often credited with intro-
ducing the concept of paranoid personality, but other psychiatrists writing at the turn
of the twentieth century, including Kraepelin, Bleuler, and Freud, provided early de-
scriptions. Research suggests that paranoid personality disorder lies within the
schizophrenia spectrum and results from a common genetic predisposition.

Diagnostic Criteria for Paranoid Personality Disorder **301.0 (F60.0)**

A. A pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their motives are in-
terpreted as malevolent, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of
contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:

1. Suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming, or de-
    ceiving him or her.
2. Is preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of
    friends or associates.
3. Is reluctant to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information
    will be used maliciously against him or her.
4. Reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or
    events.
5. Persistently bears grudges (i.e., is unforgiving of insults, injuries, or slights).
6. Perceives attacks on his or her character or reputation that are not apparent to
    others and is quick to react angrily or to counterattack.
7. Has recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding fidelity of spouse or
    sexual partner.

B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder
or depressive disorder with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder and
is not attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.

**Note:** If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” i.e., “par-
anoid personality disorder (premorbid).”

Schizoid Personality Disorder

Schizoid personality disorder describes people who have difficulty achieving inti-
macy or developing emotionally meaningful relationships. People with schizoid per-


**_Personality Disorders_** **395**

sonality disorder choose solitary activities and tend to have no close relationships,
including with family members. These individuals rarely experience strong emo-
tions, express little desire for sexual intimacy with another person, tend to be indif-
ferent to praise or criticism, and display a constricted affect. Individuals with schizoid
personality disorder may come across to others as dull, emotionally constricted, and
aloof.
Schizoid personality disorder was introduced in DSM-I and has continued to be
included in all subsequent DSM editions. DSM-I and DSM-II emphasized the pres-
ence of autistic magical thinking, which is now considered a symptom of schizotypal
personality disorder. The disorder is not diagnosed in persons with schizophrenia or
other psychotic disorders because these conditions are typically accompanied by a se-
clusive lifestyle.
The disorder is uncommon in psychiatric settings because persons with this per-
sonality disorder rarely seek care. The distinction between schizoid and avoidant per-
sonality disorder can sometimes be difficult to make, but it rests on the motivation
underlying the person’s tendency to avoid interpersonal relationships.

Diagnostic Criteria for Schizoid Personality Disorder **301.20 (F60.1)**

A. A pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range
of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings, beginning by early adulthood
and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:

1. Neither desires nor enjoys close relationships, including being part of a family.
2. Almost always chooses solitary activities.
3. Has little, if any, interest in having sexual experiences with another person.
4. Takes pleasure in few, if any, activities.
5. Lacks close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives.
6. Appears indifferent to the praise or criticism of others.
7. Shows emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affectivity.

B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder
or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or au-
tism spectrum disorder and is not attributable to the physiological effects of an-
other medical condition.
**Note:** If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” i.e.,
“schizoid personality disorder (premorbid).”

Schizotypal Personality Disorder

Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of peculiar behavior,
odd speech and thinking, and unusual perceptual experiences. People with these symp-
toms may appear odd and unusual, but they are not psychotic. The disorder was new
to DSM-III, its inclusion prompted by evidence that relatives of individuals with


**396** DSM-5 Guidebook

schizophrenia often displayed a cluster of schizophrenic-like traits, observations
noted earlier by Kraepelin and Bleuler. Genetic and neurophysiological evidence later
confirmed membership of this disorder within the schizophrenia spectrum.
Because a certain proportion of people diagnosed with schizotypal personality
disorder develop schizophrenia, it may be more appropriate to understand their
schizotypal traits as early (or prodromal) manifestations of schizophrenia. This can be
coded by adding “(premorbid)” after the diagnosis in a person who has developed
schizophrenia. Attenuated psychosis syndrome, described in Chapter 22, “Conditions
for Further Study,” and autism spectrum disorder, described in Chapter 3, “Neurode-
velopmental Disorders,” may be other diagnostic considerations.
The placement of schizotypal personality disorder alongside the psychotic disor-
ders was debated during the development of DSM-IV. The decision at that time was
to follow convention and keep schizotypal personality disorder in the personality
disorders chapter, recognizing that other personality disorders also have spectrum re-
lationships (e.g., avoidant personality disorder and anxiety disorders, borderline per-
sonality disorder and mood disorders). These arguments were revisited during DSM-
5 deliberations, and the Psychotic Disorders Work Group recommended that the dis-
order be moved to the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disor-
ders” as part of a general reorganization. As mentioned earlier, the text and criteria
remain in this chapter and are unchanged from DSM-IV.
Schizotypal personality disorder is common and has a relatively stable course,
with onset in childhood. It is often found in offspring of people with schizophrenia.
Some individuals who meet this description in adolescence will go on to develop
schizophrenia. After the age of risk for schizophrenia, typical individuals with schizo-
typal personality disorder rarely develop schizophrenia, and the symptoms may di-
minish with advancing age.

Diagnostic Criteria for Schizotypal
Personality Disorder **301.22 (F21)**

A. A pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort
with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by cognitive or per-
ceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior, beginning by early adulthood
and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:

1. Ideas of reference (excluding delusions of reference).
2. Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is inconsistent with
    subcultural norms (e.g., superstitiousness, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, or
    “sixth sense”; in children and adolescents, bizarre fantasies or preoccupations).
3. Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions.
4. Odd thinking and speech (e.g., vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelab-
    orate, or stereotyped).
5. Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation.
6. Inappropriate or constricted affect.


**_Personality Disorders_** **397**

7. Behavior or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or peculiar.
8. Lack of close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives.
9. Excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with familiarity and tends to be
    associated with paranoid fears rather than negative judgments about self.

B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder
or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism
spectrum disorder.

**Note:** If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” e.g.,
“schizotypal personality disorder (premorbid).”

CLUSTER B PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Antisocial Personality Disorder

Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of poor social
conformity, deceitfulness, impulsivity, criminality, and lack of remorse. The disorder
is common, with a 12-month prevalence in the general population estimated at 3.3%.
The disorder is more common in men than in women and is frequent in psychiatric
and correctional settings.
Although descriptions of antisocial personality disorder date to the early nineteenth
century, formal descriptions date to DSM-I, which included the category “sociopathic
personality disturbance” to describe a variety of “reactions” (including antisocial re-
action) that placed individuals in conflict with society. Antisocial personality disorder
came into its own in DSM-II as a specific type of personality disorder, although it was
only with DSM-III that diagnostic criteria were developed. The criteria were strongly
influenced by the work of Lee Robins and her colleagues at Washington University
(Black 2013). The disorder was described as consisting of an explicit set of irresponsi-
ble behaviors and antisocial acts, such as an inability to maintain consistent employ-
ment, illegal and aggressive behavior, and sexual promiscuity. The focus on behavioral
traits has been a bone of contention ever since among clinicians and researchers who
believe the criteria ignore the disorder’s underlying psychological traits. Partly in re-
sponse to these concerns, “lack of remorse” was added as a symptom in DSM-III-R. The
criteria were simplified for DSM-IV, in part on the basis of results from data reanaly-
ses and field trials, and are unchanged in DSM-5.
Individuals with this disorder may have little sense of responsibility, lack judgment,
blame others, and rationalize their behaviors. Many people with antisocial personality
disorder engage in criminal acts and are caught up in the criminal justice system. Do-
mestic violence is common and divorce frequent. In the most severe cases, the indi-
vidual may show a disturbing degree of callousness and amorality.


**398** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder **301.7 (F60.2)**

A. A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, occurring
since age 15 years, as indicated by three (or more) of the following:

1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors, as indicated
    by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest.
2. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others
    for personal profit or pleasure.
3. Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead.
4. Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or as-
    saults.
5. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others.
6. Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consis-
    tent work behavior or honor financial obligations.
7. Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having
    hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.

B. The individual is at least age 18 years.
C. There is evidence of conduct disorder with onset before age 15 years.
D. The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Borderline Personality Disorder

Although the term has a much longer history, borderline personality disorder was
first included in DSM-III as a syndrome of profound identity disturbance, unstable
moods, and difficult interpersonal relationships. Precursors were _emotionally unstable
personality_ in DSM-I and _explosive personality_ in DSM-II. The criteria were slightly
modified for DSM-III-R and DSM-IV and are unchanged in DSM-5. Core symptoms
include a pervasive pattern of anger dyscontrol, affective instability, impulsive be-
havior, and unstable and overly intense interpersonal relationships.
Borderline personality disorder is one of the more common personality disorders,
having a prevalence of 1.6%–5.9% in the general population; it is more frequent in
women. Individuals with borderline personality disorder often hurt themselves—for
example, by cutting or burning—and frequently attempt suicide. An estimated 8%–
10% of persons with borderline personality disorder eventually commit suicide.

Diagnostic Criteria for Borderline Personality
Disorder **301.83 (F60.3)**

A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and af-
fects, and marked impulsivity, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety
of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:


**_Personality Disorders_** **399**

1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. ( **Note:** Do not include sui-
    cidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)
2. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by al-
    ternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.
3. Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.
4. Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending,
    sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating). ( **Note:** Do not include sui-
    cidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)
5. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior.
6. Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dyspho-
    ria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few
    days).
7. Chronic feelings of emptiness.
8. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays
    of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).
9. Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.

Histrionic Personality Disorder

Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of excessive emotionality
and attention-seeking behavior and includes such symptoms as excessive concern
with appearance and wanting to be the center of attention. Histrionic persons can be
gregarious and charming but can also be manipulative, vain, and demanding.
The disorder takes its name from _hysteria_ , a condition first described in the nine-
teenth century and associated with conversion, somatization, and dissociation symp-
toms. Self-dramatizing and attention-seeking behaviors were considered to be associ-
ated with hysteria. _Hysterical personality_ was included in DSM-II and was renamed
_histrionic personality disorder_ in DSM-III so as not to be confused with hysteria (renamed
_somatization disorder_ ). The disorder has a prevalence of nearly 2% in the general popu-
lation and is more frequently diagnosed in women.

Diagnostic Criteria for Histrionic Personality
Disorder **301.50 (F60.4)**

A pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking, beginning by
early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of
the following:

1. Is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of attention.
2. Interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive
    or provocative behavior.
3. Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions.
4. Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self.
5. Has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail.


**400** DSM-5 Guidebook

6. Shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion.
7. Is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances).
8. Considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are.

Narcissistic Personality Disorder

Narcissistic personality disorder is named for Narcissus, from Greek mythology, who
fell in love with his own reflection. Freud used the term to describe persons who were
self-absorbed, and psychoanalysts have focused on the narcissist’s need to bolster his
or her self-esteem through grandiose fantasy, exaggerated ambition, exhibitionism,
and feelings of entitlement. The disorder was first included in DSM-III, and the crite-
ria were modified for DSM-III-R and DSM-IV. The criteria for narcissistic personality
disorder are unchanged in DSM-5. The prevalence of this disorder may be as high as
6.2% in the general population, and most persons receiving the diagnosis are male.

Diagnostic Criteria for Narcissistic Personality
Disorder **301.81 (F60.81)**

A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and
lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as
indicated by five (or more) of the following:

1. Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and tal-
    ents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements).
2. Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or
    ideal love.
3. Believes that he or she is “special” and unique and can only be understood by, or
    should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions).
4. Requires excessive admiration.
5. Has a sense of entitlement (i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable
    treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations).
6. Is interpersonally exploitative (i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her
    own ends).
7. Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of oth-
    ers.
8. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her.
9. Shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes.

CLUSTER C PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Avoidant Personality Disorder

Avoidant personality disorder was introduced in DSM-III and was created to distin-
guish individuals who avoid social interaction because of fears of rejection, from in-


**_Personality Disorders_** **401**

dividuals with either a schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder who have an im-
paired capacity for social relatedness. Predecessors include schizoid personality in
DSM-I and DSM-II and inadequate personality in DSM-II. The latter term was used
to describe individuals who had experienced failure in several important life domains,
such as interpersonal relationships and occupations. The criteria for avoidant person-
ality disorder are unchanged in DSM-5.
Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by low self-esteem, reluctance to
engage in new activities, avoidance of social activities and interpersonal interactions,
anxious preoccupation with social evaluation, and a general lack of positive engage-
ment. Many of these traits are present from early childhood, and they typically persist
into adulthood but become less evident with age. There is considerable overlap with
several of the anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia. The
disorder is equally prevalent in men and women, with an overall prevalence in the
general population of 2.4%.

Diagnostic Criteria for Avoidant Personality Disorder **301.82 (F60.6)**

A pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to
negative evaluation, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts,
as indicated by four (or more) of the following:

1. Avoids occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact be-
    cause of fears of criticism, disapproval, or rejection.
2. Is unwilling to get involved with people unless certain of being liked.
3. Shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of being shamed
    or ridiculed.
4. Is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations.
5. Is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy.
6. Views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others.
7. Is unusually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new activities be-
    cause they may prove embarrassing.

Dependent Personality Disorder

Dependent personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of relying excessively
on others for emotional support and making everyday decisions. The disorder was listed
as a subtype of the DSM-I passive-aggressive personality, was omitted from DSM-II,
and was subsequently reintroduced in DSM-III. Psychoanalytically oriented clini-
cians have linked dependency to fixation at the oral stage of development, which fo-
cuses on the biological gratification that arises from feeding. Other experts have tied
dependent personality to the disruption of attachments early in life, or to overprotec-
tion and parental authoritarianism experienced in childhood. Dependent personality
disorder has a prevalence of around 0.5% in the general population and is diagnosed
more frequently in women.


**402** DSM-5 Guidebook

There have been few empirical studies of dependent personality disorder. Some
experts believe the disorder is not sufficiently distinctive to stand alone and point to
the fact that dependency on others commonly occurs in people with other personality
disorder types and in persons with chronic medical or mental disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Dependent Personality
Disorder **301.6 (F60.7)**

A pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and
clinging behavior and fears of separation, beginning by early adulthood and present
in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:

1. Has difficulty making everyday decisions without an excessive amount of advice
    and reassurance from others.
2. Needs others to assume responsibility for most major areas of his or her life.
3. Has difficulty expressing disagreement with others because of fear of loss of sup-
    port or approval. ( **Note:** Do not include realistic fears of retribution.)
4. Has difficulty initiating projects or doing things on his or her own (because of a lack
    of self-confidence in judgment or abilities rather than a lack of motivation or en-
    ergy).
5. Goes to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others, to the
    point of volunteering to do things that are unpleasant.
6. Feels uncomfortable or helpless when alone because of exaggerated fears of be-
    ing unable to care for himself or herself.
7. Urgently seeks another relationship as a source of care and support when a close
    relationship ends.
8. Is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to take care of himself or her-
    self.

Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is one of the older personality disorders,
having originated with Freud’s formulation of the anal character whose symptoms
are orderliness, parsimony, and obstinacy. Compulsive personality was included in
DSM-I, and the name was changed to obsessive compulsive personality in DSM-II.
The description emphasized conformity and adherence to standards, rigidity, over-
conscientiousness, and inability to relax, which were thought to predispose to “obses-
sive compulsive neurosis” (i.e., obsessive-compulsive disorder). In DSM-II, the disorder
was parenthetically called “anankastic personality.” The criteria had minor modifica-
tions in DSM-III-R and DSM-IV; they are unchanged in DSM-5. Obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder is conceptualized as a chronic maladaptive pattern of excessive
perfectionism, preoccupation with orderliness and detail, and need for control of
one’s emotions and environment that contributes to significant distress or impair-
ment, particularly in the areas of interpersonal functioning. The disorder is relatively


**_Personality Disorders_** **403**

common, having a prevalence in the general population that may be as high as 7.9%.
It occurs more commonly in men than in women.

Diagnostic Criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive
Personality Disorder **301.4 (F60.5)**

A pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and
interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning
by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more)
of the following:

1. Is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the ex-
    tent that the major point of the activity is lost.
2. Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is unable to com-
    plete a project because his or her own overly strict standards are not met).
3. Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities
    and friendships (not accounted for by obvious economic necessity).
4. Is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics,
    or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification).
5. Is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no senti-
    mental value.
6. Is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly
    his or her way of doing things.
7. Adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as
    something to be hoarded for future catastrophes.
8. Shows rigidity and stubbornness.

OTHER PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Personality Change Due to

Another Medical Condition

This category was moved from DSM-IV’s “Mental Disorders Due to a General Medi-
cal Condition.” The predominant problem is a persistent personality disturbance, or
change, that is attributed to another medical condition such as a frontal lobe lesion.
With this condition, the disturbance represents a change from the individual’s usual
personality pattern. (In children, the period of change lasts at least 1 year.) Medical
evaluation has established that the personality change has been brought about by a
medical condition, and the change does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium. Finally, the change causes distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning.
Commonly observed manifestations consistent with the personality change in-
clude mood instability, poor impulse control, aggressive outbursts, apathy, suspicious-


**404** DSM-5 Guidebook

ness, and paranoid ideations. Others may see the person as being not himself or herself.
The nature of the symptoms may differ markedly from person to person depending
on the location of the brain lesion or the pathophysiological process underlying the
disturbance. Clinicians may specify the predominant pattern or symptoms (e.g., la-
bile type).

Diagnostic Criteria for Personality Change
Due to Another Medical Condition **310.1 (F07.0)**

A. A persistent personality disturbance that represents a change from the individual’s
previous characteristic personality pattern.
**Note:** In children, the disturbance involves a marked deviation from normal devel-
opment or a significant change in the child’s usual behavior patterns, lasting at
least 1 year.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical
condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (including an-
other mental disorder due to another medical condition).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify whether:
**Labile type:** If the predominant feature is affective lability.
**Disinhibited type:** If the predominant feature is poor impulse control as evidenced
by sexual indiscretions, etc.
**Aggressive type:** If the predominant feature is aggressive behavior.
**Apathetic type:** If the predominant feature is marked apathy and indifference.
**Paranoid type:** If the predominant feature is suspiciousness or paranoid ideation.
**Other type:** If the presentation is not characterized by any of the above subtypes.
**Combined type:** If more than one feature predominates in the clinical picture.
**Unspecified type**

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition (e.g., 310.1 [F07.0] per-
sonality change due to temporal lobe epilepsy). The other medical condition should
be coded and listed separately immediately before the personality disorder due to an-
other medical condition (e.g., 345.40 [G40.209] temporal lobe epilepsy; 310.1 [F07.0]
personality change due to temporal lobe epilepsy).

Other Specified Personality Disorder and

Unspecified Personality Disorder

These categories are used when an individual has symptoms of a personality disorder
that cause distress and impairment but do not meet the full criteria for any of the more


**_Personality Disorders_** **405**

specific disorders in the class. In these situations, the clinician has judged that the
general personality disorder criteria have been met.
The category other specified personality disorder is used when the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the cri-
teria. Clinicians are encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., mixed personality
features).

Other Specified Personality Disorder **301.89 (F60.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a personal-
ity disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation-
al, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria
for any of the disorders in the personality disorders diagnostic class. The other specified
personality disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any
specific personality disorder. This is done by recording “other specified personality dis-
order” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “mixed personality features”).

The category unspecified personality disorder is used when the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason why the criteria are not met for a specific personality disor-
der and when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Unspecified Personality Disorder **301.9 (F60.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a person-
ality disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the personality disorders diagnostic class. The unspec-
ified personality disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific personality disorder,
and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

- The DSM-IV criteria for a general personality disorder and the ten specific dis-
    order types are unchanged in DSM-5. An alternative diagnostic scheme devel-
    oped by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group that
    combines categorical diagnosis with dimensional ratings of personality do-
    mains and traits is included in Section III (“Alternative DSM-5 Model for Person-
    ality Disorders”).


**406** DSM-5 Guidebook

- The multiaxial diagnostic system introduced in DSM-III has been discontinued.
    Personality disorders are now coded at the same level as other mental dis-
    orders. The three personality disorder clusters (i.e., Clusters A, B, C) are un-
    changed.
- Personality change due to another medical condition has been moved to this
    class from DSM-IV’s “Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition.” In
    DSM-5, disorders judged due to another medical disorder are placed in the
    class with which they share the predominant symptom pattern.
- The diagnosis personality disorder not otherwise specified has been replaced
    by other specified personality disorder and unspecified personality disorder.
    These residual diagnoses can be used when an individual who otherwise meets
    the general personality disorder criteria does not meet criteria for one of the 10
    specific disorders and, in the case of unspecified personality disorder, when there
    is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.
