## This new chapter on disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct

disorders brings together disorders that appeared in the DSM-IV chapters “Disorders
Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” (oppositional defi-
ant disorder, conduct disorder), “Personality Disorders” (antisocial personality disor-
der—see Chapter 18 for diagnostic criteria and a detailed description), and “Impulse-
Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified” (intermittent explosive disorder, pyro-
mania, kleptomania). The chapter represents a departure from DSM-IV, but reflects
the approach taken by the DSM-5 Task Force to group related disorders based on clin-
ical and biological evidence. The disorders are listed in Table 15–1.
These disorders are unified by the presence of impaired self-regulation that results
in difficult, disruptive, aggressive, or antisocial behavior. These behaviors are usually
multidetermined and associated with physical or verbal injury to self, others, or ob-
jects, or with violating the rights of others. They appear in several forms and may be
defensive, premeditated, or impulsive. Whereas defensive aggression is normative,
premeditated and impulsive forms of aggression are viewed as pathological. Addition-
ally, some disruptive behavior may be normative during adolescent development, but
repeated disruptive behavior may represent a maladaptive behavioral trait that be-
gins early in life and continues into adulthood.

**TABLE 15–1. DSM-5 disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders**

Throughout the history of DSM, anger, rage, and aggression have characterized a
number of personality and problematic behavior disorders. In DSM-I, aggression was
specifically identified as occurring in persons with passive-aggressive personality, ag-
gressive type. In DSM-II, explosive personality (epileptoid personality disorder) was
added and was described as follows: “This behavior pattern is characterized by gross
outbursts of rage or of verbal or physical aggressiveness. These outbursts are strikingly
different from the patient’s usual behavior, and he may be regretful and repentant for
them” (American Psychiatric Association 1968, p. 42).
Several additional disorders occurring in adults have specifically featured aggres-
sion as a symptom. Intermittent explosive disorder was introduced in DSM-III to de-
scribe persons with episodes of aggression grossly out of proportion to precipitating
stressors, and was considered a rough equivalent to explosive personality. The disor-
der continued mostly unchanged through DSM-IV. Isolated explosive disorder, also
introduced in DSM-III, was used to describe persons with a single, discrete episode
of uncharacteristic aggression. This disorder was dropped from subsequent editions
because of its limited utility. Aggressive behavior was listed as a criterion for antiso-
cial personality disorder in DSM-III (Criterion C5) and DSM-IV (Criterion A4).
Among youth, several diagnoses have featured aggressive or oppositional behav-
ior. Most prominent is oppositional defiant disorder, which describes a persistent pat-
tern of negativistic, hostile, defiant, and disobedient behaviors toward others. Another
is conduct disorder, which is a persistent pattern of behavior that involves significant
violations of the rights of others and/or major societal norms.
The history of disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders dates to DSM-II
and the category “Behavior Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence,” which was lim-
ited to a small number of diagnoses described as arising from divergent environmental
factors: runaway reaction, unsocialized aggressive reaction, and group delinquent reac-
tion. (Interestingly, although the word _reaction_ was discarded for DSM-II adult diagno-
ses, the word was retained for use in child and adolescent diagnoses.) The runaway
reaction diagnosis described individuals who fled threatening situations at home and
engaged in covert acts of stealing as a means of self-preservation. The unsocialized ag-
gressive reaction diagnosis described loners with a pattern of hostile disobedience,
aggressiveness, stealing, and lying, whose behaviors arose primarily as a reaction to in-


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **297**

consistent discipline and parental rejection. The group delinquent reaction diagnosis
included individuals who committed predominately nonaggressive acts as part of a de-
linquent peer group, and their behavior problems were purportedly a consequence of
being poorly monitored in an impoverished neighborhood.
In DSM-III, this category was renamed “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in In-
fancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” and was expanded to include a large number of
diagnoses of varying degrees of severity and stability. Oppositional disorder and con-
duct disorder were among the new diagnoses. The former was renamed oppositional
defiant disorder in DSM-III-R. Conduct disorder was considered the childhood pre-
cursor to antisocial personality disorder, which was not to be diagnosed unless the in-
dividual was at least age 18 years. This condition was distinct from oppositional
disorder, which primarily involved disobedient opposition to authority figures, but
not overt aggression. The presence of conduct disorder excluded the diagnosis of op-
positional disorder because it was believed that oppositional behavior was a feature
of most individuals with conduct disorder.
In DSM-5, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder are now grouped
with antisocial personality disorder and intermittent explosive disorder, thereby re-
flecting emerging evidence supporting their clinical and biological commonality
along a developmental spectrum. Antisocial personality disorder involves violations
of the rights of others. Intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by impulsive
aggressive and assaultive behaviors that are out of proportion to stressors.

Oppositional Defiant Disorder

Irritability, anger, defiance, and temper are specific descriptors of oppositional defi-
ant disorder (Burke et al. 2002). In DSM-III, this disorder was introduced as opposi-
tional disorder and was characterized by a negative and disobedient opposition to
authority. The authors of DSM-5 consider oppositional defiant disorder to be a devel-
opmental antecedent for some youth with conduct disorder, thereby suggesting that
the disorders may reflect different stages of a spectrum of disruptive behavior. In fact,
DSM-5 organizes oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial per-
sonality disorder hierarchically and developmentally to reflect age-dependent ex-
pressions of the same underlying diathesis. Transient oppositional behavior is very
common in childhood and adolescence, but oppositional defiant disorder occurs in
1%–11% of youth. The disorder is more prevalent in boys before puberty and has an equal
gender prevalence for young people after puberty. Clinicians can specify whether the dis-
order is mild, moderate, or severe.

Diagnostic Criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder **313.81 (F91.3)**

A. A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness
lasting at least 6 months as evidenced by at least four symptoms from any of the fol-
lowing categories, and exhibited during interaction with at least one individual who is
not a sibling.


**298** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
Angry/Irritable Mood
```
1. Often loses temper.
2. Is often touchy or easily annoyed.
3. Is often angry and resentful.
**Argumentative/Defiant Behavior**
4. Often argues with authority figures or, for children and adolescents, with adults.
5. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures
    or with rules.
6. Often deliberately annoys others.
7. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.
**Vindictiveness**
8. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months.
**Note:** The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should be used to distin-
guish a behavior that is within normal limits from a behavior that is symptomatic.
For children younger than 5 years, the behavior should occur on most days for a
period of at least 6 months unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals
5 years or older, the behavior should occur at least once per week for at least 6
months, unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). While these frequency criteria pro-
vide guidance on a minimal level of frequency to define symptoms, other factors
should also be considered, such as whether the frequency and intensity of the be-
haviors are outside a range that is normative for the individual’s developmental
level, gender, and culture.

B. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the individual or others in his
or her immediate social context (e.g., family, peer group, work colleagues), or it im-
pacts negatively on social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of func-
tioning.
C. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic, sub-
stance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the criteria are not met for dis-
ruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Symptoms are confined to only one setting (e.g., at home, at school, at work,
with peers).
**Moderate:** Some symptoms are present in at least two settings.
**Severe:** Some symptoms are present in three or more settings.

Criterion A

Even well-adjusted children can display behaviors consistent with one or more of the
symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder. Symptoms of oppositional defiant disor-
der, however, must be part of a pattern of behavior that is frequent and not typical for
the child’s developmental level. Over a 6-month period, the child must demonstrate
at least four of eight behavioral symptoms, which have been grouped into three log-
ical categories: angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, and vindic-
tiveness. Although in DSM-IV the criterion stated that the behaviors are exhibited


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **299**

“often,” little guidance was provided about how to objectively define _often._ DSM-5 pro-
vides clarification as to the necessary frequency of behavior and distinguishes it by
age: “For children younger than 5 years, the behavior should occur on most days for
a period of at least 6 months unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8).” For individuals
5 years or older, the behavior should occur at least once per week for at least 6 months,
unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8).”
The essential behaviors have not changed from those in DSM-IV except that vindic-
tive behavior has been refined to require at least two episodes during the past 6 months.
Another change requires that these behaviors not have been exhibited only in relation
to a sibling.
In DSM-5, the behaviors are grouped depending on whether they are emotional
or behavioral in nature. Research suggests that the symptoms of oppositional defiant
disorder are highly intercorrelated and that all contribute to the prediction of disrup-
tive behavior disorder outcomes. However, the emotional symptoms independently
predict mood and anxiety disorders.

Criterion B

The disorder is associated with distress in the individual or in others in his or her im-
mediate social context, or impacts negatively on social, educational, vocational, or
other important areas of functioning. This criterion helps distinguish occasional dis-
ruptive behavior in an otherwise well-adjusted child or adolescent from disruptive
behavior of someone with a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. In a study of
youth with DSM-IV oppositional defiant disorder (Burke et al 2002), nearly all sub-
jects reported trouble at home (96%) and in school (85%), and fewer had trouble with
peers (67%).

Criterion C

DSM-5 does not include the exclusionary criterion of DSM-IV that allowed for the di-
agnosis of oppositional defiant disorder only if the criteria for conduct disorder were
not met. _The two diagnoses may now be comorbid._ This change was based on research
which suggested that presence or absence of comorbid oppositional defiant disorder
helped predict outcome in conduct disorder.

Intermittent Explosive Disorder

Intermittent explosive disorder was introduced in DSM-III, but precursors included
the DSM-I passive-aggressive personality, aggressive type, characterized as “persis-
tent reaction to frustration with irritability, temper tantrums, and destructive behav-
ior,” and the DSM-II explosive personality. Individuals with the latter were
aggressive individuals with intermittently violent behavior. In DSM-III, this behavior
pattern was codified as intermittent explosive disorder and assigned to Axis I of the
new multiaxial system, rather than as a personality disorder on Axis II.
Aggressive outbursts in this disorder are characterized by rapid onset and short
duration; there is usually little or no prodrome. Episodes involve verbal assault, de-


**300** DSM-5 Guidebook

structive and nondestructive property assault, or injurious or noninjurious physical
assault. Aggressive outbursts most commonly occur in response to a minor provoca-
tion by a close intimate or associate, and subjects with intermittent explosive disorder
often have less severe episodes of verbal and nondestructive property assault be-
tween the more severe destructive-assaultive episodes. Episodes lead to substantial
subjective distress, impairment in social functioning, occupational difficulty, or legal
or financial problems. Research evidence suggests that “recurrent, problematic, impul-
sive aggression” has a prevalence of 5%–7% in the general adult population and per-
haps a higher percentage in psychiatric hospitals and clinics (Coccaro 2012).

Diagnostic Criteria for Intermittent
Explosive Disorder **312.34 (F63.81)**

A. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impuls-
es as manifested by either of the following:

1. Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights)
    or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring
    twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months. The physical aggression
    does not result in damage or destruction of property and does not result in
    physical injury to animals or other individuals.
2. Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and/or
physical assault involving physical injury against animals or other individuals
occurring within a 12-month period.
B. The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is
grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial
stressors.
C. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive
and/or anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective
(e.g., money, power, intimidation).
D. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in the individual
or impairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or are associated with
financial or legal consequences.
E. Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmental level).
F. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation dis-
order, a psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality
disorder) and are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alz-
heimer’s disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,
a medication). For children ages 6–18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part
of an adjustment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis.

**Note:** This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spec-
trum disorder when recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those
usually seen in these disorders and warrant independent clinical attention.


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **301**

Criterion A

The DSM-5 criteria operationalize the scope, frequency, and time frame for aggressive
behavior required, allowing intermittent explosive disorder to be diagnosed in the
presence of aggressive outbursts of high frequency and low intensity (Criterion A1)
or of low frequency and high intensity (Criterion A2). The A1 threshold was set at an
average of two outbursts per week for at least 3 months because this level of low-
intensity aggression responds well to treatment. The threshold for Criterion A2 was
set at three severe outbursts per year because this level of high-intensity aggression
distinguishes individuals who are significantly more aggressive from those with a
lower frequency of severe aggressive outbursts.

Criterion B

The essence of the disorder is that the outburst is grossly out of proportion to what might
occur in most persons faced with a stressful situation. Clearly, aggressive behavior oc-
curs for many reasons in people with and without mental illnesses. This criterion
helps to define what is (or is not) attributable to a mental illness, by establishing that the
behavioral response is out of bounds.

Criterion C

This new criterion requires that the aggressive behavior be impulsive in nature, an
important distinction because empirical data clearly separate impulsive from pre-
meditated aggression. This distinction helps to separate aggressive behavior that is
planned from that which occurs spontaneously and without reflection. The criterion
also helps to separate the outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder from aggres-
sive outbursts calculated to achieve an objective, such as frightening or intimidating
others, as might occur in a person with antisocial personality disorder.

Criterion D

In keeping with other disorders, intermittent explosive disorder in DSM-5 includes
the requirement that marked subjective distress or social or occupational dysfunction
be linked to the aggressive behavior. The disorder may cause considerable subjective
distress as the individual copes with the consequences of his or her behavior. For
most, the behavior is ego-dystonic and leads to feelings of embarrassment and re-
morse (unlike in antisocial personality disorder, in which the individual may not
experience either emotion). Because the outburst is disproportionate, it may disrupt
relationships, lead to occupational problems (e.g., being fired), or contribute to legal
problems if victims suffer personal injuries or must deal with property damage. Al-
though not stated, the intent of the diagnosis is not to provide legal cover for those
whose aggressive acts have selfish, financial, or political motives.

Criterion E

Intermittent explosive disorder appears as early as prepubertal childhood and peaks
in mid-adolescence, with a mean onset age ranging from about 13 to 21 years. Data also


**302** DSM-5 Guidebook

suggest that the disorder is persistent and follows a chronic course of at least 12 years.
By establishing a minimum age (or equivalent developmental level) of 6 years, DSM-5
authors are encouraging clinicians to use other diagnoses for children with recurrent
temper outbursts (i.e., disruptive mood dysregulation disorder), because the course
of such outbursts in a young child is of unclear significance.

Criterion F

Exclusions have changed. DSM-5 allows individuals with autism spectrum disorder,
other disruptive behavior disorders (conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disor-
der), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to be diagnosed with inter-
mittent explosive disorder. Although individuals with these disorders are sometimes
aggressive, the pattern of aggressive acts in these conditions tends to differ from that
seen in intermittent explosive disorder. For that reason, the DSM-5 ADHD and Disrup-
tive Behavior Disorders Work Group recommended that these exclusions be dropped.
Importantly, other exclusions remain, including antisocial and borderline personality
disorders. Also, aggressive behavior occurring in children ages 6–18 years who have
an adjustment disorder is not counted toward a diagnosis of intermittent explosive
disorder.

Conduct Disorder

The essential feature of conduct disorder is a repetitive and persistent pattern of be-
havior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate social norms or
rules are violated (Burke et al. 2002). The behaviors may entail aggressive conduct
that causes or threatens harm to others or animals, nonaggressive behavior resulting
in property damage, deceitfulness or theft, or serious violations of rules. General pop-
ulation surveys report prevalence rates ranging from 2% to more than 10%, and the
rates are higher in boys than in girls.
Conduct disorder was introduced in DSM-III. Four primary subtypes were pro-
posed on the basis of whether the individual exhibited aggressive (e.g., assault, rape)
or nonaggressive (e.g., lying, stealing) conduct problems and whether the individual
was socialized (e.g., has lasting friendships, feels guilt/remorse) or unsocialized (e.g.,
has no close friendships, lacks guilt/remorse). These subtypes were based largely on
subtypes of delinquency originally described in DSM-II, and symptoms and diag-
nostic thresholds were specified for each subgroup. The criteria were simplified in
DSM-III-R to include a single set of symptoms (e.g., being physically cruel to people,
destroying property, stealing, being truant) rather than having four subtypes. Each
symptom had to be present for at least 6 months to reach diagnostic threshold. DSM-
IV field trials supported adding bullying, threatening, or intimidating others to the
diagnostic criteria, as well as often staying out after dark without permission begin-
ning before age 13 years.
The criteria are essentially unchanged from DSM-IV. In addition to maintaining
the age-at-onset subtypes (childhood-onset type, adolescence-onset type), the work
group added the specifier “with limited prosocial emotions” to describe the childhood


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **303**

equivalent of the adult with psychopathy. _Psychopathy_ is a distinct syndrome that falls
within the antisocial spectrum and is characterized by lack of empathy and concern
for the feelings, wishes, and well-being of others. These traits are found in a minority
of youth with conduct disorder. Research suggests that individuals with conduct dis-
order who exhibit callous and unemotional traits have a worse outcome and poorer
response to treatment than do those without these traits.

Diagnostic Criteria for Conduct Disorder

A. A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or
major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated, as manifested by the
presence of at least three of the following 15 criteria in the past 12 months from any
of the categories below, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months:
**Aggression to People and Animals**

1. Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others.
2. Often initiates physical fights.
3. Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others (e.g., a bat,
    brick, broken bottle, knife, gun).
4. Has been physically cruel to people.
5. Has been physically cruel to animals.
6. Has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching, extor-
    tion, armed robbery).
7. Has forced someone into sexual activity.
**Destruction of Property**
8. Has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious
    damage.
9. Has deliberately destroyed others’ property (other than by fire setting).
**Deceitfulness or Theft**
10. Has broken into someone else’s house, building, or car.
11. Often lies to obtain goods or favors or to avoid obligations (i.e., “cons” others).
12. Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim (e.g., shoplift-
ing, but without breaking and entering; forgery).
**Serious Violations of Rules**
13. Often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions, beginning before age 13
years.
14. Has run away from home overnight at least twice while living in the parental or
parental surrogate home, or once without returning for a lengthy period.
15. Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13 years.

B. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social, ac-
ademic, or occupational functioning.
C. If the individual is age 18 years or older, criteria are not met for antisocial person-
ality disorder.


**304** DSM-5 Guidebook

Specify whether:
**312.81 (F91.1) Childhood-onset type:** Individuals show at least one symptom
characteristic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years.
**312.82 (F91.2) Adolescent-onset type:** Individuals show no symptom character-
istic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years.
**312.89 (F91.9) Unspecified onset:** Criteria for a diagnosis of conduct disorder are
met, but there is not enough information available to determine whether the onset
of the first symptom was before or after age 10 years.

Specify if:
**With limited prosocial emotions:** To qualify for this specifier, an individual must
have displayed at least two of the following characteristics persistently over at least 12
months and in multiple relationships and settings. These characteristics reflect the in-
dividual’s typical pattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning over this period
and not just occasional occurrences in some situations. Thus, to assess the criteria for
the specifier, multiple information sources are necessary. In addition to the individual’s
self-report, it is necessary to consider reports by others who have known the individual
for extended periods of time (e.g., parents, teachers, co-workers, extended family
members, peers).
**Lack of remorse or guilt:** Does not feel bad or guilty when he or she does
something wrong (exclude remorse when expressed only when caught and/or
facing punishment). The individual shows a general lack of concern about the
negative consequences of his or her actions. For example, the individual is not
remorseful after hurting someone or does not care about the consequences of
breaking rules.
**Callous—lack of empathy:** Disregards and is unconcerned about the feelings
of others. The individual is described as cold and uncaring. The person ap-
pears more concerned about the effects of his or her actions on himself or her-
self, rather than their effects on others, even when they result in substantial
harm to others.
**Unconcerned about performance:** Does not show concern about poor/prob-
lematic performance at school, at work, or in other important activities. The in-
dividual does not put forth the effort necessary to perform well, even when
expectations are clear, and typically blames others for his or her poor perfor-
mance.
**Shallow or deficient affect:** Does not express feelings or show emotions to oth-
ers, except in ways that seem shallow, insincere, or superficial (e.g., actions con-
tradict the emotion displayed; can turn emotions “on” or “off” quickly) or when
emotional expressions are used for gain (e.g., emotions displayed to manipulate
or intimidate others).

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Few if any conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diag-
nosis are present, and conduct problems cause relatively minor harm to others
(e.g., lying, truancy, staying out after dark without permission, other rule breaking).
**Moderate:** The number of conduct problems and the effect on others are interme-
diate between those specified in “mild” and those in “severe” (e.g., stealing without
confronting a victim, vandalism).


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **305**

```
Severe: Many conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis
are present, or conduct problems cause considerable harm to others (e.g., forced sex,
physical cruelty, use of a weapon, stealing while confronting a victim, breaking and en-
tering).
```
Criterion A

The list of 15 problem areas is unchanged from DSM-IV, as are the requirements that
three or more be present in the past 12 months and that the pattern of behavior be re-
petitive and persistent. Most children with conduct disorder have far more than three
symptoms. Although occasional problematic behaviors are normal (and even ex-
pected) to some extent in children, the severity and variety of these behaviors charac-
terize the person with conduct disorder.

Criterion B

Conduct disorder causes clinically significant impairment and distress to the child,
family, school, and community because of the inevitable conflicts that occur with par-
ents, teachers, and peers. Financial and legal repercussions, as well as physical injuries
from accidents or fights, are common. Poor frustration tolerance, irritability, temper
outbursts, and recklessness are frequently associated symptoms. Conduct disorder
behaviors may lead to school suspension or expulsion, problems in work adjustment,
sexually transmitted diseases, and unwanted pregnancy. These problems may pre-
clude attendance in ordinary schools or living in the parental home.

Criterion C

Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder lie along a continuum. Al-
though conduct disorder technically can be diagnosed at any age, the intention is that
it describes a childhood behavioral syndrome that is the precursor to antisocial per-
sonality disorder. Approximately 40% of young people with conduct disorder will
manifest antisocial personality disorder later in life.

Subtypes and Specifiers

Age-at-onset subtypes are unchanged from DSM-IV. The age at onset should be ob-
tained from both the youth and the caregiver. These subtypes have clinical and treat-
ment ramifications, because an individual with the childhood-onset subtype is more
likely to have co-occurring ADHD, to display physical aggression toward others, and
to develop antisocial personality disorder.
DSM-5 includes the new descriptive feature specifier “with limited prosocial emo-
tions.” These traits were suggested in the DSM-III “undersocialized type.” However,
this subtype was not continued in subsequent DSM editions because the term _under-
socialized_ was thought to be overly focused on social attachment. On the other hand,
research shows that the presence of limited prosocial emotions can delineate a subtype
with a particularly severe and recalcitrant form of antisocial behavior; distinct neuro-


**306** DSM-5 Guidebook

logical, cognitive, emotional, and social characteristics (e.g., deficits in processing
signs of fear and distress in others, less sensitivity to punishment, more fearless or
thrill-seeking behavior); and poorer treatment outcomes. In addition, limited proso-
cial emotions are relatively stable from childhood to early adolescence and early adult-
hood, and may be genetically influenced.

Antisocial Personality Disorder

Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of poor social
conformity, deceitfulness, impulsivity, criminality, and lack of remorse. Because the
disorder is closely connected with the spectrum of externalizing disorders discussed
in this class, it is dually coded here and in the chapter on personality disorders. For a
complete description of antisocial personality disorder and the DSM-5 criteria, see
Chapter 18, “Personality Disorders.”

Pyromania

Pyromania is characterized by an impulse to set fires. The disorder was first formally
recognized in DSM-III in the new category “Disorders of Impulse-Control Not Else-
where Classified.” Similar to the earlier idea of monomania, the definition focused on
the recurrent failure to resist impulses to set fire in persons who were not psychotic,
cognitively impaired, or antisocial. In DSM-III-R, these exclusions were removed and
an item was added to recognize that persons with pyromania tend to be fascinated
with or curious about fires. In DSM-IV, exclusions for mania and antisocial personality
disorder were restored. Other than minor editing, the DSM-5 criteria are unchanged.
The essential features of pyromania are the presence of multiple episodes of delib-
erate and purposeful fire setting and the failure to resist an impulse to set fires. Persons
with pyromania like watching fire. They may be recognized as regular “watchers” at
fires in their communities and enjoy setting off false fire alarms. Their fascination
leads some to seek employment or to volunteer as firefighters. They may be indiffer-
ent to the consequences of the fire and its effect on life and property, and they may get
satisfaction from the resulting destruction. The behavior may lead to property dam-
age, legal consequences, or injury or loss of life to the fire setter or to others.

Diagnostic Criteria for Pyromania **312.33 (F63.1)**

A. Deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion.
B. Tension or affective arousal before the act.
C. Fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational
contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses, consequences).
D. Pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting fires or when witnessing or participat-
ing in their aftermath.
E. The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an expression of sociopolitical
ideology, to conceal criminal activity, to express anger or vengeance, to improve


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **307**

one’s living circumstances, in response to a delusion or hallucination, or as a result
of impaired judgment (e.g., in major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability
[intellectual developmental disorder], substance intoxication).
F. The fire setting is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or anti-
social personality disorder.

Criterion A

This criterion requires that fire setting occur on more than one occasion. This sets the
bar at a minimum of two lifetime episodes. In truth, most persons with pyromania
will have committed far more episodes of fire setting, with some individuals setting
fires on a regular basis.

Criteria B, C, and D

These criteria get at the essence of the disorder. The sense of excitation is captured by
the individual’s sense of tension or affective arousal before the act, as well as pleasure,
gratification, or relief during or after the act. Most persons with pyromania have a fas-
cination with fire that may be reflected by their interest in watching fires. They spend
considerable time planning, setting, and watching fires.

Criteria E and F

These criteria exclude those individuals who set fires for political or other reasons
(such as arson for monetary gain) and those who set fires during a manic episode or
as part of a pattern of antisocial personality disorder.

Kleptomania

Although kleptomania has long been recognized, it was not officially designated a
psychiatric disorder until DSM-III, when it was placed in the category “Disorders of
Impulse-Control Not Elsewhere Classified.” In DSM-5, the criteria are essentially un-
changed.
The prevalence of kleptomania has been estimated at 0.3%–0.6% in the general
population. Among individuals hospitalized for mental health reasons, however,
research has demonstrated that nearly 8% endorse symptoms consistent with the cur-
rent diagnosis of kleptomania and 9% endorse a lifetime diagnosis (Grant et al. 2005).
The literature suggests that the majority of people with kleptomania are women, al-
though the gender disparity may be due to the fact that women are more likely to
present for treatment. The disorder typically has an onset by late adolescence (but
may begin in adulthood) and is often comorbid with mood, anxiety, and substance
use disorders.
People with kleptomania experience significant impairment in social and occupa-
tional functioning. Their intrusive thoughts and urges related to stealing can interfere
with their ability to concentrate at home and at work. Others report missing work, of-
ten in the afternoon, in order to steal. Inability to control their behavior leads to


**308** DSM-5 Guidebook

subjective feelings of shame and guilt. The disorder also leads to high levels of stress
that worsen as the stealing behavior intensifies. Additionally, many people with klep-
tomania face legal difficulties and experience public humiliation from arrests.

Diagnostic Criteria for Kleptomania **312.32 (F63.2)**

A. Recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not needed for personal
use or for their monetary value.
B. Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the theft.
C. Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the theft.
D. The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance and is not in re-
sponse to a delusion or a hallucination.
E. The stealing is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or anti-
social personality disorder.

Criterion A

This item focuses on the stealing that is performed in response to senseless urges for
unneeded items. This has often been considered the criterion that distinguishes indi-
viduals with kleptomania from ordinary shoplifters. Interpretation of this criterion is
controversial. The stereotype of the middle-aged female kleptomania patient who
steals particular items may not adequately account for all people with kleptomania.
Individuals with kleptomania may in fact desire the items they steal and be able to
use them, but they do not need them. This may be particularly the case with individ-
uals with kleptomania who also hoard items. These individuals may steal multiple
versions of the same item; although the item itself may be desired, it is not needed.

Criteria B and C

Many individuals will report a sense of tension immediately before committing the
theft, as well as pleasure or gratification afterward. These criteria have sometimes
been problematic because occasional individuals will deny feelings of tension or arousal
prior to the act and may deny feelings of pleasure or relief following the thefts, yet
they clearly have a problem with stealing of unneeded objects.

Criterion D

This item helps to separate people with a motivation to steal (“to express anger or
vengeance”) from the ordinary person with kleptomania who simply fails to resist an
impulse. Furthermore, the stealing is not motivated by psychotic thinking.

Criterion E

These exclusions are needed because during manic episodes, individuals may take ob-
jects in response to their abnormal thinking and behavior. A youth with a conduct dis-
order and an adult with antisocial personality disorder may steal because they want


**_Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders_** **309**

the items; this is stealing in the ordinary sense. Their stealing is done without concern
for the consequences of their behavior or the people they may hurt in the process.

Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control,

and Conduct Disorder and Unspecified

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and

Conduct Disorder

These two residual categories are available to clinicians for use in diagnosing presen-
tations characteristic of disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause
distress or impairment but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the
class. The category other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder
is also used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet full criteria (e.g., “recurrent behavioral
outbursts of insufficient frequency”).

Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and
Conduct Disorder **312.89(F91.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control, and
conduct disorders diagnostic class. The other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and
conduct disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any spe-
cific disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder. This is done by recording “other
specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder” followed by the specific rea-
son (e.g., “recurrent behavioral outbursts of insufficient frequency”).

The category unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder is used
in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria
for a specific disorder are not met, or there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis.

Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and
Conduct Disorder **312.9 (F91.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate
but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control,


**310** DSM-5 Guidebook

and conduct disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and
conduct disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific disruptive, impulse-control,
and conduct disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient informa-
tion to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- This new chapter brings together disorders unified by the presence of difficult,
    disruptive, aggressive, or antisocial behavior. The disorders include opposition-
    al defiant disorder, conduct disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, antisocial
    personality disorder, pyromania, and kleptomania.
- DSM-5 has removed the exclusionary criterion of DSM-IV that allowed for the
    diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder only if the criteria for conduct disorder
    were not met. The two diagnoses may now be comorbid.
- Intermittent explosive disorder requires outbursts to be either high frequency
    and low intensity (at least two outbursts per week for 3 months) or low frequency
    and high intensity (three or more severe outbursts a year).
- Conduct disorder now has a “with limited prosocial emotions” specifier that allows
    clinicians to denote youth with the childhood equivalent of psychopathic traits
    such as lack of remorse or guilt, or callousness. These youth typically have a
    worse prognosis and response to treatment.
- While antisocial personality disorder is listed with this class, the criteria and text
    remain in the chapter on personality disorders.
