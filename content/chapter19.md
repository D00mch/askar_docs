**408** DSM-5 Guidebook

This chapter includes conditions of clinical importance that may
be a focus of diagnosis and treatment but are not considered mental disorders. These in-
clude 1) medication-induced movement disorders and other adverse effects of medica-
tion, and 2) other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention (V/Z codes). All of
these conditions have the potential to cause great distress to patients or their family mem-
bers. While these conditions are common, their codes are underutilized by clinicians.
The use of these codes is important because they represent conditions that either
are important in their own right or can adversely affect the course of a mental disorder.
For example, when a patient with schizophrenia refuses medication or takes it spo-
radically because of lack of insight or denial, that condition (V15.81/Z91.19 nonad-
herence to medical treatment) complicates the individual’s treatment and should be
coded in addition to the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Recording the codes for condi-
tions not thought to be mental disorders may also be useful simply to enable clini-
cians to note the individual’s reason for contact with the mental health care system.

MEDICATION NDUCED OVEMENT ISORDERS

AND OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS OF MEDICATION

-I M D

DSM-IV introduced the subcategory medication-induced movement disorders be-
cause of the importance of such disorders to treatment and differential diagnosis.
DSM-5 has given them their own chapter and expanded the title. These diagnoses can
be used to describe problems that patients sometimes develop with medications. Anti-
psychotic medications are the most common offenders, and they are widely known to
induce movement disorders in some patients. Movement disorders range from trou-
blesome but reversible (akathisia), to disabling and irreversible (tardive dyskinesia),
to even fatal in some cases (neuroleptic malignant syndrome [NMS]). Their inclusion
in DSM-5 may help boost their recognition and treatment, and help with differential
diagnosis. For example, medication-induced acute akathisia needs to be distin-
guished from anxiety disorders, whereas NMS needs to be distinguished from cata-
tonia. Many of the symptoms reported in patients with an akathisia (e.g., anxiety,
jitteriness) are indistinguishable from symptoms of an anxiety disorder. Therefore,
the clinician must take a thorough history to determine the temporal relationship be-
tween medication and symptom onset and consider other possible causes.
The term _neuroleptic_ was introduced in the 1950s to highlight the antipsychotic and
extrapyramidal side effects of chlorpromazine, and was soon used to describe any an-
tipsychotic medication. With the introduction of the “atypical,” or second-generation,
antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine), which have a lower propen-
sity to cause extrapyramidal side effects, the term has become outdated, although it
remains appropriate when describing medication-induced abnormal movements.
Neuroleptic medications include both conventional (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperi-
dol, fluphenazine) and atypical antipsychotics; certain dopamine receptor–blocking
drugs used to treat nausea and gastroparesis (e.g., prochlorperazine, promethazine,
trimethobenzamide, thiethylperazine, metoclopramide); and amoxapine, which is
marketed as an antidepressant.

Neuroleptic-Induced Parkinsonism and

Other Medication-Induced Parkinsonism

Parkinsonian tremor, muscular rigidity, akinesia (i.e., loss of movement or difficulty
initiating movement), or bradykinesia (i.e., slowing movement) developing within a
few weeks of starting or raising the dosage of a medication (e.g., a neuroleptic) or af-
ter reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.


**410** DSM-5 Guidebook

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

Although neuroleptic malignant syndrome is easily recognized in its classic full-
blown form, it is often heterogeneous in onset, presentation, progression, and out-
come. The clinical features described below are those considered most important in
making the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome based on consensus recom-
mendations.
Patients have generally been exposed to a dopamine antagonist within 72 hours
prior to symptom development. Hyperthermia (100.4F or 38.0C on at least two
occasions, measured orally), associated with profuse diaphoresis, is a distinguishing
feature of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, setting it apart from other neurological
side effects of antipsychotic medications. Extreme elevations in temperature, reflect-
ing a breakdown in central thermoregulation, are more likely to support the diagnosis
of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Generalized rigidity, described as “lead pipe” in
its most severe form and usually unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agents, is a cardi-
nal feature of the disorder and may be associated with other neurological symptoms
(e.g., tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia, dystonia, trismus, myoclonus, dysarthria, dyspha-
gia, rhabdomyolysis). Creatine kinase elevation of at least four times the upper limit
of normal is commonly seen. Changes in mental status, characterized by delirium or
altered consciousness ranging from stupor to coma, are often an early sign. Affected
individuals may appear alert but dazed and unresponsive, consistent with catatonic
stupor. Autonomic activation and instability—manifested by tachycardia (rate25%
above baseline), diaphoresis, blood pressure elevation (systolic or diastolic 25%
above baseline) or fluctuation (20 mmHg diastolic change or 25 mmHg systolic
change within 24 hours), urinary incontinence, and pallor—may be seen at any time
but provide an early clue to the diagnosis. Tachypnea (rate 50% above baseline) is
common, and respiratory distress—resulting from metabolic acidosis, hypermetabo-
lism, chest wall restriction, aspiration pneumonia, or pulmonary emboli—can occur
and lead to sudden respiratory arrest.
A workup, including laboratory investigation, to exclude other infectious, toxic,
metabolic, and neuropsychiatric etiologies or complications is essential. Although sev-
eral laboratory abnormalities are associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, no
single abnormality is specific to the diagnosis. Individuals with neuroleptic malignant
syndrome may have leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, decreased serum iron
concentrations, and elevations in serum muscle enzymes and catecholamines. Findings
from cerebrospinal fluid analysis and neuroimaging studies are generally normal,
whereas electroencephalography shows generalized slowing. Autopsy findings in fatal
cases have been nonspecific and variable, depending on complications.

Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia

Abnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes (oculogyric crisis),
head, neck (torticollis or retrocollis), limbs, or trunk developing within a few days of
starting or raising the dosage of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing
the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.


**_Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Conditions_** **411**

Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia

Subjective complaints of restlessness, often accompanied by observed excessive move-
ments (e.g., fidgety movements of the legs, rocking from foot to foot, pacing, inability
to sit or stand still), developing within a few weeks of starting or raising the dosage
of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication
used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.

Tardive Dyskinesia

Involuntary athetoid or choreiform movements (lasting at least a few weeks) gener-
ally of the tongue, lower face and jaw, and extremities (but sometimes involving the
pharyngeal, diaphragmatic, or trunk muscles) developing in association with the use
of a neuroleptic medication for at least a few months.
Symptoms may develop after a shorter period of medication use in older persons.
In some patients, movements of this type may appear after discontinuation, or after
change or reduction in dosage, of neuroleptic medications, in which case the condi-
tion is called _neuroleptic withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia._ Because withdrawal-emergent
dyskinesia is usually time-limited, lasting less than 4–8 weeks, dyskinesia that persists
beyond this window is considered to be tardive dyskinesia.

Tardive Dystonia and Tardive Akathisia

Tardive syndrome involving other types of movement problems, such as dystonia or
akathisia, which are distinguished by their late emergence in the course of treatment
and their potential persistence for months to years, even in the face of neuroleptic dis-
continuation or dosage reduction.

Medication-Induced Postural Tremor

Fine tremor (usually in the range of 8–12 Hz) occurring during attempts to maintain
a posture and developing in association with the use of medication (e.g., lithium, an-
tidepressants, valproate). This tremor is very similar to the tremor seen with anxiety,
caffeine, and other stimulants.

Other Medication-Induced Movement Disorder

This category is for medication-induced movement disorders not captured by any of
the specific disorders listed above. Examples include 1) presentations resembling
neuroleptic malignant syndrome that are associated with medications other than
neuroleptics and 2) other medication-induced tardive conditions.


**412** DSM-5 Guidebook

Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome

```
Initial Encounter
Subsequent Encounter
Sequelae
```
Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a set of symptoms that can occur after
an abrupt cessation (or marked reduction in dose) of an antidepressant medication
that was taken continuously for at least 1 month. Symptoms generally begin within
2–4 days and typically include specific sensory, somatic, and cognitive-emotional
manifestations. Frequently reported sensory and somatic symptoms include flashes
of light, “electric shock” sensations, nausea, and hyperresponsivity to noises or lights.
Nonspecific anxiety and feelings of dread may also be reported. Symptoms are alle-
viated by restarting the same medication or starting a different medication that has a
similar mechanism of action—for example, discontinuation symptoms after with-
drawal from a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor may be alleviated by
starting a tricyclic antidepressant. To qualify as antidepressant discontinuation syn-
drome, the symptoms should not have been present before the antidepressant dosage
was reduced and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., manic or
hypomanic episode, substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, somatic symptom
disorder).
Discontinuation symptoms may occur following treatment with tricyclic antide-
pressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine), serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g.,
phenelzine, selegiline, pargyline). The incidence of this syndrome depends on the
dosage and half-life of the medication being taken, as well as the rate at which the
medication is tapered. Short-acting medications that are stopped abruptly rather than
tapered gradually may pose the greatest risk. The short-acting selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is the agent most commonly associated with dis-
continuation symptoms, but such symptoms occur for all types of antidepressants.
Unlike withdrawal syndromes associated with opioids, alcohol, and other sub-
stances of abuse, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome has no pathognomonic
symptoms. Instead, the symptoms tend to be vague and variable and typically begin
2–4 days after the last dose of the antidepressant. For SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine), symp-
toms such as dizziness, ringing in the ears, “electric shocks in the head,” an inability
to sleep, and acute anxiety are described. The antidepressant use prior to discontinu-
ation must not have incurred hypomania or euphoria (i.e., there should be confidence
that the discontinuation syndrome is not the result of fluctuations in mood stability
associated with the previous treatment). The antidepressant discontinuation syn-
drome is based solely on pharmacological factors and is not related to the reinforcing
effects of an antidepressant. Also, in the case of stimulant augmentation of an antide-
pressant, abrupt cessation may result in stimulant withdrawal symptoms (see “Stim-
ulant Withdrawal” in Chapter 16, “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders”)
rather than the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome described here.

OTHER ONDITIONS HAT AY E

A FOCUS OF CLINICAL ATTENTION

C T M B

DSM authors have long recognized that certain problems may motivate people to
seek psychiatric care but that these conditions are not mental illnesses. In DSM-II,
problems experienced by people who were considered psychiatrically healthy that were
sufficiently severe to warrant a visit to a psychiatrist were assigned to the category
“conditions without manifest psychiatric disorder and non-specific conditions.” This
category included, for instance, marital maladjustment, occupational maladjustment,
and dyssocial behavior (e.g., for professional criminals who did not have antisocial
personality disorder). In DSM-III, the authors expanded the list and provided greater
specificity for the various problems not considered attributable to a mental disorder.
These were “V code” diagnoses, using wording taken from ICD-9-CM, which includes
the codes listed in a section called “Supplementary Classification of Factors Influencing
Health Status and Contact With Health Services.” (The letter _V_ has no special signif-
icance when used in this context.)
In DSM-IV, V code diagnoses were grouped as 1) relational problems; 2) problems
related to abuse or neglect (including the physical and sexual abuse of children and
adults and neglect of a child); and 3) additional conditions, including noncompliance
with treatment, malingering, adult antisocial behavior, child or adolescent antisocial
behavior, borderline intellectual functioning, age-related cognitive decline, bereave-
ment, academic problem, occupational problem, identity problem, religious or spiritual
problem, acculturation problem, and phase of life problem. Boundaries were created
to distinguish bereavement from major depressive disorder.
In addition to the subcategories relational problems and abuse and neglect, new sub-
categories in DSM-5 are educational and occupational problems; housing and economic
problems; other problems related to the social environment; problems related to crime
or interaction with the legal system; other health service encounters for counseling or
medical advice; problems related to other psychosocial, personal, and environmental
circumstances; and other circumstances of personal history. In DSM-5, the term _uncom-
plicated bereavement_ has been restored (V62.82/Z63.4), but those who develop a major
depressive episode in response to the death of a loved one should receive the diagnosis
of major depressive disorder (see Chapter 5, “Mood Disorders,” for further discussion).


**414** DSM-5 Guidebook

With DSM-5, several additional changes have been made. First, each disorder has
also been provided with a dual “Z code” diagnosis, the letter used in the coding for
these conditions in ICD-10-CM, expected to become operational in October 2014. As
with the letter _V,_ the letter _Z_ has no special significance in this context. Hence, in this
chapter, and throughout the book, we refer to these conditions as “V/Z code” diagno-
ses. In confirmed or suspected cases of child, spouse/partner, or adult neglect, or psy-
chological, physical, or sexual violence, a 995 code is used (a T code in the ICD-10-CM
system).
With the discontinuation of the multiaxial diagnostic scheme, stressors that for-
merly would have been recorded on Axis IV may now be recognized by using the V/
Z codes. The expanded list in DSM-5 allows for a more complete description of situ-
ations that are relevant to seeking care but are not attributable to a mental illness, such
as homelessness, extreme poverty, or being the victim of a crime.
A listing of other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention, along with
ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes, is given in Table 19–2.

Relational Problems

To encourage the use of these diagnoses by clinicians, the section was reorganized and
expanded for DSM-5. Relational problems are accorded much greater specificity, and in-
stead of five diagnoses as in DSM-IV, there are now eight. This category concerns pat-
terns of interaction between members of a relational unit. The patterns are associated
with symptoms or significant impairment in functioning in one or more individual
members or with significant impairment of the relational unit itself. The category should
be of special interest to clinicians engaged in family and couples therapy.
Key relationships, especially intimate adult partner relationships and parent/
caregiver–child relationships have a significant impact on the health of the individu-
als in these relationships. These relationships can be health promoting and protective,
neutral, or detrimental to health outcomes. In the extreme, these close relationships can
be associated with maltreatment or neglect, which has significant medical and psycho-
logical consequences for the affected individual. A relational problem may come to
clinical attention either as the reason that the individual seeks health care or as a prob-
lem that affects the course, prognosis, or treatment of the individual’s mental or other
medical disorder.

Abuse and Neglect

The section on problems related to abuse or neglect was added in DSM-IV in part due
to the clinical and public health significance of the conditions. This section has been
further expanded in DSM-5. Readers should note that different diagnostic codes are
given on the basis of the focus of clinical attention. If the problem is addressed in the
context of the family or relational unit, the V/Z code is used. If the focus is on the vic-
tim, the 995 code (or a T code in ICD-10-CM) is used.
Maltreatment by a family member (e.g., caregiver, intimate adult partner) or by a
nonrelative can be the area of current clinical focus, or such maltreatment can be an
important factor in the assessment and treatment of patients with mental or other
medical disorders. Because of the legal implications of abuse and neglect, care should


**422** DSM-5 Guidebook

be used in assessing these conditions and assigning these codes. Having a past history
of abuse or neglect can influence diagnosis and treatment response in a number of
mental disorders, and may also be noted along with the diagnosis.

Child Maltreatment and Neglect Problems

**Child Physical Abuse**

Child physical abuse is nonaccidental physical injury to a child—ranging from minor
bruises to severe fractures or death—occurring as a result of punching, beating, kick-
ing, biting, shaking, throwing, stabbing, choking, hitting (with a hand, stick, strap, or
other object), burning, or any other method that is inflicted by a parent, caregiver, or
other individual who has responsibility for the child. Such injury is considered abuse
regardless of whether the caregiver intended to hurt the child. Physical discipline, such
as spanking or paddling, is not considered abuse as long as it is reasonable and causes
no bodily injury to the child.

tal child abuse

**Child Sexual Abuse**

Child sexual abuse encompasses any sexual act involving a child that is intended to
provide sexual gratification to a parent, caregiver, or other individual who has re-
sponsibility for the child. Sexual abuse includes activities such as fondling a child’s
genitals, penetration, incest, rape, sodomy, and indecent exposure. Sexual abuse also
includes noncontact exploitation of a child by a parent or caregiver—for example,
forcing, tricking, enticing, threatening, or pressuring a child to participate in acts for
the sexual gratification of others, without direct physical contact between child and
abuser.

**Child Neglect**

Child neglect is defined as any confirmed or suspected egregious act or omission by
a child’s parent or other caregiver that deprives the child of basic age-appropriate
needs and thereby results, or has reasonable potential to result, in physical or psycho-
logical harm to the child. Child neglect encompasses abandonment; lack of appropri-
ate supervision; failure to attend to necessary emotional or psychological needs; and
failure to provide necessary education, medical care, nourishment, shelter, and/or
clothing.

**Child Psychological Abuse**

Child psychological abuse is nonaccidental verbal or symbolic acts by a child’s parent
or caregiver that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in significant psycho-
logical harm to the child. (Physical and sexual abusive acts are not included in this


**424** DSM-5 Guidebook

category.) Examples of psychological abuse of a child include berating, disparaging,
or humiliating the child; threatening the child; harming/abandoning—or indicating
that the alleged offender will harm/abandon—people or things that the child cares
about; confining the child (as by tying a child’s arms or legs together or binding a
child to furniture or another object, or confining a child to a small enclosed area [e.g.,
a closet]); egregious scapegoating of the child; coercing the child to inflict pain on
himself or herself; and disciplining the child excessively (i.e., at an extremely high fre-
quency or duration, even if not at a level of physical abuse) through physical or non-
physical means.

Adult Maltreatment and Neglect Problems

**Spouse or Partner Violence, Physical**

This category should be used when nonaccidental acts of physical force that result, or
have reasonable potential to result, in physical harm to an intimate partner or that
evoke significant fear in the partner have occurred during the past year. Nonacciden-
tal acts of physical force include shoving, slapping, hair pulling, pinching, restrain-
ing, shaking, throwing, biting, kicking, hitting with the fist or an object, burning,
poisoning, applying force to the throat, cutting off the air supply, holding the head
under water, and using a weapon. Acts for the purpose of physically protecting one-
self or one’s partner are excluded.

**Spouse or Partner Violence, Sexual**

This category should be used when forced or coerced sexual acts with an intimate
partner have occurred during the past year. Sexual violence may involve the use of
physical force or psychological coercion to compel the partner to engage in a sexual
act against his or her will, whether or not the act is completed. Also included in this
category are sexual acts with an intimate partner who is unable to consent.

**Spouse or Partner Neglect**

Partner neglect is any egregious act or omission in the past year by one partner that
deprives a dependent partner of basic needs and thereby results, or has reasonable po-
tential to result, in physical or psychological harm to the dependent partner. This cat-
egory is used in the context of relationships in which one partner is extremely
dependent on the other partner for care or for assistance in navigating ordinary daily
activities—for example, a partner who is incapable of self-care owing to substantial
physical, psychological/intellectual, or cultural limitations (e.g., inability to commu-
nicate with others and manage everyday activities due to living in a foreign culture).

**Spouse or Partner Abuse, Psychological**

Partner psychological abuse encompasses nonaccidental verbal or symbolic acts by
one partner that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in significant harm to
the other partner. This category should be used when such psychological abuse has
occurred during the past year. Acts of psychological abuse include berating or humil-
iating the victim; interrogating the victim; restricting the victim’s ability to come and
go freely; obstructing the victim’s access to assistance (e.g., law enforcement; legal,
protective, or medical resources); threatening the victim with physical harm or sexual
assault; harming, or threatening to harm, people or things that the victim cares about;
unwarranted restriction of the victim’s access to or use of economic resources; isolat-
ing the victim from family, friends, or social support resources; stalking the victim; and
trying to make the victim think that he or she is crazy.

**Adult Abuse by Nonspouse or Nonpartner**

This category should be used when an adult has been abused by another adult who
is not an intimate partner. Such maltreatment may involve acts of physical, sexual, or
emotional abuse. Examples of adult abuse include nonaccidental acts of physical
force (e.g., pushing/shoving, scratching, slapping, throwing something that could
hurt, punching, biting) that have resulted—or have reasonable potential to result—in
physical harm or have caused significant fear; forced or coerced sexual acts; and ver-
bal or symbolic acts with the potential to cause psychological harm (e.g., berating or
humiliating the person; interrogating the person; restricting the person’s ability to come
and go freely; obstructing the person’s access to assistance; threatening the person;
harming or threatening to harm people or things that the person cares about; restrict-


**_Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Conditions_** **427**

ing the person’s access to or use of economic resources; isolating the person from fam-
ily, friends, or social support resources; stalking the person; trying to make the person
think that he or she is crazy). Acts for the purpose of physically protecting oneself or
the other person are excluded.

Housing and Economic Problems

This is a new category created to acknowledge housing and economic problems that
many individuals experience. There are nine codes available to help describe the in-
dividual’s problem(s): homelessness; inadequate housing; discord with neighbor,
lodger, or landlord; problem related to living in a residential institution; lack of ade-
quate food or safe drinking water; extreme poverty; low income; insufficient social in-
surance or welfare support; and unspecified housing or economic problem.

Other Problems Related to the

Social Environment

There are six codes available in this category to better describe the individual’s life tran-
sition, social, and living problems: phase of life problem; problem related to living alone;
acculturation difficulty; social exclusion or rejection; target of (perceived) adverse dis-
crimination or persecution; and unspecified problem related to social environment.

Problems Related to Crime or

Interaction With the Legal System

This category is new and can be used to describe the individual’s problem(s) with the
legal system: victim of crime; conviction in civil or criminal proceedings without im-
prisonment; imprisonment or other incarceration; problems related to release from
prison; and problems related to other legal circumstances.

V62.5 (Z65.3) Problems Related to Other Legal Circumstances

Other Health Service Encounters for

Counseling and Medical Advice

There are two codes available for use in individuals who seek sex counseling or other
counseling or consultation. While they may not have a mental illness, some persons will
seek counseling to receive sex education, to discuss problems related to their sexual
orientation (or their partners’), and other issues. Many people will also seek counsel-
ing for various reasons unrelated to mental health, such as spiritual counseling or di-
etary counseling.

V65.49 (Z70.9) Sex Counseling
V65.40 (Z71.9) Other Counseling or Consultation

Problems Related to Other Psychosocial,

Personal, and Environmental Circumstances

Eight codes are available in this category that includes problems related to psychoso-
cial, personal, and environmental concerns: religious or spiritual problem; problems
related to unwanted pregnancy; problems related to multiparity; discord with social ser-
vice provider, including probation officer, case manager, or social services worker; victim
of terrorism or torture; exposure to disaster, war, or other hostilities; other problem
related to psychosocial circumstances; and unspecified problem related to unspeci-
fied psychosocial circumstances.

V62.89 (Z65.8) Other Problem Related to Psychosocial Circumstances
V62.9 (Z65.9) Unspecified Problem Related to Unspecified Psychosocial Circum-
stances

Other Circumstances of Personal History

This category includes 14 codes to further describe problems related to personal history:
other personal history of psychological trauma; personal history of self-harm; personal


**430** DSM-5 Guidebook

history of military deployment; other personal risk factors; problem related to lifestyle;
adult antisocial behavior; child or adolescent antisocial behavior; unavailability or inac-
cessibility of health care facilities; unavailability or inaccessibility of other helping agen-
cies; nonadherence to medical treatment; overweight or obesity; malingering; wandering
associated with a mental disorder; and borderline intellectual functioning.
Of the seven conditions listed below, adult antisocial behavior has the longest his-
tory. Although such behavior is troublesome to the individual and the community, it
is not considered a mental disorder. Some individuals engage in antisocial acts, but
their behavior does not meet the criteria for antisocial personality disorder or conduct
disorder. Examples include people who pursue criminal careers, prostitutes, and pro-
fessional thieves. In the process of differential diagnosis, the clinician will need to dis-
tinguish adult antisocial behavior from antisocial personality disorder. The person with
antisocial personality disorder will have a history of conduct disorder.

V69.9 (Z72.9) Problem Related to Lifestyle
V71.01 (Z72.811) Adult Antisocial Behavior
V71.02 (Z72.810) Child or Adolescent Antisocial Behavior

Problems Related to Access to Medical and

Other Health Care

Two codes are used to describe the unavailability or inaccessibility of health care fa-
cilities, or the unavailability or inaccessibility of other helping agencies. These prob-
lems may be particularly problematic in rural areas or remote regions where health
care facilities are inadequate or lacking altogether.

V63.9 (Z75.3) Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Health Care Facilities
V63.8 (Z75.4) Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Other Helping Agencies

Nonadherence to Medical Treatment

Nonadherence to medical treatment is common and interferes with the clinician’s abil-
ity to help a patient. Although nonadherence per se is not considered a mental disor-
der, clinicians need to have an understanding of treatment adherence in general, and
more specifically in individual patients, whose motivations, concerns, and other issues
affect adherence, such as an individual’s denial of illness or lack of insight or possibly
patient concerns about treatment side effects.
_Overweight or obesity_ is new to DSM-5 and is a significant problem for many indi-
viduals who seek mental health care. Research has long shown a relationship between
overweight/obesity and mental disorders, and the problem is gaining in importance
as this condition becomes more frequent in the general population. Many psychotro-
pic medications are known to contribute to obesity and its associated metabolic prob-
lems such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Including this category may lead to better


**_Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Conditions_** **431**

recognition and reporting of overweight and obesity. This problem is coded as 278.00
(E66.9) rather than with a V/Z code.
_Malingering_ is another problem clinicians encounter, and it involves the intentional
production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms moti-
vated by external incentives (e.g., avoiding military conscription or duty, avoiding
work, evading criminal prosecution). Malingering is important to consider in the pro-
cess of differential diagnosis and should be suspected when any of the following clues
are present: medicolegal context of presentation (e.g., the person is referred by an attor-
ney); marked discrepancy between the person’s claimed disability and objective find-
ings; lack of cooperation during the diagnostic evaluation and noncompliance with the
treatment regimen; and the presence of an antisocial personality disorder.
_Wandering_ associated with a mental disorder is new to DSM-5, and is a category
used to describe people whose tendency to walk about leads to significant clinical
management or safety concerns. For example, individuals with major neurocognitive
or neurodevelopmental disorders may experience a restless urge to wander that places
them at risk for falls and causes them to leave supervised settings without needed ac-
companiment. This category is not meant to be used in those individuals whose intent
is to escape an unwanted housing situation (e.g., children who are running away
from home, patients who no longer wish to remain in the hospital) or those who walk
or pace as a result of medication-induced akathisia. Nor should this category used to
describe the individual with antisocial personality disorder whose _wanderlust_ leads
him to move from place to place without any particular goal or destination other than
to perhaps dodge past crimes and identities.
The category _borderline intellectual functioning_ can be used when the individual’s sub-
normal cognitive performance is the focus of clinical attention or has an impact on the
individual’s treatment or prognosis. Differentiating between borderline intellectual
functioning and an intellectual disability requires careful assessment that must take into
account both intellectual and adaptive functioning. Unlike DSM-IV, there is no longer an
IQ range specified to help identify borderline intellectual functioning. This condition is
important to acknowledge because an individual may benefit from efforts to optimize

KEY POINTS

- The DSM-IV chapter “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention,”
    which included the V/Z/T code diagnoses, has been expanded for DSM-5, and
    the medication-induced movement disorders and other adverse effects of med-
    ication have been moved to their own chapter.


**432** DSM-5 Guidebook

- The codes included in this chapter are available to describe or denote condi-
    tions that are of clinical interest or concern but that are not considered mental
    disorders.
- Many of these conditions would have been listed on Axis IV of the multiaxial
    system in DSM-IV as “stressors” relevant to the care of the individual.
- Uncomplicated bereavement is available for use in bereaved individuals whose
    symptoms do not meet criteria for major depressive disorder.
- Overweight or obesity is a new category that may help lead to better recognition
    and reporting of this condition.
