## The major change in DSM-5 regarding mood disorders is that the

DSM-IV chapter of that name has been divided into two separate chapters: one for bi-
polar and related disorders and the other for depressive disorders. Both diagnostic
classes are reviewed in this chapter.
Mood disorders are highly prevalent, have high morbidity, and are associated
with early mortality and suicide. They are among the world’s most disabling ill-
nesses, as documented in _The Global Burden of Disease_ (Murray and Lopez 1996). Char-
acterized by prominent and prolonged disturbances of mood generally inappropriate
to the individual’s life situation, depression and mania are considered the primary
syndromes. Many symptoms occur in individuals with mood disorder, including in-
somnia, suicidal thoughts, anorexia, and feelings of being a burden to others in indi-


**90** DSM-5 Guidebook

viduals with depression, and euphoria, irritability, decreased need for sleep, and
hyperactivity in individuals with mania. In DSM-III, these conditions were collec-
tively referred to as _affective disorders,_ but they were renamed mood disorders for
DSM-III-R. The term _mood disorder_ is more appropriate because _affect_ refers to fluctu-
ating mood changes in emotional expression, whereas _mood_ refers to more sustained
and pervasive feeling states.
The mood disorders have been divided in many different ways over the years in
attempts to identify the best classification scheme. Although that goal has been elu-
sive, research and clinical experience both show that the fundamental symptoms of
mood disorders are depressed mood, elevated mood, or an admixture of the two.
Despite having a limited number of disorders, the two DSM-5 mood disorder chap-
ters are lengthy because of all the specifiers that can be used to provide greater detail
about an individual’s illness. These allow the clinician to record whether the current or
most recent episode is manic, hypomanic, or depressed; whether the mood disorder is
accompanied by anxious distress; whether there are mixed features, melancholic fea-
tures, atypical features, psychotic features, or catatonia; whether there is rapid cycling;
whether there is a peripartum onset; or whether there is a seasonal pattern.
Because mood symptoms are not specific to these diagnostic classes and are found
in many other psychiatric disorders, differential diagnosis is complicated. For exam-
ple, manic/hypomanic symptoms commonly occur in individuals with neurocogni-
tive disorders or in those with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders,
whereas depression is found to some extent in individuals with disorders as wide
ranging as adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Mood
symptoms are sometimes masked as complaints about insomnia, fatigue, or unex-
plained pain, which can further complicate the differential diagnosis.
Historically, mood disorders are among the oldest recognized psychiatric syn-
dromes, and have been included in nearly all diagnostic classification systems through
the centuries. Both depressive and bipolar conditions were included within the same
category in DSM-I (“manic depressive reaction”) and DSM-II (“manic-depressive ill-
ness”). All were classified as psychoses except one: mood syndromes precipitated by
stressful life experience. Later, unipolar and bipolar disorders were separated in re-
sponse to research showing that individuals with manic episodes have a fundamentally
different course and outcome than those who experience only depression. These new
concepts were reflected in the Feighner criteria (Feighner et al. 1972), the Research Di-
agnostic Criteria (Spitzer et al. 1975), and DSM-III. This fundamental distinction has
been fully accepted by psychiatric clinicians and researchers.
We begin with a review of the DSM-5 chapter on bipolar and related disorders,
which include those disorders listed in Table 5–1.

BIPOLAR AND RELATED DISORDERS

This diagnostic class recognizes disorders characterized by marked oscillations in mood,
activity, and behavior. The classic form of bipolar disorder was described by Kraepelin
as an illness that was episodic and nondeteriorating, in contrast to schizophrenia. Re-
search evidence has confirmed the existence of a milder form of the disorder, which was

listed in DSM-III as an atypical bipolar disorder and given its own category, bipolar II
disorder, in DSM-IV. In DSM-5, bipolar and related disorders are placed between the
chapters on schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders and the depressive
disorders in recognition of their place in bridging these diagnostic classes.
Several changes were made in the criteria for DSM-5, with the goal of improving
specificity and sensitivity of the bipolar diagnoses. One objective was to reduce the
delay from the onset of first symptoms to correct diagnosis. Because of misdiagnosis,
people with bipolar disorder often receive inappropriate treatments, such as antide-
pressant pharmacotherapy in the absence of mood stabilizers, and thus are exposed
to the risk of cycle acceleration or hypomanic/manic switches, mixed states, and sui-
cidal behaviors. Improving diagnostic precision is expected to increase recognition of
bipolarity among people presenting with depressed mood and increase the probabil-
ity of their receiving early treatment.
The Mood Disorders Work Group added the phrase “persistently increased goal-
directed activity or energy” to Criterion A for both mania and hypomania. This addi-
tion should make explicit the requirement that this hallmark symptom of bipolar I or
II disorder needs to be present for the diagnosis to be made. The work group also rec-
ommended deleting the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, mixed type, which required
the criteria for mania and major depressive episode to be met simultaneously. In-
stead, a “with mixed features” specifier has been added that can be applied to mania
or hypomania when depressive features are present. The requirement that both full
syndromes be present was difficult to employ and had the potential to lead clinicians
to ignore important mood symptoms that failed to meet full diagnostic threshold
(Cassano et al. 2004; Goldberg et al. 2009).
Another change is that mania or hypomania that emerges during antidepressant
treatment (a medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at full syndromal
level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is now considered sufficient
evidence for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
In summary, these changes reflect refinements aimed at improving the recognition
and treatment of bipolar disorders by encouraging the clinician to observe and record
symptoms reflecting increased activity and mixed forms of mania/hypomania and
depression to consider in treatment decisions and future patient follow-up. Addition-
ally, people with substance-induced conditions that persist beyond the action of a
medication or substance will now receive a bipolar diagnosis.

Manic Episode

Diagnostic Criteria for Manic Episode

For a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the following criteria for a
manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed
by hypomanic or major depressive episodes.

A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable
mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least
1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospital-
ization is necessary).
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or
more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a
significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:

1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant exter-
    nal stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)
    or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-
    quences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or
    foolish business investments).
C. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social
or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self
or others, or there are psychotic features.
D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.
**Note:** A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,
medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level be-
yond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic ep-
isode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.
**Note:** Criteria A–D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is
required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

Criterion A

The phrase “persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy” has been added
to ensure that changes in both mood and activity level are appropriately recognized.
Increased activity or energy is a core symptom of mania and hypomania. This change
is prompted by the concern that mild mania, hypomania, and subthreshold bipolar
features are often unrecognized or misdiagnosed as major depressive disorder when


**_Mood Disorders_** **93**

level of activity is not taken into account (Angst et al. 2011, 2012). Furthermore, be-
cause the clinician is often seeing the individual in the depressive state and attempt-
ing to assess mania retrospectively, it may be easier for the individual to recall periods
of increased activity than changes in mood that may be more subtle and ego-syntonic.
The addition of “persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy” will increase
specificity of the application of this diagnosis.
The wording has also been changed to acknowledge that these symptoms are
present “most of the day, nearly every day.” This helps clinicians distinguish mania
(and hypomania) from borderline personality disorder and the mood swings that
people with this condition typically report (i.e., very short-lived, usually involving a
change from feeling normal to suddenly feeling angry or depressed, and tending to
occur in response to a psychosocial stressor).

Criterion B

The wording “increased energy or activity” has been added to this criterion to empha-
size the importance of this symptom in distinguishing mania and hypomania. In addi-
tion, the wording “and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior” was added
to emphasize that mania and hypomania represent a change from the person’s usual
behavior, and constitute a distinct mood or mood state. Clearly, manic changes repre-
sent an alteration in conduct and behavior that is not normal for the individual, and that
is usually observable to others, especially family members distressed by the changes
noted in their loved one. Three or more of seven classic manic symptoms are required
for the diagnosis (four if the mood is only irritable).

Criterion C

This criterion is simplified from DSM-IV Criterion D. Mania is clearly impairing. Al-
though mild forms may be tolerated (and perhaps even desirable in some situations),
full-blown mania can be disastrous to the individual’s personal and professional life,
particularly when the individual makes bad decisions about his or her personal life
(e.g., infidelity, sexual promiscuity) or business (e.g., major purchases, personnel de-
cisions). Delusions and/or hallucinations (e.g., believing one is wealthy, has a special
religious mission, knows famous persons) may further influence a person’s behavior.

Criterion D

This criterion requires that the mania not be induced by a substance (e.g., drug of
abuse, medication, other treatment). There are many drugs that have been associated
with manic symptoms and need to be ruled out (e.g., stimulants, corticosteroids). The
notation that mania resulting from antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, elec-
troconvulsive therapy) and persisting “at a fully syndromal level beyond the physio-
logical effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and,
therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis” is new to DSM-5. By contrast, in DSM-IV, “manic-like
episodes” that were “clearly caused by somatic antidepressant treatment” were not
to be counted toward a bipolar I diagnosis.


**94** DSM-5 Guidebook

Specifiers

In DSM-5, the “with mixed features” specifier for mania, hypomania, and depressive
episodes has replaced the criteria in DSM-IV for bipolar I disorder, most recent episode
mixed. The criteria were often considered confusing, and therefore persons with de-
pressive symptoms may have been ignored and their symptoms unrecognized. Be-
cause a substantial proportion of individuals with bipolar disorder (and persons
whose symptoms meet criteria for a major depressive episode) also describe an admix-
ture of depressive (or manic) symptoms that are insufficient in number to meet the
DSM-IV definition of a mixed episode, the significance of the symptoms went unno-
ticed or the symptoms were altogether ignored. The presence of mixed symptoms is
important to recognize because it has been associated with course (earlier onset),
greater number of episodes, higher likelihoods of alcohol abuse and suicide attempts,
greater likelihood of rapid cycling, and greater likelihood of a lifetime diagnosis of bi-
polar disorder.

Hypomanic Episode

The criteria for hypomanic episode describe a mild form of mania that may be seen
either in the course of bipolar I disorder or as a regular part of bipolar II disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Hypomanic Episode

A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable
mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least
4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or
more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted,
represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a
significant degree:

1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant exter-
    nal stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)
    or psychomotor agitation.
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-
    quences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or
    foolish business investments).
C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is un-
characteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.
D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.


**_Mood Disorders_** **95**

E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occu-
pational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic fea-
tures, the episode is, by definition, manic.
F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment).
**Note:** A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,
medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond
the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic epi-
sode diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (partic-
ularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are
not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indica-
tive of a bipolar diathesis.
**Note:** Criteria A–F constitute a hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes are com-
mon in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

The criteria for hypomanic episode are mostly unchanged from DSM-IV other
than the added phrase “persistently increased activity or energy” in Criterion A, and
the added requirement that the changes be present “most of the day, nearly every
day,” also in Criterion A. Also new is the notation indicating that a hypomanic epi-
sode can result from antidepressant therapy, but that if only one or two symptoms are
present, the diagnosis is not justified.

Major Depressive Episode

See “Depressive Disorders” later in this chapter for criteria for and discussion of ma-
jor depressive episode.

Bipolar I Disorder

DSM-5 no longer includes six separate criteria sets for bipolar I disorder as in DSM-
IV. Emphasis is now given to the use of specifiers, as previously noted.

Diagnostic Criteria for Bipolar I Disorder

A. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode (Criteria A–D under “Manic
Episode” above).
B. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better ex-
plained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, de-
lusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorder.

**Coding and Recording Procedures**
The diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current or most recent
episode and its status with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features,
and remission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full


**96** DSM-5 Guidebook

criteria are currently met for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifi-
ers are only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a manic, hypomanic,
or major depressive episode. Codes are as follows:

In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: bi-
polar I disorder, type of current or most recent episode, severity/psychotic/remission
specifiers, followed by as many specifiers without codes as apply to the current or
most recent episode.

Bipolar II Disorder

Criteria for bipolar II disorder are relatively unchanged from DSM-IV except for mi-
nor editing. Emphasis is placed on the use of specifiers, as noted earlier in the chapter.

Diagnostic Criteria for Bipolar II Disorder **296.89 (F31.81)**

For a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, it is necessary to meet the criteria for a current or
past hypomanic episode and the following criteria for a current or past major depressive
episode.

A. Criteria have been met for at least one hypomanic episode (Criteria A–F under “Hy-
pomanic Episode”; see p. 94) and at least one major depressive episode (Criteria
A–C under “Major Depressive Episode”; see pp. 108–109).
B. There has never been a manic episode.
C. The occurrence of the hypomanic episode(s) and major depressive episode(s) is
not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform
disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spec-
trum and other psychotic disorder.
D. The symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent alternation
between periods of depression and hypomania causes clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding and Recording Procedures**
Bipolar II disorder has one diagnostic code: 296.89 (F31.81). Its status with respect to
current severity, presence of psychotic features, course, and other specifiers cannot
be coded but should be indicated in writing (e.g., 296.89 [F31.81] bipolar II disorder,
current episode depressed, moderate severity, with mixed features; 296.89 [F31.81]
bipolar II disorder, most recent episode depressed, in partial remission).

Specify current or most recent episode:
**Hypomanic
Depressed**

Specify if:
**With anxious distress** (DSM-5, p. 149)
**With mixed features** (DSM-5, pp. 149–150)
**With rapid cycling** (DSM-5, pp. 150–151)
**With mood-congruent psychotic features** (DSM-5, p. 152)
**With mood-incongruent psychotic features** (DSM-5, p. 152)
**With catatonia** (DSM-5, p. 152). **Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89
(F06.1).
**With peripartum onset** (DSM-5, pp. 152–153)
**With seasonal pattern** (DSM-5, pp. 153–154): Applies only to the pattern of major
depressive episodes.

Specify course if full criteria for a mood episode are not currently met:
**In partial remission** (DSM-5, p. 154)
**In full remission** (DSM-5, p. 154)


**98** DSM-5 Guidebook

Specify severity if full criteria for a mood episode are currently met:
**Mild** (DSM-5, p. 154)
**Moderate** (DSM-5, p. 154)
**Severe** (DSM-5, p. 154)

Cyclothymic Disorder

The individual with cyclothymic disorder has mild swings between the two poles of
depression and hypomania. In the hypomanic phase, the person appears to be high
but not so high as to be socially or professionally incapacitated. In the depressed
phase, the individual has symptoms of depression, but not severe enough to meet cri-
teria for a full major depressive episode. Thus, the individual with cyclothymic dis-
order tends to swing from high to low and may have chronic mild mood instability.
The disorder was first included in DSM-III and was derived from DSM-II (Amer-
ican Psychiatric Association 1968) cyclothymic personality, described as a “behavior
pattern [that is] manifested by recurring and alternating periods of depression and
elation” (p. 42). The move to the mood disorders chapter (“Affective Disorders” in
DSM-III) was made based on evidence that cyclothymic disorder was related to bipo-
lar disorder; for example, some individuals will develop manic episodes, whereas
others will develop major depressive episodes, and therefore meet criteria for either
a bipolar I or II disorder.
The DSM-5 criteria for cyclothymia are mostly unchanged from DSM-IV, but have
been edited for clarity. The major change has been to indicate that during the 2-year
period hypomanic and depressive symptoms have been present for “at least half the
time.” This is in addition to the existing requirement (in DSM-IV) that individuals
could not be without symptoms for “more than 2 months at a time.” The new word-
ing provides greater guidance to clinicians, and reinforces the concept of cyclothymia
being a relatively chronic and persistent mood disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Cyclothymic Disorder **301.13 (F34.0)**

A. For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been nu-
merous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic
episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for
a major depressive episode.
B. During the above 2-year period (1 year in children and adolescents), the hypoman-
ic and depressive periods have been present for at least half the time and the in-
dividual has not been without the symptoms for more than 2 months at a time.
C. Criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have never been met.
D. The symptoms in Criterion A are not better explained by schizoaffective disorder,
schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or
unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).


**_Mood Disorders_** **99**

F. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**With anxious distress** (see DSM-5, p. 149)

Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and

Related Disorder

The criteria for substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder derive from those for
DSM-IV substance-induced mood disorder but are specific to bipolar disorder. These
criteria are patterned after those for manic episode except that the bipolar disorder is
induced by a substance of abuse or a medication.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Bipolar and Related Disorder

A. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture
and is characterized by elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, with or without depressed
mood, or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both
(1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxica-
    tion or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
    Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a bipolar or related disorder that is not
substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent bipolar or relat-
ed disorder could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the ces-
sation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-in-
duced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/
medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medica-
tion]-induced bipolar and related disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with
the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and
the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced


**100** DSM-5 Guidebook

bipolar and related disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar
and related disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with
the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and
the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance]
use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there
is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the sub-
stance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the sub-
stance-induced bipolar and related disorder.

Specify if (see Table 16–1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders”
for diagnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.

Clinicians should note the potential for confusing this disorder with a bipolar I or
II disorder that emerges during antidepressant treatment. In substance/medication-
induced bipolar and related disorder, the symptoms are clearly associated with the
ingestion of a substance and do _not_ persist beyond the physiological effect of that
treatment. The opposite occurs in bipolar I or II disorder, in that a manic/hypomanic
episode emerging _during_ antidepressant treatment (medication, electroconvulsive
therapy) and persisting at the full syndromal level for a _substantial period of time_ after
the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication is evidence of bipolarity.

Bipolar and Related Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

The criteria for bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition are pat-
terned after the DSM-IV criteria for mood disorder due to a general medical condition


**_Mood Disorders_** **101**

but are specific to bipolar disorder. In this case, the manic or hypomanic episode has
been attributed to a medical condition.

Diagnostic Criteria for Bipolar and Related Disorder
Due to Another Medical Condition

A. A prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable
mood and abnormally increased activity or energy that predominates in the clinical
picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the dis-
turbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning, or necessitates hospitalization
to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for bipolar and related disorder due to another
medical condition is **293.83,** which is assigned regardless of the specifier. The ICD-
10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below).

Specify if:
**(F06.33) With manic features:** Full criteria are not met for a manic or hypomanic
episode.
**(F06.33) With manic- or hypomanic-like episode:** Full criteria are met except
Criterion D for a manic episode or except Criterion F for a hypomanic episode.
**(F06.34) With mixed features:** Symptoms of depression are also present but do
not predominate in the clinical picture.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the
mental disorder (e.g., 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with
manic features). The other medical condition should also be coded and listed sepa-
rately immediately before the bipolar and related disorder due to the medical condition
(e.g., 242.90 [E05.90] hyperthyroidism; 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder due to hyper-
thyroidism, with manic features).

Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder

and Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder

The diagnoses other specified bipolar and related disorder and unspecified bipolar
and related disorder are residual categories that replace DSM-IV’s bipolar disorder
not otherwise specified.
The category other specified bipolar and related disorder is used for individuals
with symptoms characteristic of a bipolar or related disorder that cause distress or
impairment but do not meet the full criteria for a more specific disorder. In this case,
the clinician chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet


**102** DSM-5 Guidebook

full criteria. Clinicians are encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., short-dura-
tion hypomanic episodes [2-3 days] and major depressive episodes).
The category unspecified bipolar and related disorder is used when characteristic
symptoms are present that cause distress or impairment but these symptoms do not
meet full criteria for a more specific disorder, and the clinician chooses not to commu-
nicate the reason criteria for a more specific disorder are not met, or there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Bipolar and
Related Disorder **296.89 (F31.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar
and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class.
The other specified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does
not meet the criteria for any specific bipolar and related disorder. This is done by re-
cording “other specified bipolar and related disorder” followed by the specific reason
(e.g., “short-duration cyclothymia”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2–3 days) and major depressive episodes:**
    A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals whose pre-
    sentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have
    experienced two or more episodes of short-duration hypomania that meet the full
    symptomatic criteria for a hypomanic episode but that only last for 2–3 days. The ep-
    isodes of hypomanic symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive epi-
    sodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with
    mixed features.
2. **Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major depressive epi-**
    **sodes:** A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals
    whose presentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but
    who have experienced one or more episodes of hypomania that do not meet full
    symptomatic criteria (i.e., at least 4 consecutive days of elevated mood and one or
    two of the other symptoms of a hypomanic episode, or irritable mood and two or
    three of the other symptoms of a hypomanic episode). The episodes of hypomanic
    symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive episodes, so the distur-
    bance does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with mixed features.
3. **Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive episode:** One or more hy-
    pomanic episodes in an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria
    for a major depressive episode or a manic episode. If this occurs in an individual
    with an established diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), both
    diagnoses can be concurrently applied during the periods when the full criteria for
    a hypomanic episode are met.


**_Mood Disorders_** **103**

4. **Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 24 months):** Multiple episodes of hypo-
    manic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and multiple ep-
    isodes of depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive
    episode that persist over a period of less than 24 months (less than 12 months for
    children or adolescents) in an individual whose presentation has never met full cri-
    teria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and does not meet crite-
    ria for any psychotic disorder. During the course of the disorder, the hypomanic or
    depressive symptoms are present for more days than not, the individual has not been
    without symptoms for more than 2 months at a time, and the symptoms cause clini-
    cally significant distress or impairment.

Unspecified Bipolar and
Related Disorder **296.80 (F31.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar and
related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full cri-
teria for any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clini-
cian chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific bipolar
and related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information
to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS

The DSM-5 depressive disorders are listed in Table 5–2. There are two new diagnoses:
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A new
specifier to indicate the presence of mixed symptoms has been added across the depres-
sive disorders. The core criterion items applied to the diagnosis major depressive dis-
order, as well as its 2-week duration, are unchanged from DSM-IV, although minor
editing changes have been made. The Mood Disorders Work Group concluded that the
major depressive disorder criteria, which were introduced in DSM-III and which had
accumulated considerable research support, have held up well over the past 30 years.
One important change is the omission of the so-called bereavement exclusion.
This change led to unwanted controversy whereby critics claimed it would medical-
ize the normal process of bereavement. In DSM-IV, major depressive episode Crite-
rion E required that the symptoms be “not better accounted for by Bereavement.”
This exclusion applied to symptoms lasting less than 2 months following the death of
a loved one. The change for DSM-5 was made because evidence does not support the
separation of loss of a loved one from other stressors in terms of its likelihood of pre-
cipitating a major depressive episode or in terms of the relative likelihood that the
symptoms will remit spontaneously. Bereavement is a severe psychosocial stressor
known to precipitate major depressive episodes in vulnerable persons. Typically, when


**104** DSM-5 Guidebook

that happens, the depression begins soon after the loss. Although bereavement may
be painful, most persons do not develop a major depressive episode. Those who do,
however, typically experience more suffering, feel worthless, and may have suicidal
ideation. General medical health can suffer, as can interpersonal and work function.
These individuals can be at risk for “complicated grief,” characterized by ruminating
about the deceased person, seeking proximity to the deceased person, and striving to
avoid experiences that trigger reminders of loss. Furthermore, bereavement-related
depression has most of the characteristics of a major depressive episode; that is, it is
most likely to occur in individuals with past personal and family history of a major
depressive episode, is genetically influenced, and is associated with similar personal-
ity characteristics, patterns of comorbidity, and outcome. Finally, the symptoms asso-
ciated with a bereavement-related major depressive disorder respond to antidepres-
sant medication. Depending on the particular circumstances, the clinician observing
a full depressive syndrome in an individual within the first 2 months following the
death of a loved one can elect to observe rather than initiate treatment.
The coexistence within a major depressive episode of at least three manic/hypo-
manic symptoms insufficient to satisfy criteria for a manic/hypomanic episode is now
acknowledged with the specifier “with mixed features.” This change recognizes find-
ings from family and follow-up studies that show that the presence of mixed features
in an episode of major depressive disorder increases the likelihood that the illness falls
within the bipolar spectrum. The presence of a full manic syndrome within a depres-
sive episode will continue to be an exclusion criterion for a depressive disorder diag-
nosis, and individuals with this pattern will be considered to have a bipolar disorder.
The addition of _disruptive mood dysregulation disorder_ and _premenstrual dysphoric
disorder_ has generated controversy, although of a different order of magnitude than
that pertaining to the bereavement exclusion. Disruptive mood dysregulation disor-
der was created in part to address concerns about the possible overdiagnosis of bipo-
lar disorder in children younger than 12 years who display persistent irritability and
frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol (Axelson et al. 2006). On the other
hand, premenstrual dysphoric disorder was moved from Appendix B of DSM-IV (“Cri-
teria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study”) to become a stand-alone diagnosis
following a careful literature review.

**TABLE 5–2. DSM-5 depressive disorders**

**_Mood Disorders_** **105**

There has been some controversy about the premenstrual dysphoric disorder di-
agnosis through the years. Some groups have felt that a disorder that focuses on the
menstrual cycle may “pathologize” normal reproductive functioning. Others have
believed that the disorder serves to stigmatize women’s health, and perhaps implies
that women would not be able to perform needed activities during the premenstrual
phase of the cycle. Because the disorder is common and problematic, work group
members concluded that it would be inappropriate _not_ to acknowledge the condition
or encourage clinicians to recognize the disorder and offer appropriate treatment.
Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is new to DSM-5 and merges DSM-IV-
defined chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major depressive
disorder may precede persistent depressive disorder, and major depressive episodes
may occur during persistent depressive disorder. There is no longer a requirement
that the disturbance not occur exclusively during the course of a chronic psychotic dis-
order, such as schizophrenia or delusional disorder (DSM-IV Criterion F). This change
allows clinicians to diagnose persistent depressive disorder in persons with one of
these psychotic conditions.
In summary, the depressive disorders chapter reflects refinements aimed at im-
proving the recognition and treatment of these conditions by encouraging the clini-
cian to record and consider specifiers that allow coverage of important information
not conveyed by the categorical diagnoses themselves. New diagnoses have been
added that address problems that are common and have been inadequately covered
in DSM, yet are associated with significant distress and impairment, and merit recog-
nition and special clinical management.

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder

The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will help fill an important
gap for children with mood dysregulation characterized by chronic, severe persistent
irritability. In the past 20 years, there has been a 40-fold increase in the number of
youth diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Research, however, shows that children with
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have a different outcome, gender ratio, and
family history than those with bipolar disorder. Furthermore, they do not go on to de-
velop manic or hypomanic episodes. While impaired, these children often have
symptoms that meet criteria for other disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disor-
ders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The Childhood and Adolescent
Disorders Work Group concluded that the best fit was with the depressive disorders.
Initially, the work group considered naming the disorder “temper dysregulation
disorder” but in response to feedback chose to name it “disruptive mood dysregula-
tion disorder.” Because most of the children who meet criteria for this new disorder
will also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder (due to overlapping symp-
toms), the work group decided that youth who meet criteria for both disorders should
be assigned only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. This
avoids the problem of having artificial comorbidity due to overlapping criteria.


**106** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Disruptive Mood
Dysregulation Disorder **296.99 (F34.8)**

A. Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g., verbal rages) and/or
behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly
out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation.
B. The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level.
C. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week.
D. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the
day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
E. Criteria A–D have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the
individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all of
the symptoms in Criteria A–D.
F. Criteria A and D are present in at least two of three settings (i.e., at home, at
school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these.
G. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18
years.
H. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria A–E is before 10 years.
I. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the
full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been
met.
**Note:** Developmentally appropriate mood elevation, such as occurs in the context
of a highly positive event or its anticipation, should not be considered as a symp-
tom of mania or hypomania.
J. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive dis-
order and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent de-
pressive disorder [dysthymia]).
**Note:** This diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent
explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder, though it can coexist with others, including
major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disor-
der, and substance use disorders. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for
both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder
should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an
individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned.
K. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to
another medical or neurological condition.

Criteria A and B

This item notes that the child has “severe recurrent _temper outbursts_ ...that are grossly
out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation” (emphasis
added). Because nearly all children have temper tantrums, this criterion is needed to
help distinguish ordinary tantrums from outbursts that stand apart due to their se-


**_Mood Disorders_** **107**

verity and regularity. Furthermore, the outbursts are inconsistent with the situation,
and most parents would see these as indicating the child is out of control. Also, the
outbursts are manifested verbally and/or behaviorally, such as in a tantrum, and are
not consistent with the child’s developmental level (i.e., the child is outside the range
of the “terrible twos”).

Criteria C, D, and E

The requirement that temper outbursts occur three or more times per week is some-
what arbitrary, but the point is that the outbursts occur regularly and with some fre-
quency. Between outbursts the child’s mood is persistently irritable or angry “most of
the day, nearly every day.” In other words, the symptoms are not just a passing phase.
These symptoms have been present for 12 or more months, during which time the
child has not had at least 3 consecutive months without all of the symptoms in Crite-
ria A–D. This item also indicates that the symptoms do not represent a temporary
phase, but are pervasive and lasting.

Criterion F

The symptoms occur in at least two settings, such as at home and school. Some chil-
dren seem to turn symptoms on and off at will, and this criterion separates those chil-
dren in whom the symptoms seem voluntary from those who seem less likely to be
able to control themselves.

Criteria G and H

This diagnosis is not made before the child is age 6 years nor after the youth turns age
18 years (Criterion G). This criterion helps to establish that the temper outbursts are
not attributable to a neurodevelopmental syndrome, in which the symptoms would
likely have an earlier onset, and are not attributable to adult misbehavior from an an-
tisocial personality disorder, which is not diagnosed in persons under age 18 years.
Onset is before age 10 years (Criterion H). Again, this criterion helps guard against
using the diagnosis to justify a bipolar diagnosis, which generally has an onset during
adolescence or beyond.

Criteria I, J, and K

Criterion I helps separate disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar dis-
order by excluding individuals with symptoms that meet the full criteria for a manic
or hypomanic episode for more than 1 day. Also, the item recognizes, in a note, that
some “developmentally appropriate” episodes of mood elevation can occur in the
context of a highly positive event or its anticipation (e.g., a birthday party, a visit to
an amusement park) and should not be confused with bipolar disorder.
Criteria J and K ensure that the temper outbursts do not occur exclusively during
a major depressive episode and are not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., autism spectrum disorder), and that the symptoms are not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance or to another medical or neurological condition.


**108** DSM-5 Guidebook

It is further noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot coexist with
oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder. On
the other hand, it may coexist with some other mental disorders, such as major de-
pressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and sub-
stance use disorders.
If the child’s symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation dis-
order and oppositional defiant disorder, the former diagnosis trumps the latter. Re-
search shows that most children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will
also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, but the
reverse is not true. Only about 15% of children with oppositional defiant disorder will
have symptoms that also meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Major Depressive Episode

The syndrome major depressive episode described in DSM-III continues in DSM-5
nearly unchanged apart from editing changes, except for the bereavement exclusion
and several new specifiers to help clinicians better describe an individual’s episode
(see “Depressive Disorders” introduction above). Major depressive disorder is the
codable disorder for people with one or more major depressive episodes. Major de-
pressive disorders are coded based on whether only a single major depressive episode
has occurred or the episodes are recurrent.

Diagnostic Criteria for Major Depressive Episode

A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-
week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the
symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.
**Note:** Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical con-
dition.

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either sub-
    jective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others
    (e.g., appears tearful). ( **Note:** In children and adolescents, can be irritable
    mood.)
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of
    the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or obser-
    vation).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more
    than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly
    every day. ( **Note:** In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others,
    not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be


**_Mood Disorders_** **109**

```
delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being
sick).
```
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day
    (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation
    without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing sui-
    cide.
B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to an-
other medical condition.
**Note:** Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode.
**Note:** Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from
a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of
intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss
noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symp-
toms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a
major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss
should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of
clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the ex-
pression of distress in the context of loss.^1
D. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional dis-
order, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-
chotic disorders.
E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.
**Note:** This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like epi-
sodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of an-
other medical condition.

(^1) In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in
grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent
depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief
is likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs
of grief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The
depressed mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupa-
tions. The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are unchar-
acteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of MDE. The thought content
associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the
deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in MDE. In grief, self-
esteem is generally preserved, whereas in MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are
common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings
vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much
he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts
are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in
MDE such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless, unde-
serving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.


**110** DSM-5 Guidebook

**Coding and Recording Procedures**
The diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether this is a single
or recurrent episode, current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission
status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are cur-
rently met for a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if
the full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes are as fol-
lows:

In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: ma-
jor depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission
specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to
the current episode.

Specify:
**With anxious distress** (DSM-5, p. 184)
**With mixed features** (DSM-5, pp. 184–185)
**With melancholic features** (DSM-5, p. 185)
**With atypical features** (DSM-5, pp. 185–186)
**With mood-congruent psychotic features** (DSM-5, p. 186)
**With mood-incongruent psychotic features** (DSM-5, p. 186)
**With catatonia** (DSM-5, p. 186). **Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89

Criterion A

This item specifies that five or more of nine depressive symptoms must be present for
a diagnosis of major depressive episode to be given, and at least one must be criterion
A1 (depressed mood) or A2 (loss of interest or pleasure). This list has remained un-
changed since DSM-III-R and contains the classic depressive symptoms recognized for


**_Mood Disorders_** **111**

centuries. Although individual symptoms are common in the general population, the
fact that they cluster together over a minimum of 2 weeks to form the syndrome sets
the diagnosis apart. It is important for clinicians to note that each item must be present
during the 2-week period before it is counted as “present.” Some symptoms that may
have been present before the onset of the episode count only if they become apprecia-
bly worse during the episode. For example, some individuals have chronic insomnia
that would otherwise not count unless it worsens as part of the depressive illness.
The most important symptoms are depressed mood (Criterion A1) and loss of in-
terest or pleasure (criterion A2), and one of the two is required. Some depressed indi-
viduals will have lost the ability to describe their emotions (alexithymia) or to feel
that they are depressed; others have trouble acknowledging depressed mood for cul-
tural or other reasons. In almost all cases, the person will be able to admit to loss of
interest or pleasure. Criterion A8 can be vexing because many disorders can cause
poor concentration. Many individuals with mild or early forms of dementia will re-
port memory impairment and difficulty concentrating. That said, the most important
cause of these symptoms is depression and not dementia.
Suicidal thoughts or behaviors (criterion A9) are the most worrisome of the de-
pressive symptoms, and once these are ascertained, the clinician will need to explore
this symptom at greater length to determine the individual’s degree of suicidality and
the urgency of medical intervention.
Clinicians should note that there must be an interval of at least 2 months in which
criteria are _not_ met for two major depressive episodes to be considered separate and
independent episodes.

Criterion B

Originally Criterion C in DSM-IV, this criterion states that depressive symptoms must
cause “clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning.” This criterion, added to the diagnosis in DSM-IV, is
supplemented by the specifiers of mild, moderate, and severe. Although depression
is perceived by most as distressing, the social and occupational impairment may
manifest in a variety of ways. The individual may have poor job performance due to
impaired concentration or being overly tired and therefore being inefficient at work.
He or she may take too many sick days or not show up. In the social arena, the person
may ignore friendships and become withdrawn; irritability may drive off remaining
friends. Families may suffer because the person ignores household tasks due to lack
of motivation. In severe cases, individuals may become preoccupied with thoughts of
death or dying, or develop suicidal plans; some will attempt (or complete) suicide.

Criterion C

Alternative explanations for the syndrome must be eliminated during the process of
differential diagnosis. Substances of abuse, medications, and other medical condi-
tions need to be ruled out. Alcohol and other drugs are known to induce depression;
in such cases, the appropriate diagnosis is substance/medication-induced depressive
disorder. Likewise, medical conditions such as hypothyroidism are associated with


**112** DSM-5 Guidebook

depression and need to be ruled out as the cause; in these cases, the more appropriate
diagnosis is depressive disorder due to another medical condition. These conditions
will have important treatment implications.

Criterion D

The depression is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder and is not superim-
posed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other
specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. All of
these disorders may be accompanied to some extent by the presence of depression.

Criterion E

The individual has never had a manic or a hypomanic episode. This criterion is im-
portant because it helps to separate major depressive disorder from bipolar disorder.
This distinction is fundamental to the mood disorders and has important treatment im-
plications. That said, for individuals with subsyndromal manic or hypomanic symp-
toms, the specifier “with mixed features” is available.

Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode

Specifiers

The specifiers allow the clinician to describe the individual’s illness in great detail, in-
cluding recording whether the mood disorder is accompanied by anxious distress;
whether there are mixed features, melancholic features, atypical features, psychotic
features, or catatonia; and whether the depression had a peripartum onset or has a
seasonal pattern. Clinicians can rate the major depressive episode as mild, moderate,
or severe and as with or without psychotic features.
The DSM-IV specifier “with postpartum onset” has been changed to “with peri-
partum onset.” This change acknowledges that half of major depressive episodes oc-
cur _prior_ to delivery. The specifier is appropriate for when a major depressive episode
develops during pregnancy or during the 4 weeks following delivery.

Major Depressive Disorder,

Recurrent Episode

For a major depressive disorder to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval
of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not
met for a major depressive episode.

Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)

Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is a chronic and persistent disturbance in
mood present for at least 2 years (or at least 1 year for children and adolescents) and


**_Mood Disorders_** **113**

characterized by relatively typical depressive symptoms, such as anorexia, insomnia,
decreased energy, low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of hopeless-
ness. The diagnosis merges DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and
dysthymic disorder. Clinicians had trouble distinguishing the two disorders, and
consolidating the disorders will make it easier to identify individuals with chronic
and persistent depression.
Dysthymic disorder was introduced in DSM-III and was referred to parentheti-
cally as depressive neurosis. Individuals with a persistent depressive disorder often
develop relatively more severe major depressive episodes. When the major depres-
sive episode clears, these individuals subsequently return to their chronic state of
dysthymia. The coexistence of both mild and severe forms of depression is sometimes
referred to as “double depression” because both disorders are coded.
The criteria for persistent depressive disorder are mostly unchanged from those
for DSM-IV dysthymic disorder. The most important difference affects Criterion D.
DSM-IV specified the _absence_ of any major depressive episode in the first 2 years of
the disturbance. The Mood Disorders Work Group was concerned that clinicians were
unable to reliably distinguish dysthymic disorder from chronic major depressive dis-
order. Many clinicians were confused about the differences and tended to ignore one
or the other diagnosis. Part of the confusion stems from the fact that patients are
asked to recall information that most individuals are unable to retrieve. That is, does
the patient recall having had in that 2-year period (that could have been decades in
the past) any symptom-free periods longer than 2 months in duration, or having had
2 weeks or more in which he or she had symptoms that met criteria for a major de-
pressive episode (in which case the patient would receive the diagnosis major depres-
sive disorder). These changes should help clinicians distinguish these disorders more
reliably. Research also showed that there were few differences among individuals
with dysthymic disorder and those with chronic major depressive disorder in symp-
toms, family history, or treatment response (Klein et al. 2004; McCullough et al. 2000).

Diagnostic Criteria for Persistent Depressive
Disorder (Dysthymia) **300.4 (F34.1)**

This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive
disorder and dysthymic disorder.

A. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as indicated by either
subjective account or observation by others, for at least 2 years.
**Note:** In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at
least 1 year.

B. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following:

1. Poor appetite or overeating.
2. Insomnia or hypersomnia.
3. Low energy or fatigue.
4. Low self-esteem.


**114** DSM-5 Guidebook

5. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions.
6. Feelings of hopelessness.

C. During the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents) of the disturbance, the
individual has never been without the symptoms in Criteria A and B for more than 2
months at a time.
D. Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously present for 2 years.
E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode, and criteria have
never been met for cyclothymic disorder.
F. The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent schizoaffective disorder,
schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).
H. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include four symptoms that
are absent from the symptom list for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), a very
limited number of individuals will have depressive symptoms that have persisted longer
than 2 years but will not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. If full criteria
for a major depressive episode have been met at some point during the current epi-
sode of illness, they should be given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Other-
wise, a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive
disorder is warranted.

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

The Mood Disorders Work Group recommended that premenstrual dysphoric disor-
der receive full disorder status in DSM-5. In DSM-IV, it was included in Appendix B
and, if present, was coded as depressive disorder not otherwise specified. Since the
disorder was initially proposed in DSM-III-R as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder,
research evidence has accumulated and shown the disorder to be prevalent and to
cause significant distress and impairment. The work group felt that information on
the diagnosis, treatment, and validators of the disorder had matured to the point that
the disorder qualified for inclusion as an independent diagnosis.
Clinical research and epidemiological studies have shown that many women ex-
perience symptoms that begin during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and ter-
minate around the onset of menses. Additionally, these studies identified a subset of
women (about 2% in the community) who suffer intermittently from severe symptoms
associated with the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Women with these symptoms
have not been adequately covered in DSM. Including premenstrual dysphoric disor-
der helps ensure that clinicians will recognize the syndrome and that women with the
disorder will receive appropriate treatment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Premenstrual
Dysphoric Disorder **625.4 (N94.3)**

A. In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the
final week before the onset of menses, start to improve within a few days after the
onset of menses, and become minimal or absent in the week postmenses.
B. One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:

1. Marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings; feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or
    increased sensitivity to rejection).
2. Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts.
3. Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating
    thoughts.
4. Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge.
C. One (or more) of the following symptoms must additionally be present, to reach a
total of five symptoms when combined with symptoms from Criterion B above.
1. Decreased interest in usual activities (e.g., work, school, friends, hobbies).
2. Subjective difficulty in concentration.


**116** DSM-5 Guidebook

3. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy.
4. Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings.
5. Hypersomnia or insomnia.
6. A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control.
7. Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain,
    a sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain.
**Note:** The symptoms in Criteria A–C must have been met for most menstrual cycles
that occurred in the preceding year.
D. The symptoms are associated with clinically significant distress or interference with
work, school, usual social activities, or relationships with others (e.g., avoidance of
social activities; decreased productivity and efficiency at work, school, or home).
E. The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disor-
der, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, persistent depressive dis-
order (dysthymia), or a personality disorder (although it may co-occur with any of
these disorders).
F. Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least two
symptomatic cycles. ( **Note:** The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this
confirmation.)
G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition (e.g.,
hyperthyroidism).

Substance/Medication-Induced

Depressive Disorder

Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is diagnosed when an individ-
ual’s depressive symptoms have clearly resulted from the effect of a substance or
from its withdrawal. Such disorders occur commonly and have been associated with
particular substances, with alcohol being perhaps the most common incitant. The dis-
order is also frequently observed in hospital and clinic populations. The diagnostic
criteria are mostly unchanged from those for substance-induced mood disorder in
DSM-IV except that Criterion A has been edited to reflect the focus on depressive
symptoms, as is appropriate for this chapter. Coding depends on the substance impli-
cated as inducing the disorder. The name of the substance is included in the name of
the disorder (e.g., alcohol-induced depressive disorder).

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Depressive Disorder

A. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical
picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest
or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):


**_Mood Disorders_** **117**

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
    Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not sub-
stance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent depressive disor-
der could include the following:
The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms
persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of
acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the
existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced depressive disor-
der (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/med-
ication]-induced depressive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use dis-
order present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comor-
bid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,”
and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-
induced depressive disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced
depressive disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and
the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance]
use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the
substance-induced depressive disorder.

stance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
**With onset during withdrawal:** If criteria are met for withdrawal from the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.

Depressive Disorder Due to

Another Medical Condition

Some people develop depressive symptoms that are attributable to a known medical
disorder. These disorders are common, particularly in hospitals and consultation-
liaison services. Many physical disorders, such as hypothyroidism, are known to in-
duce depressive disorders. The DSM-5 criteria alert clinicians to the possibility that a
person’s depression is induced and that a search for a medical cause may be appro-
priate. For that reason, this diagnosis has important treatment implications.
The diagnosis may be further specified as with depressive features, with major de-
pressive–like episode, or with mixed features. In recording the diagnosis, the name of
the other medical condition should be included in the name of the disorder (e.g., de-
pressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with mixed features).

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for depressive disorder due to another medical
condition is **293.83,** which is assigned regardless of the specifier. The ICD-10-CM
code depends on the specifier (see below).

Specify if:
**(F06.31) With depressive features:** Full criteria are not met for a major depressive
episode.
**(F06.32) With major depressive–like episode:** Full criteria are met (except Crite-
rion C) for a major depressive episode.
**(F06.34) With mixed features** : Symptoms of mania or hypomania are also present
but do not predominate in the clinical picture.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental
disorder (e.g., 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depres-
sive features). The other medical condition should also be coded and listed separately im-
mediately before the depressive disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 244.9 [E03.9]
hypothyroidism; 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depres-
sive features).

Other Specified Depressive Disorder and

Unspecified Depressive Disorder

These categories replace DSM-IV’s depressive disorder not otherwise specified. The
category other specified depressive disorder is used when symptoms characteristic of
a depressive disorder are present and cause distress or impairment but do not meet the
full criteria for a more specific disorder in the class, and when the clinician chooses to
communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet full criteria. The clinician
is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., recurrent brief depression, short-dura-
tion depressive episode [4–13 days], depressive episode with insufficient symptoms).
The category unspecified depressive disorder is used when the the full criteria for
a more specific disorder are not met but symptoms cause clinically significant distress
or impairment, and the clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not
met, or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Depressive Disorder **311 (F32.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
any of the disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The other specified de-
pressive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any
specific depressive disorder. This is done by recording “other specified depressive dis-
order” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “short-duration depressive episode”).


**120** DSM-5 Guidebook

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Recurrent brief depression:** Concurrent presence of depressed mood and at
    least four other symptoms of depression for 2–13 days at least once per month
    (not associated with the menstrual cycle) for at least 12 consecutive months in an
    individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or
    bipolar disorder and does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psy-
    chotic disorder.
2. **Short-duration depressive episode (4–13 days):** Depressed affect and at least
    four of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with
    clinically significant distress or impairment that persists for more than 4 days, but less
    than 14 days, in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any
    other depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual cri-
    teria for any psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for recurrent brief de-
    pression.
3. **Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms:** Depressed affect and at least
    one of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with
    clinically significant distress or impairment that persist for at least 2 weeks in an
    individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or
    bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psy-
    chotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for mixed anxiety and depressive dis-
    order symptoms.

Unspecified Depressive Disorder **311 (F32.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depres-
sive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The un-
specified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific depressive
disorder, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make
a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- The mood disorders have been split into two chapters: “Bipolar and Related
    Disorders” and “Depressive Disorders.”
- The wording “persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy” has been
    added to Criterion A for manic episode and hypomanic episode. This should
    make explicit the requirement that this hallmark symptom of bipolar I or II dis-
    order needs to be present for the diagnosis to be made.


**_Mood Disorders_** **121**

- The diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, most recent episode mixed, which required
    criteria for both mania and major depressive episode to be met simultaneously,
    has been deleted. Instead, a “with mixed features” specifier has been added that
    can be applied to a manic episode or a hypomanic episode when depressive
    features are present.
- With the depressive disorders, an important change is the omission of the be-
    reavement exclusion that applied in DSM-IV to depressive symptoms lasting less
    than 2 months following the death of a loved one. This change was made because
    evidence does not support the separation of loss of a loved one from other stress-
    ors in terms of its likelihood of precipitating a major depressive episode.
- Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is new to the depressive disorders and
    describes the presentation of children with persistent irritability and behavioral
    dyscontrol. This change should help reduce the problem of overdiagnosis of bi-
    polar disorder in children and adolescents.
- Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is new and merges DSM-IV-defined
    chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Clinicians had trou-
    ble distinguishing the two disorders.
- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder has been elevated to a stand-alone diagnosis.
    The diagnosis applies to the presentation of women who develop a cluster of
    depressive symptoms in association with their menstrual cycle.
