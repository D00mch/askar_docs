Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome
Depressive Episodes With Short-Duration Hypomania
Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder
Caffeine Use Disorder
Internet Gaming Disorder
Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure
Suicidal Behavior Disorder
Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

## Section III of DSM-5 includes eight proposed disorders that may

be included in future DSM editions (Table 22–1). In this section, the DSM-5 authors
provide an opportunity for establishing standardized criteria to facilitate research that
might indicate whether a disorder should eventually be included as an official diag-
nosis. Inclusion of these criteria sets is “intended to provide a common language for
researchers and clinicians who are interested in studying these disorders” (American
Psychiatric Association 2013, p. 783). It is hoped that this will stimulate research that
may allow the field to better understand these conditions and inform decisions about
their placement in future DSM editions.
Placing provisional disorders in the manual began with DSM-III-R, which in-
cluded Appendix A, “Proposed Diagnostic Categories Needing Further Study.”
Three criteria sets were included: late luteal phase dysphoric disorder, sadistic per-
sonality disorder, and self-defeating personality disorder. Of these three, only late
luteal phase dysphoric disorder has gained the requisite recognition and research
support. It is included (with modification) in DSM-5 as premenstrual dysphoric dis-
order.
DSM-IV included 26 criteria sets, revised criteria, and axes in a much expanded
Appendix B (“Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study”). Each had been
recommended for inclusion in DSM-IV, but the task force concluded that insufficient

data existed to warrant their inclusion as official categories or axes. These included
proposed diagnoses (e.g., postconcussional disorder, dissociative trance disorder),
criteria (e.g., alternative Criterion B for dysthymic disorder), and axes (Defensive
Functioning Scale).
Of the conditions included in DSM-IV Appendix B, several have become stand-
alone diagnoses in DSM-5, a fact that demonstrates the utility of providing criteria to
stimulate research. Postconcussional disorder and mild neurocognitive disorder are
included in DSM-5, although the former has been reformulated as neurocognitive
disorder due to traumatic brain injury. Caffeine withdrawal, premenstrual dysphoric
disorder, factitious disorder by proxy (now factitious disorder imposed on another),
and binge-eating disorder are also included, in each instance with edits to their re-
spective criteria. On the other hand, several proposed disorders did not make the cut:
postpsychotic depressive disorder of schizophrenia, simple deteriorative disorder
(simple schizophrenia), minor depressive disorder, recurrent brief depressive disor-
der, mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, dissociative trance disorder, depressive per-
sonality disorder, and passive-aggressive personality disorder (negativistic personal-
ity disorder).

Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome

The Psychotic Disorders Work Group proposed the new diagnosis attenuated psy-
chosis syndrome. The rationale is to identify persons at risk for schizophrenia in order
to facilitate early identification and treatment to improve outcomes. The syndrome
consists of mild psychotic-like symptoms and clinically relevant distress and impair-
ment. Conversion to schizophrenia or some other full-blown psychosis is a possible
outcome and occurs in a significant minority of individuals. Because the syndrome is
most often seen as a comorbid disorder, it is not clear whether it represents a distinct
disorder or rather a trait or state vulnerability for increased risk of development of a
psychotic disorder. Another concern is that it appears to overlap with schizotypal per-
sonality disorder, and it is not clear how the conditions relate.
The proposed diagnosis became a focus of controversy during the development
of DSM-5. Critics within and outside the field expressed concern that the diagnosis


**_Conditions for Further Study_** **471**

would result in psychiatric labeling of persons who are not ill and who in most cases
would never develop a psychotic disorder, and would lead to unnecessary and costly
interventions. This could include the increased use of off-label antipsychotics, putting
patients at risk for iatrogenic complications (e.g., weight gain, metabolic disorders,
movement disorders).

Proposed Criteria for Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome

A. At least one of the following symptoms is present in attenuated form, with relatively
intact reality testing, and is of sufficient severity or frequency to warrant clinical at-
tention:

1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
3. Disorganized speech.

B. Symptom(s) must have been present at least once per week for the past month.
C. Symptom(s) must have begun or worsened in the past year.
D. Symptom(s) is sufficiently distressing and disabling to the individual to warrant
clinical attention.
E. Symptom(s) is not better explained by another mental disorder, including a de-
pressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, and is not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.
F. Criteria for any psychotic disorder have never been met.

Depressive Episodes With

Short-Duration Hypomania

Individuals with short-duration hypomania have experienced at least one major de-
pressive episode as well as at least two episodes of 2–3 days’ duration in which crite-
ria for a hypomanic episode were met except for symptom duration. The symptoms
represent a noticeable change in the individual’s normal behavior.
The Mood Disorders Work Group proposed the diagnosis to recognize that people
who have experienced short-duration hypomania and a major depressive episode,
with their increased comorbidity with substance use disorders and greater history of
bipolar disorder, more closely resembles individuals with bipolar disorder that those
with major depressive disorder. It is estimated that 2.8% of the general population ex-
perience short-duration hypomania, and the prevalence seems greater in women.
While the proposed criteria would fill a diagnostic gap for those with short-dura-
tion hypomania, the diagnosis could lead to confusion with bipolar II disorder, major
depressive disorder with mixed features, or cyclothymic disorder. The condition could
also be confused with borderline personality disorder, in which affective instability is
a common symptom.


**472** DSM-5 Guidebook

Proposed Criteria for Depressive Episodes With
Short-Duration Hypomania

**Lifetime experience of at least one major depressive episode meeting the fol-
lowing criteria:**
A. Five (or more) of the following criteria have been present during the same 2-week
period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symp-
toms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. ( **Note:** Do not
include symptoms that are clearly attributable to a medical condition.)

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either sub-
    jective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by oth-
    ers (e.g., appears tearful). ( **Note:** In children and adolescents, can be irritable
    mood.)
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of
the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or obser-
vation).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more
than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly
every day. ( **Note:** In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others,
not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be
delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being
sick).
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day
(either by subjective account or as observed by others).
9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation
    without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing
    suicide.

B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or
another medical condition.
D. The disturbance is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder and is not su-
perimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder,
or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic dis-
order.

**At least two lifetime episodes of hypomanic periods that involve the required
criterion symptoms below but are of insufficient duration (at least 2 days but less
than 4 consecutive days) to meet criteria for a hypomanic episode. The criterion
symptoms are as follows:**
A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable
mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy.


**_Conditions for Further Study_** **473**

B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or
more) of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable), rep-
resent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a signifi-
cant degree:

1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressured to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant exter-
    nal stimuli), as reported or observed.
6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)
    or psychomotor agitation.
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse-
    quences (e.g., the individual engages in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual in-
    discretions, or foolish business investments).

C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is un-
characteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.
D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.
E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occu-
pational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic fea-
tures, the episode is, by definition, manic.
F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).

Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder

The Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum, Posttraumatic, and Dissociative Dis-
orders Work Group proposed persistent complex bereavement disorder as a new di-
agnosis on the basis of research showing that people who experience “prolonged” or
“complicated” grief after loss of a close family member or friend have significant dis-
tress or functional impairment compared with persons who experience normal grief
reactions. The work group believes that such conditions are not adequately covered
in DSM.

Proposed Criteria for Persistent Complex
Bereavement Disorder

A. The individual experienced the death of someone with whom he or she had a close
relationship.
B. Since the death, at least one of the following symptoms is experienced on more
days than not and to a clinically significant degree and has persisted for at least
12 months after the death in the case of bereaved adults and 6 months for bereaved
children:


**474** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. Persistent yearning/longing for the deceased. In young children, yearning may
    be expressed in play and behavior, including behaviors that reflect being sep-
    arated from, and also reuniting with, a caregiver or other attachment figure.
2. Intense sorrow and emotional pain in response to the death.
3. Preoccupation with the deceased.
4. Preoccupation with the circumstances of the death. In children, this preoccu-
    pation with the deceased may be expressed through the themes of play and
    behavior and may extend to preoccupation with possible death of others close
    to them.

C. Since the death, at least six of the following symptoms are experienced on more
days than not and to a clinically significant degree, and have persisted for at least
12 months after the death in the case of bereaved adults and 6 months for be-
reaved children:
**Reactive distress to the death**

1. Marked difficulty accepting the death. In children, this is dependent on the
    child’s capacity to comprehend the meaning and permanence of death.
2. Experiencing disbelief or emotional numbness over the loss.
3. Difficulty with positive reminiscing about the deceased.
4. Bitterness or anger related to the loss.
5. Maladaptive appraisals about oneself in relation to the deceased or the death
    (e.g., self-blame).
6. Excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss (e.g., avoidance of individuals,
    places, or situations associated with the deceased; in children, this may include
    avoidance of thoughts and feelings regarding the deceased).
**Social/identity disruption**
7. A desire to die in order to be with the deceased.
8. Difficulty trusting other individuals since the death.
9. Feeling alone or detached from other individuals since the death.
10. Feeling that life is meaningless or empty without the deceased, or the belief that
one cannot function without the deceased.
11. Confusion about one’s role in life, or a diminished sense of one’s identity (e.g.,
feeling that a part of oneself died with the deceased).
12. Difficulty or reluctance to pursue interests since the loss or to plan for the future
(e.g., friendships, activities).

D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
E. The bereavement reaction is out of proportion to or inconsistent with cultural, reli-
gious, or age-appropriate norms.

Specify if:
**With traumatic bereavement:** Bereavement due to homicide or suicide with per-
sistent distressing preoccupations regarding the traumatic nature of the death (of-
ten in response to loss reminders), including the deceased’s last moments, degree
of suffering and mutilating injury, or the malicious or intentional nature of the death.


**_Conditions for Further Study_** **475**

Caffeine Use Disorder

The Substance-Related Disorders Work Group proposed inclusion of caffeine use dis-
order. Data show that a substantial proportion of chronic caffeine users develop fea-
tures of substance dependence: continued use despite physical or psychological
harm, unsuccessful efforts to cut down or quit, and continued use to avoid withdrawal
symptoms. Establishing a caffeine use disorder diagnosis would increase recognition
of the syndrome among health care providers and the general population. Recogni-
tion could lead to the development of specific cessation strategies and interventions
that could benefit a large number of individuals. On the other hand, critics suggest
that recognizing this disorder might trivialize substance use disorders in general be-
cause its prevalence would potentially include a large proportion of the adult general
population.

Proposed Criteria for Caffeine Use Disorder

A problematic pattern of caffeine use leading to clinically significant impairment or dis-
tress, as manifested by at least the first three of the following criteria occurring within a
12-month period:

1. A persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control caffeine use.
2. Continued caffeine use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
    physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacer-
    bated by caffeine.
3. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:

```
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for caffeine.
b. Caffeine (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal
symptoms.
```
4. Caffeine is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was in-
    tended.
5. Recurrent caffeine use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,
    school, or home (e.g., repeated tardiness or absences from work or school related
    to caffeine use or withdrawal).
6. Continued caffeine use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-
    sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of caffeine (e.g., arguments
    with spouse about consequences of use, medical problems, cost).
7. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:

```
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of caffeine to achieve desired effect.
b. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of caffeine.
```
8. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain caffeine, use caffeine,
    or recover from its effects.
9. Craving or a strong desire or urge to use caffeine.

Internet Gaming Disorder

Criteria were proposed by the Substance-Related Disorders Work Group to recognize a
new and rapidly expanding condition made possible by modern technology. Internet
gaming disorder consists of excessive and/or inappropriate use of the Internet to engage
in games, often with other players. Although this condition is relatively common, with
many reports from Asian countries, work group members argued that it is not adequately
represented DSM. Internet gaming disorder is possible only in societies where computers
are available and the Internet is accessible. For this reason, it shows the clear influence of
cultural and technological change on socially sanctioned behavior taken to its extreme.
Despite its newness, the disorder captures the same common clinical features that link it
to the substance addictions: repetitive and driven behaviors despite negative conse-
quences, diminished control over the behaviors, cravings for the behavior, and experienc-
ing a pleasurable response while engaged in the behavior. Symptoms of tolerance and
withdrawal, similar to those seen with substance use disorders, have also been reported.
Discussion regarding including this syndrome during the development of DSM-5
sparked debate among professionals and the lay public. Some believe that its inclu-
sion would medicalize bad behavior and potentially lead to including other so-called
behavioral addictions in future editions of DSM (e.g., compulsive shopping, overeat-
ing, hypersexual behavior). Others suggest that the concept is overly narrow, and a
broader category of “Internet addiction” or “compulsive computer use” should have
been proposed.

Proposed Criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder

Persistent and recurrent use of the Internet to engage in games, often with other play-
ers, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as indicated by five (or
more) of the following in a 12-month period:

1. Preoccupation with Internet games. (The individual thinks about previous gaming
    activity or anticipates playing the next game; Internet gaming becomes the domi-
    nant activity in daily life).
    **Note:** This disorder is distinct from Internet gambling, which is included under
    gambling disorder.
2. Withdrawal symptoms when Internet gaming is taken away. (These symptoms are
    typically described as irritability, anxiety, or sadness, but there are no physical
    signs of pharmacological withdrawal.)
3. Tolerance—the need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in Internet
    games.
4. Unsuccessful attempts to control the participation in Internet games.
5. Loss of interests in previous hobbies and entertainment as a result of, and with the
    exception of, Internet games.
6. Continued excessive use of Internet games despite knowledge of psychosocial prob-
    lems.
7. Has deceived family members, therapists, or others regarding the amount of Inter-
    net gaming.


**_Conditions for Further Study_** **477**

8. Use of Internet games to escape or relieve a negative mood (e.g., feelings of help-
    lessness, guilt, anxiety).
9. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career op-
    portunity because of participation in Internet games.

**Note:** Only nongambling Internet games are included in this disorder. Use of the In-
ternet for required activities in a business or profession is not included; nor is the dis-
order intended to include other recreational or social Internet use. Similarly, sexual
Internet sites are excluded.

Specify current severity:
Internet gaming disorder can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on the degree
of disruption of normal activities. Individuals with less severe Internet gaming disorder
may exhibit fewer symptoms and less disruption of their lives. Those with severe Inter-
net gaming disorder will have more hours spent on the computer and more severe loss
of relationships or career or school opportunities.

Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated With

Prenatal Alcohol Exposure

The Substance-Related Disorders Work Group proposed criteria for neurobehavioral
disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure to encompass a full range of de-
velopmental disabilities associated with in utero exposure to alcohol. The proposed
condition is a behavioral and psychological syndrome that creates clinically signifi-
cant distress and impairment.
The rationale for including this condition is to boost the recognition of persons nega-
tively impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure and to facilitate treatment referral. These in-
dividuals are overrepresented, although generally unrecognized, in the child welfare
system, juvenile detention and correctional facilities, and both outpatient and inpatient
psychiatric settings. Including this condition in DSM could boost recognition and referral
for appropriate care by mental health, educational, and criminal justice systems. On the
downside, some would argue that its symptoms are adequately captured in DSM and
that clinicians simply need to be alert to the symptoms. Another concern is that the diag-
nosis presumes a causal association with alcohol, which is difficult to prove. The symp-
toms are wide ranging and overlap with those of many disorders—including conduct
disorder and antisocial personality disorder—that are not specifically excluded.

Proposed Criteria for Neurobehavioral Disorder
Associated With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure

A. More than minimal exposure to alcohol during gestation, including prior to preg-
nancy recognition. Confirmation of gestational exposure to alcohol may be ob-
tained from maternal self-report of alcohol use in pregnancy, medical or other
records, or clinical observation.
B. Impaired neurocognitive functioning as manifested by one or more of the following:


**478** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. Impairment in global intellectual performance (i.e., IQ of 70 or below, or a stan-
    dard score of 70 or below on a comprehensive developmental assessment).
2. Impairment in executive functioning (e.g., poor planning and organization; in-
    flexibility; difficulty with behavioral inhibition).
3. Impairment in learning (e.g., lower academic achievement than expected for in-
    tellectual level; specific learning disability).
4. Memory impairment (e.g., problems remembering information learned re-
    cently; repeatedly making the same mistakes; difficulty remembering lengthy
    verbal instructions).
5. Impairment in visual-spatial reasoning (e.g., disorganized or poorly planned
    drawings or constructions; problems differentiating left from right).

C. Impaired self-regulation as manifested by one or more of the following:

1. Impairment in mood or behavioral regulation (e.g., mood lability; negative affect
    or irritability; frequent behavioral outbursts).
2. Attention deficit (e.g., difficulty shifting attention; difficulty sustaining mental effort).
3. Impairment in impulse control (e.g., difficulty waiting turn; difficulty complying
    with rules).

D. Impairment in adaptive functioning as manifested by two or more of the following,
one of which must be (1) or (2):

1. Communication deficit (e.g., delayed acquisition of language; difficulty under-
    standing spoken language).
2. Impairment in social communication and interaction (e.g., overly friendly with
    strangers; difficulty reading social cues; difficulty understanding social conse-
    quences).
3. Impairment in daily living skills (e.g., delayed toileting, feeding, or bathing; dif-
    ficulty managing daily schedule).
4. Impairment in motor skills (e.g., poor fine motor development; delayed attain-
    ment of gross motor milestones or ongoing deficits in gross motor function; def-
    icits in coordination and balance).

E. Onset of the disorder (symptoms in Criteria B, C, and D) occurs in childhood.
F. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, aca-
demic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
G. The disorder is not better explained by the direct physiological effects associated
with postnatal use of a substance (e.g., a medication, alcohol or other drugs), a
general medical condition (e.g., traumatic brain injury, delirium, dementia), another
known teratogen (e.g., fetal hydantoin syndrome), a genetic condition (e.g., Wil-
liams syndrome, Down syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome), or environmental
neglect.

Suicidal Behavior Disorder

The rationale supporting the inclusion of suicidal behavior disorder, offered by the
Mood Disorders Work Group, has mainly to do with coding. Although suicidal be-
havior causes significant morbidity and leads to high utilization of mental health re-
sources, DSM codes reflecting suicidal behavior are limited to E (external cause of


**_Conditions for Further Study_** **479**

injury) codes drawn from ICD-9-CM (E950–E959) that differentiate between acciden-
tal and self-inflicted injury. The codes are often assigned by administrative personnel
and are frequently ignored. Although suicidal behavior and ideation are listed as
symptoms of major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, these
symptoms are not codable and misrepresent the independent associations that these
behaviors have with many other psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, research sug-
gests that suicidal behaviors share similar pathological features, regardless of comor-
bidity. Thus, the absence of an approved code leads to incomplete and misleading
information in clinical records, and the availability of a codable condition might help
with prevention and safety monitoring efforts.

Proposed Criteria for Suicidal Behavior Disorder

A. Within the last 24 months, the individual has made a suicide attempt.
**Note:** A suicide attempt is a self-initiated sequence of behaviors by an individual
who, at the time of initiation, expected that the set of actions would lead to his or
her own death. (The “time of initiation” is the time when a behavior took place that
involved applying the method.)
B. The act does not meet criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury—that is, it does not in-
volve self-injury directed to the surface of the body undertaken to induce relief from
a negative feeling/cognitive state or to achieve a positive mood state.
C. The diagnosis is not applied to suicidal ideation or to preparatory acts.
D. The act was not initiated during a state of delirium or confusion.
E. The act was not undertaken solely for a political or religious objective.

Specify if:
**Current:** Not more than 12 months since the last attempt.
**In early remission:** 12–24 months since the last attempt.

Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

The Childhood and Adolescent Disorders Work Group proposed nonsuicidal self-in-
jury with the rationale that these symptoms are poorly represented in DSM. The clos-
est approximation is Item 5 in the criteria set for DSM-IV borderline personality
disorder: “recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating be-
havior.” Research shows that repeated self-injury co-occurs in both adolescents and
adults with a variety of diagnoses, and many of these individuals do not meet criteria
for borderline personality disorder. The criteria correct the following misinformation
regarding self-injury: 1) that it is pathognomonic of borderline personality disorder,
and 2) that it is a form of attempted suicide. Neither statement is true, yet both have
the potential to lead to overly restrictive or inappropriate clinical management (e.g.,
inpatient hospitalization, lengthy and complex psychotherapies). These criteria help
distinguish nonsuicidal self-injury and attempted suicide. For most individuals, the
former is not designed to result in death but rather to bring relief from tension and


**480** DSM-5 Guidebook

other negative affects. These behaviors (e.g., cutting, burning) tend to have low lethal-
ity. The proposed definition requires that injuries be superficial and frequently re-
peated. Most individuals who engage in these behaviors are aware of their non-life-
threatening nature. Nevertheless, recurrent self-injurious behaviors are associated
with an elevated risk for attempted and completed suicide.
One concern about the criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury is that borderline per-
sonality disorder is not specifically excluded. Although self-harm is not specific for the
diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, the two are tightly linked, so the exclu-
sion should be clear.

Proposed Criteria for Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

A. In the last year, the individual has, on 5 or more days, engaged in intentional self-
inflicted damage to the surface of his or her body of a sort likely to induce bleeding,
bruising, or pain (e.g., cutting, burning, stabbing, hitting, excessive rubbing), with the
expectation that the injury will lead to only minor or moderate physical harm (i.e., there
is no suicidal intent).
**Note:** The absence of suicidal intent has either been stated by the individual or can
be inferred by the individual’s repeated engagement in a behavior that the individ-
ual knows, or has learned, is not likely to result in death.
B. The individual engages in the self-injurious behavior with one or more of the fol-
lowing expectations:

1. To obtain relief from a negative feeling or cognitive state.
2. To resolve an interpersonal difficulty.
3. To induce a positive feeling state.
**Note:** The desired relief or response is experienced during or shortly after the self-
injury, and the individual may display patterns of behavior suggesting a depen-
dence on repeatedly engaging in it.
C. The intentional self-injury is associated with at least one of the following:
1. Interpersonal difficulties or negative feelings or thoughts, such as depression,
anxiety, tension, anger, generalized distress, or self-criticism, occurring in the
period immediately prior to the self-injurious act.
2. Prior to engaging in the act, a period of preoccupation with the intended behav-
ior that is difficult to control.
3. Thinking about self-injury that occurs frequently, even when it is not acted
upon.

D. The behavior is not socially sanctioned (e.g., body piercing, tattooing, part of a re-
ligious or cultural ritual) and is not restricted to picking a scab or nail biting.
E. The behavior or its consequences cause clinically significant distress or interfer-
ence in interpersonal, academic, or other important areas of functioning.
F. The behavior does not occur exclusively during psychotic episodes, delirium, sub-
stance intoxication, or substance withdrawal. In individuals with a neurodevelop-
mental disorder, the behavior is not part of a pattern of repetitive stereotypies. The
behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder or medical condition

(e.g., psychotic disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, Lesch-
Nyhan syndrome, stereotypic movement disorder with self-injury, trichotillomania
[hair-pulling disorder], excoriation [skin-picking] disorder).

KEY POINTS

- This chapter includes proposed disorders that may be included in future edi-
    tions of DSM. Their inclusion in DSM-5 provides an opportunity for establishing
    standardized criteria to facilitate research.
- To achieve full disorder status, the condition should be “unrepresented” (or not
    well represented in DSM); have clinical value; have the potential to improve ac-
    curate identification and/or treatment; and be prevalent, impairing, and distinctive.
- DSM-5 includes eight criteria sets in Section III in the chapter “Conditions for
    Further Study.” For each condition, it was concluded that insufficient data are
    currently available to warrant inclusion as an official DSM diagnosis. The con-
    ditions include attenuated psychosis syndrome, which became a lightning rod
    in the DSM-5 deliberations; depressive episodes with short-duration hypoma-
    nia; persistent complex bereavement disorder; caffeine use disorder; Internet
    gaming disorder; neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol ex-
    posure; suicidal behavior disorder; and nonsuicidal self-injury.
