## Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric con-

ditions worldwide. Research consistently shows them to be associated with increased
psychiatric and physical morbidity, use of health care services, and psychosocial im-
pairment. Necessity dictates that clinicians recognize and treat anxiety disorders
without delay. Table 6–1 lists the DSM-5 anxiety disorders.
The word _anxiety_ has been used to describe diverse phenomena, but in the clinical
literature the term refers to the presence of fear or apprehension that is out of propor-
tion to the situation. Anxiety was considered to play an important role in several con-
ditions identified in the nineteenth century (Goodwin and Guze 1989). In the late
nineteenth century, Da Costa wrote about an “irritable heart syndrome,” character-
ized by chest pain, palpitations, and dizziness, a disorder thought to be due to a func-
tional cardiac disturbance. He described the syndrome as occurring in a Civil War
veteran, and later the syndrome was variously referred to as “soldier ’s heart,” the “effort
syndrome,” or “neurocirculatory asthenia.” At about the same time, Beard described
_neurasthenia,_ thought to be a disorder of nervous exhaustion. Freud later separated
neurasthenia from cases affected mainly with anxiety symptoms under the name _anx-_

_iety neurosis._ He described its clinical characteristics as including general irritability,
anxious expectation, pangs of conscience, anxiety attacks, and phobias.
In DSM-I, the category psychoneurotic disorders constituted a distinct class in
which anxiety was the chief characteristic. According to DSM-I, the anxiety “may be
directly felt and expressed or... may be unconsciously and automatically controlled
by the utilization of various psychological defense mechanisms” (p. 31). Several “reac-
tions” were enumerated, including “anxiety reaction” and “phobic reaction”—disorders
that continue to be recognized as anxiety disorders—and others that now fall into sepa-
rate categories (i.e., dissociative reaction, obsessive compulsive reaction). In DSM-II,
the category was renamed “neuroses” and the term _reaction_ was eliminated, but the
category was otherwise mostly unchanged.
DSM-III’s all-encompassing changes led to a regrouping of some disorders and
the creation of new disorders in which anxiety was either experienced as the predom-
inant disturbance or experienced by the person as he or she attempted to master its
symptoms (e.g., confronting a dreaded object or situation). The new diagnostic class,
anxiety disorders, included panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, simple pho-
bia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic
stress disorder (which was hyphenated until DSM-IV). Acute stress disorder was later
added in DSM-IV. DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and DSM-IV-TR otherwise remained true to DSM-
III, except for minor changes in the criteria sets and some name changes (e.g., from
simple phobia to specific phobia).
In DSM-5, the anxiety disorders chapter has remained largely faithful to its immedi-
ate predecessor, with several major exceptions. Obsessive-compulsive disorder now has
its own chapter (see Chapter 7, “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders”). Post-
traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder have been moved to “Trauma- and
Stressor-Related Disorders” (see Chapter 8). These changes were made in response to sci-
entific data showing that these disorders stand apart from the other anxiety disorders.
The sequential order of the chapters in DSM-5 (i.e., the metastructure), however, reflects
the close relationship among the disorders. Last, separation anxiety disorder and selec-


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **125**

tive mutism are new to the chapter, having been formerly included in the DSM-IV chap-
ter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.”
Other changes include the wording of criteria sets, which have been modified to
1) reflect the dysfunction underlying these disorders as intense, frequent, and chronic
fear and anxiety; 2) separate the main constructs (e.g., situational triggers, cognitive ide-
ation, intensity, frequency, duration); and 3) enhance consistency across the disorders.
For specific phobia and social anxiety disorder, changes include deletion of the require-
ment that adults recognize that their anxiety is excessive or unreasonable. In addition,
the minimum 6-month duration, which had been limited to individuals under age 18
years in DSM-IV, has been extended to all ages. The essential features of panic attacks
remain unchanged, but the terminology for describing different types has been re-
placed with the terms _expected_ or _unexpected._ Panic disorder and agoraphobia have been
unlinked, and the criteria for agoraphobia have been extended to be consistent with cri-
teria sets for the other disorders. With social anxiety disorder, the “generalized” speci-
fier had been deleted and replaced with a “performance only” specifier.

Separation Anxiety Disorder

Separation anxiety disorder is a condition in which a person has excessive anxiety re-
garding separation from places or people to whom he or she has a strong emotional
attachment. Included with the childhood disorders in DSM-III through DSM-IV-TR,
separation anxiety disorder has now been moved because of research that links it to
the anxiety disorders and the growing recognition that it occurs in adults. In fact, the
lifetime estimate of separation anxiety disorder in childhood is 4.1%, whereas the rate
among adults is 6.6%. Although about one-third of adults with separation anxiety
disorder had it in childhood, the majority of adults had a first onset in adulthood. In
children, the strong emotional attachment is likely to a parent; with adults, the attach-
ment might be to a spouse or a friend.
Separation anxiety disorder should not be confused with separation anxiety that
occurs as a normal stage of development for healthy, secure babies. Separation anxi-
ety typically starts at around 8 months of age and increases until 13–15 months, when
it begins to decline.

Diagnostic Criteria for Separation Anxiety Disorder **309.21 (F93.0)**

A. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation
from those to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by at least three of the
following:

1. Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing separation
    from home or from major attachment figures.
2. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures or about
    possible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or death.
3. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event (e.g.,
    getting lost, being kidnapped, having an accident, becoming ill) that causes
    separation from a major attachment figure.


**126** DSM-5 Guidebook

4. Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to school, to work,
    or elsewhere because of fear of separation.
5. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without ma-
    jor attachment figures at home or in other settings.
6. Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to sleep with-
    out being near a major attachment figure.
7. Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.
8. Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches,
    nausea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is
    anticipated.

B. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and
adolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults.
C. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, aca-
demic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refus-
ing to leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum
disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders;
refusal to go outside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill
health or other harm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or
concerns about having an illness in illness anxiety disorder.

Criterion A

Although some separation anxiety is normal at various developmental phases, when
the fear or anxiety is excessive and functionally impairing, this diagnosis may be ap-
propriate. To increase the relevance to adults with separation anxiety disorder, terms
have been added (e.g., addition of “work” in Criterion A4) or deleted (e.g., removal
of “adults” in DSM-IV’s Criterion A5 because attachment figures are not always
adults; for adults, attachment figures can be partners, children, and so forth).

Criterion B

The duration is specified as typically lasting at least 6 months in adults (instead of the
4-week requirement in DSM-IV that has been retained in DSM-5 for children and ad-
olescents) to minimize overdiagnosis of transient fears. A caveat permits shorter du-
rations in cases of acute onset or exacerbation of severe symptoms.

Criteria C and D

Separation anxiety disorder is associated with significant impairment. People with
the disorder may refuse to attend school or work, complain of somatic problems, and
become socially isolated. Untreated, the disorder is associated with low educational
attainment, unemployment, and either remaining unmarried or experiencing marital
disruption. Because separation anxiety may occur in association with other mental
disorders, the clinician needs to determine whether the person’s symptoms meet full
criteria for an independent diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder.


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **127**

Selective Mutism

Selective mutism is characterized by the consistent failure to speak in specific social
situations where speaking is expected despite being able to speak in other situations
(e.g., at home). Originally named “elective mutism” in DSM-III, and renamed “selec-
tive mutism” for DSM-IV, the disorder was included with DSM-IV’s “Disorders Usu-
ally First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.” Selective mutism has been
moved because of research that connects it with the anxiety disorders, and growing
recognition that it continues into adulthood (or in rare cases begins in adulthood). Se-
lective mutism is rare and most likely to manifest in young children.

Diagnostic Criteria for Selective Mutism **313.23 (F94.0)**

A. Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which there is an expec-
tation for speaking (e.g., at school) despite speaking in other situations.
B. The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with
social communication.
C. The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of
school).
D. The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with,
the spoken language required in the social situation.
E. The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder (e.g., child-
hood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively during the course of
autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder.

Criterion A

When encountering individuals in specific social interactions, children and adults
with selective mutism do not initiate speech or reciprocally respond when spoken to
by others. These same individuals when seen at home, however, can interact nor-
mally. The diagnosis requires a _consistent_ failure to speak in social situations.

Criterion B

Selective mutism is associated with significant impairment. Children with selective
mutism often refuse to speak at school, leading to academic or educational impair-
ment. As these children mature, they may face increasing social isolation, and in
school settings, they suffer academic impairment because often they do not commu-
nicate appropriately with teachers regarding academic or personal needs.

Criterion C

Selective silence lasting less than a month (e.g., a child’s being upset and refusing to
talk for a few days) would not meet criteria for the diagnosis.


**128** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion D

Children in families who have immigrated to a country where a different language is
spoken may refuse to speak the new language because of lack of knowledge of the
language. If comprehension of the new language is adequate but refusal to speak per-
sists, a diagnosis of selective mutism would be warranted.

Criterion E

Although children with selective mutism generally have normal language skills, there
may occasionally be an associated communication disorder. Selective mutism should be
distinguished from speech disturbances that are better explained by a communication
disorder, such as language disorder, speech sound disorder (previously phonological
disorder), childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), or pragmatic (social) communi-
cation disorder. Unlike selective mutism, the speech disturbance in these conditions is
not restricted to a specific social situation. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder,
schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, or severe intellectual disability may have
problems with social communication and be unable to speak appropriately in social sit-
uations. In contrast, selective mutism should be diagnosed only when a child has an es-
tablished capacity to speak in some social situations (typically at home).

Specific Phobia

The term _phobia_ refers to an excessive fear of a specific object, circumstance, or situa-
tion. Phobias are classified on the basis of the feared object or situation. Both specific
phobia and social anxiety disorder (social phobia) require the development of intense
anxiety, upon exposure to the feared object or situation. Both diagnoses also require
that the fear or anxiety either interferes with functioning or causes marked distress.
Specific phobia includes the following specifiers: animal, natural environment,
blood-injection-injury, situational, and other (for phobias that do not clearly fall into
the previous four categories). The key feature for each stimulus type is that the fear
or anxiety is limited to a specific object, both temporally and with respect to other ob-
jects. An individual with specific phobia becomes immediately frightened or anxious
when presented with a feared object. This fear may relate to concern about harm from
a feared object, concern about embarrassment, or fear of consequences related to expo-
sure to the feared object. For example, individuals with blood-injection-injury phobia
may be afraid of fainting on exposure to blood, and individuals with fear of heights may
be afraid of becoming dizzy.
Specific phobia may involve fear of more than one object, particularly within a
specific subcategory of phobia. For example, an individual with a phobia of insects
may also have a phobia of mice, both phobias being classified as animal-type phobias.
Quantifying the impairment associated with a specific phobia is sometimes difficult,
because a comorbid disorder typically tends to cause more impairment than a specific
phobia. Impairment associated with specific phobia typically restricts the social or
professional activities of the individual.
Phobias have been recognized as incapacitating for more than 100 years. The
prominent place of phobias in the history of modern mental health is indicated by the


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **129**

major role that case histories of patients with phobias played in the development of
both psychoanalytic and cognitive therapies. The phobia category has undergone
progressive refinement over the years. In DSM-III, phobias were regarded as a group
of related but distinct conditions. Between DSM-III and DSM-IV, specific phobia was
modified to include subcategories, based on research noting distinct physiology and
demographics of the stimulus types.
Specific phobias are usually quite easily distinguished from other conditions be-
cause of the focused nature of the anxiety, both over time and with respect to objects
or situations. The most difficult diagnostic issues involve differentiating specific pho-
bia from other anxiety disorders.
Specific phobia exhibits a bimodal age at onset, with a childhood peak for animal
phobia, natural environment phobia, and blood-injection-injury phobia and an early
adulthood peak for other phobias, such as situational phobia. Because individuals
with isolated specific phobias rarely present for treatment, research on the course of
the disorder in the clinic is limited. Data suggest that most specific phobias that begin
in childhood and persist into adulthood will continue to persist over many years. The
severity of the condition when it persists into adulthood is thought to remain rela-
tively constant, without the waxing and waning course of the disorder during child-
hood and adolescence or seen with other anxiety disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Specific Phobia

A. Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, an-
imals, receiving an injection, seeing blood).
**Note:** In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freez-
ing, or clinging.

B. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety.
C. The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or
anxiety.
D. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific
object or situation and to the sociocultural context.
E. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.
F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
G. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disor-
der, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like
symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia); objects or situa-
tions related to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of
traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or at-
tachment figures (as in separation anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in so-
cial anxiety disorder).

Code based on the phobic stimulus:
**300.29 (F40.218) Animal** (e.g., spiders, insects, dogs).
**300.29 (F40.228) Natural environment** (e.g., heights, storms, water).


**130** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
300.29 (F40.23x) Blood-injection-injury (e.g., needles, invasive medical proce-
dures).
Coding note: Select specific ICD-10-CM code as follows: F40.230 fear of
blood; F40.231 fear of injections and transfusions; F40.232 fear of other medi-
cal care; or F40.233 fear of injury.
300.29 (F40.248) Situational (e.g., airplanes, elevators, enclosed places).
300.29 (F40.298) Other (e.g., situations that may lead to choking or vomiting; in chil-
dren, e.g., loud sounds or costumed characters).
```
**Coding note:** When more than one phobic stimulus is present, code all ICD-10-CM
codes that apply (e.g., for fear of snakes and flying, F40.218 specific phobia, animal,
and F40.248 specific phobia, situational).

Criteria A and B

There is marked fear or anxiety that is triggered by exposure to a specific stimulus.
The term _marked_ has been operationalized as “intense.” The phrase “fear or anxiety”
is used consistently across anxiety disorders. The phobic object or situation almost al-
ways provokes immediate fear or anxiety.

Criterion C

There are generally two responses to the fear or anxiety elicited by the stimulus. A per-
son may avoid situations in which he or she is exposed to the stimulus, or the person
may expose himself or herself to the phobic object or situation and endure the fear or
anxiety. DSM-5 has added the descriptor “actively avoided” to minimize overdiagno-
sis of mild fears.

Criterion D

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion, or more intense than is deemed necessary,
given the actual danger that the object or situation poses—that is, the fear or anxiety
is greater than is deemed appropriate to the actual danger in the situation. Although
people with specific phobia often recognize their reactions as disproportionate to the
situation, they tend to overestimate the danger in their feared situations, and thus the
judgment of being out of proportion should not be made solely on the basis of self-
report. In DSM-IV, Criterion C required that the individual be aware that the fear or
anxiety was excessive, but stated that this requirement might not be present in chil-
dren. Self-recognition has been removed because many adults deny that their fears
are out of proportion or excessive, and the notation that in children the feature many
be absent has been deleted. This criterion requires that the sociocultural context be
taken into account.

Criterion E

With the duration criterion “typically lasting for 6 months or more” (with text clarifi-
cation that the cutoff should not be applied too rigidly), the overdiagnosis of tran-
sient fears and phobias should be minimized. DSM-IV included a duration criterion


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **131**

(6 months or more) for children under age 18, but this is now extended to all age
groups given the evidence that transient fears and phobias occur in adulthood.

Criterion F

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance needs to result in clinically significant distress or func-
tional impairment. For example, a person who avoids the ferris wheel at a state fair
because of fear of heights may still have a lovely day at the fair and pay little heed to
how this fear affects the experience. Some people cope with their phobias by manip-
ulating their environments (e.g., avoidance of zoos by a person who fears snakes). In
these cases, the impairment would be minimal or nonexistent and the person’s pre-
sentation would not qualify for the diagnosis. If the manipulation of the environment
affects the person’s work, for example, then it may cause significant interference.

Criterion G

Many disorders are characterized by avoidance (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder,
agoraphobia). Specific phobia should be diagnosed only when avoidance is related to
an object or situation and is not accounted for by another disorder.

Specifiers

The specifiers reflect the general categories of phobic stimulus. DSM-5 has removed
reference to fears of contracting an illness in the “other” category because of the relat-
edness of such fears to obsessive-compulsive disorder and to hypochondriasis (which
has been replaced, in DSM-5, by somatic symptom disorder and, in a minority of cases,
illness anxiety disorder).

Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

Social anxiety disorder involves fear of or anxiety about social situations, including situ-
ations that involve scrutiny or contact with strangers. Individuals with this disorder typ-
ically fear embarrassing themselves in social situations, such as while speaking in public
or meeting new people. This disorder can involve specific fears or anxiety about per-
forming certain activities, such as writing, eating, or speaking in front of others. It can
also involve a vague, nonspecific fear of embarrassing oneself or feeling foolish. The cli-
nician should recognize that many individuals exhibit at least some social anxiety or self-
consciousness. Community studies suggest that roughly one-third of all people consider
themselves to be more anxious than other people in social situations. Such anxiety be-
comes a disorder only when the anxiety either prevents the person from participating in
desired activities or causes marked distress in such activities.

Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder
(Social Phobia) **300.23 (F40.10)**

A. Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual
is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions


**132** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
(e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eat-
ing or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech).
Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during inter-
actions with adults.
```
B. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that
will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to
rejection or offend others).
C. The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.

```
Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freez-
ing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations.
```
D. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.
E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation
and to the sociocultural context.
F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.
G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
H. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
I. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another
mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spec-
trum disorder.
J. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, obesity, disfigurement from
burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is ex-
cessive.
Specify if:
**Performance only:** If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.

Criteria A and B

These items cover the three contexts in which social anxiety disorder most commonly
occurs: social interactions, being observed by others, and performing in front of others.
In Criterion B, _humiliation_ and _embarrassment_ have been brought under the broader
phrase “negatively evaluated,” which is the core fear in social anxiety disorder. The
phrase “offend others” has been added to increase cultural sensitivity; in some cul-
tures the underlying fear is the concern that one will make others uncomfortable.

Criterion C

This criterion highlights that social anxiety is a conditioned, stimulus response. In ad-
dition, the criterion clarifies that in children, fear and anxiety may present in a range of
ways (e.g., tantrums).

Criterion D

Although some individuals with social anxiety disorder avoid the contexts that elicit
their anxiety, others endure the anxiety-provoking environments even when the anx-
iety or fear is intense.


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **133**

Criterion E

People with social anxiety disorder often have difficulty recognizing that their fear is
excessive. Therefore, the clinician may be in a better position to judge this. Use of the
phrase “out of proportion to the actual threat posed” is intended to operationalize what
was meant by “excessive or unreasonable” in DSM-IV. Criterion C in DSM-IV included
a note that self-recognition may be absent in children; this note has been deleted. Fi-
nally, the DSM-5 item reminds the clinician to take into account the “sociocultural con-
text.”

Criterion F

The DSM-IV requirement that the duration be 6 months or more in children under age
18 years has now been extended to all age groups, given the data that transient social
anxieties can occur in adulthood as well. This duration criterion helps to minimize
overdiagnosis of transient social anxiety.

Criteria G, H, I, and J

Most individuals experience some social anxiety at some point in their lives. Criterion
G requires that the symptoms cause considerable impairment or distress. This crite-
rion prevents the overdiagnosis of social anxiety disorder.
Many disorders are characterized by fear of social situations. Social anxiety disor-
der should be diagnosed only when the avoidance is not attributable to the effects of
a substance or medication, is not better explained by another mental disorder, and is
not related to another medical condition (Criteria H, I, and I).

Specifiers

Evidence suggests that the “performance only” specifier represents a subset of the
larger social anxiety disorder group with different pathophysiological correlates and
treatment response.

Panic Disorder

Panic disorder is characterized by a pattern of recurrent panic attacks accompanied by
persistent worry or behavioral change. Therefore, individuals with panic disorder ex-
perience anxiety symptoms and functional impairment independent of the actual attack.
The panic attacks occur spontaneously, arising without any trigger or environmental
cue. There has been considerable interest in the relationship between panic disorder
and agoraphobia. Although DSM-IV described panic disorder both with agoraphobia
and without agoraphobia, this distinction is not included in DSM-5 because it was not
meaningful. Panic disorder often co-occurs with a number of mental conditions beyond
agoraphobia, particularly anxiety and depressive disorders.
Panic disorder was included in DSM-III and was recognized as a distinct entity.
From DSM-III through DSM-IV-TR, panic disorder and agoraphobia were tightly
linked. As conceptualized in DSM-IV, agoraphobia invariably involves at least some


**134** DSM-5 Guidebook

form of spontaneous crescendo anxiety, even if such episodes do not meet formal cri-
teria for panic attacks. In the earlier versions of DSM and in ICD-10, agoraphobia is
considered less closely linked to panic disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Panic Disorder **300.01 (F41.0)**

A. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense
fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which
time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur:
**Note:** The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state.

1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.
    2. Sweating.
    3. Trembling or shaking.
    4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.
    5. Feelings of choking.
    6. Chest pain or discomfort.
    7. Nausea or abdominal distress.
    8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint.
    9. Chills or heat sensations.
10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).
11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from
oneself).
12. Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”
13. Fear of dying.
**Note:** Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncon-
trollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as
one of the four required symptoms.

B. At least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 month (or more) of one or both
of the following:

1. Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their conse-
    quences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, “going crazy”).
2. A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., be-
haviors designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance of exercise
or unfamiliar situations).

C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism,
cardiopulmonary disorders).
D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., the panic
attacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety
disorder; in response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific
phobia; in response to obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder; in re-
sponse to reminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or in
response to separation from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **135**

Criteria A and B

Panic disorder requires recurrent and “unexpected” panic attacks, at least one of which
is associated with either persistent concern or worry about additional attacks, or
changes in behavior related to the attacks. Examples are provided to help the clinician
understand the functional impact of the attacks.

Criteria C and D

Panic disorder must be differentiated from medical conditions that produce similar
symptoms. Panic attacks have been associated with a variety of endocrinological dis-
orders, including both hypo- and hyperthyroid states, hyperparathyroidism, and
pheochromocytomas. Episodic hypoglycemia can also produce panic symptoms. Sei-
zure disorders, vestibular dysfunction, neoplasms, prescribed and illicit substances,
and cardiac and pulmonary problems (e.g., arrhythmias, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, asthma) can all result in panic symptoms. Clues to an underlying medical
cause for panic symptoms include atypical features during panic attacks, such as ataxia,
alterations in consciousness, or bladder dyscontrol; onset of panic disorder relatively
late in life; or physical signs and symptoms indicating a medical condition.
Panic disorder also must be differentiated from a number of mental disorders,
particularly other anxiety states. Differentiation from generalized anxiety disorder
can sometimes be difficult, but classic panic attacks are characterized by rapid onset
and short duration, in contrast to the anxiety associated with generalized anxiety dis-
order, which emerges and dissipates more slowly. Anxiety also frequently accompa-
nies many other psychiatric disorders, including psychotic and mood disorders.

Panic Attack Specifier

A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear or discomfort lasting minutes to
hours that triggers uncomfortable physical sensations. Panic attacks usually begin
abruptly, peak within minutes, and can be frightening to the individual. When they
occur, the person may believe he or she is losing control, having a heart attack, or even
dying. Although many people have isolated panic attacks during stressful times,
these attacks do not occur repeatedly. Panic attacks may occur in various psycho-
pathological states.
Freud’s description of anxiety neurosis was defined by the coexistence of a state
of moderate and permanent anxiety and of anxiety attacks, whose manifestations
were similar to today’s panic attack. Anxiety neurosis was later subdivided into the
acute anxiety attack (i.e., a panic attack) and a state of moderate and continuous anx-
iety (now referred to as generalized anxiety disorder). This distinction was included
in the Research Diagnostic Criteria (Spitzer et al. 1975) and appeared a few years later
in DSM-III.
Importantly, as stated in DSM-5, panic attacks can be noted as a specifier for any
anxiety disorder as well as for other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders,
posttraumatic stress disorder) and some medical conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory,
vestibular, gastrointestinal). When the presence of a panic attack is identified, it


**136** DSM-5 Guidebook

should be documented with the specifier “with panic attacks” (e.g., posttraumatic
stress disorder with panic attacks).

Panic Attack Specifier

**Note:** Symptoms are presented for the purpose of identifying a panic attack; however,
panic attack is not a mental disorder and cannot be coded. Panic attacks can occur in
the context of any anxiety disorder as well as other mental disorders (e.g., depressive
disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders) and some medical
conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal). When the presence
of a panic attack is identified, it should be noted as a specifier (e.g., “posttraumatic
stress disorder with panic attacks”). For panic disorder, the presence of panic attack is
contained within the criteria for the disorder and panic attack is not used as a specifier.

An abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within min-
utes, and during which time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur:
**Note:** The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state.

1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.
2. Sweating.
3. Trembling or shaking.
4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.
5. Feelings of choking.
6. Chest pain or discomfort.
7. Nausea or abdominal distress.
8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint.
9. Chills or heat sensations.
10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).
11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from
oneself).
12. Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”
13. Fear of dying.

**Note:** Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrol-
lable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one of
the four required symptoms.

By itself, a panic attack is not a codable disorder. Episodes of abrupt fear occur in
many situations. A healthy person might experience a panic attack when confronted
with sudden extreme danger, and an individual with a phobia of heights might expe-
rience a panic attack when confronted with the feared situation. DSM-5 requires that
panic attacks be listed as a specifier to the specific disorder with which they occur. The
importance of the specifier is based on data demonstrating that panic attacks predict
the severity of other forms of psychopathology. A person who meets at least four of
the symptoms qualifies as having a panic attack. Data from the DSM-IV field trial
confirmed that the four-symptom threshold is optimal.
Although the DSM-5 symptoms are unchanged from DSM-IV, they are now rank-
ordered from most to least common. In addition, “heat sensations” replaces the DSM-IV


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **137**

symptom “hot flushes.” The concluding note is included to increase clinician aware-
ness of culture-based symptoms. For example, higher rates of paresthesias occur in
African Americans, trembling in Caribbean Latinos, and depersonalization/dereal-
ization in Puerto Ricans.

Agoraphobia

Agoraphobia was first identified by Westphal in the late 19th century when he de-
scribed people who feared public places (Goodwin and Guze 1989). DSM-III intro-
duced and codified agoraphobia as a distinctive syndrome characterized by “marked
fear and avoidance of being alone or in public places from which escape might be dif-
ficult or help not available in case of sudden incapacitations” (p. 226). In DSM-III-R,
agoraphobia was specifically defined as a classically conditioned response to panic
attacks. Although agoraphobia could be diagnosed in the absence of a history of
panic attacks, such an occurrence was thought to be rare. Therefore, agoraphobia be-
came conceptually linked to panic attacks, but was also seen explicitly and exclu-
sively as a secondary complication. In DSM-IV, agoraphobia could be diagnosed only
within the context of panic disorder or as the result of panic attacks or panic-like
symptoms (i.e., agoraphobia was related to fear of developing panic symptoms such
as dizziness or diarrhea). In community samples, however, the majority of people
with agoraphobia never experienced panic attacks or panic-like symptoms or psycho-
physiological symptoms of other types that clearly preceded the onset of agoraphobic
avoidance. In DSM-5, agoraphobia is a codable disorder independent of panic disor-
der or panic attacks (Wittchen et al. 2010).

Diagnostic Criteria for Agoraphobia **300.22 (F40.00)**

A. Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the following five situations:

1. Using public transportation (e.g., automobiles, buses, trains, ships, planes).
2. Being in open spaces (e.g., parking lots, marketplaces, bridges).
3. Being in enclosed places (e.g., shops, theaters, cinemas).
4. Standing in line or being in a crowd.
5. Being outside of the home alone.

B. The individual fears or avoids these situations because of thoughts that escape
might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like
symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear of falling
in the elderly; fear of incontinence).
C. The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.
D. The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the presence of a com-
panion, or are endured with intense fear or anxiety.
E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agora-
phobic situations and to the sociocultural context.
F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.
G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.


**138** DSM-5 Guidebook

H. If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson’s dis-
ease) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly excessive.
I. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another
mental disorder—for example, the symptoms are not confined to specific phobia,
situational type; do not involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder);
and are not related exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disor-
der), perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance (as in body dysmorphic dis-
order), reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear
of separation (as in separation anxiety disorder).

**Note:** Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic disorder. If an
individual’s presentation meets criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diag-
noses should be assigned.

Criterion A

The person with agoraphobia must report fear or anxiety arising from at least two of the
five general situations listed. The requirement of at least two such situations differentiates
agoraphobia from a specific phobia, which may be limited to one particular situation.
Also, the fear or anxiety is related exclusively to the situations and is not attributable to
more generalized anxiety that the person experiences in multiple situations.

Criterion B

The diagnosis of agoraphobia requires the person to have a cognitive ideational com-
ponent related to the fear or avoidance. This criterion emphasizes the motivation for
the avoidance, such as fear that escape will be difficult. In addition, the cognitive as-
pect of agoraphobia can be associated with fear or avoidance of the situation because
of thoughts that “help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like
symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear of falling in
the elderly; fear of incontinence),” and thereby allows for the diagnosis in the absence
of panic-like symptoms.

Criterion C

This criterion requires that the situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety and
therefore raises the threshold for making the diagnosis. A single or even occasional
event of avoiding situations due to fear would not qualify for the diagnosis.

Criterion D

DSM-5 includes the phrase “actively avoided” to minimize overdiagnosis of mild fears.

Criterion E

This criterion is new and is used to increase reliability and separation from normal fears.
The criterion evokes clinician judgment (vs. self-recognition). For example, a person with
a history of incontinence may refuse to leave home for long stretches of time, and that


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **139**

may be reasonable. If the person had only a single episode of incontinence and has re-
fused to leave home for years, then that would be out of proportion to the fear.

Criterion F

To avoid overdiagnosis of transient fear or anxiety, the duration is indicated as typi-
cally for 6 months or more. This was previously not a requirement.

Criteria G, H, and I

The degree of impairment associated with agoraphobia can vary from only avoiding sit-
uations to being entirely housebound (Criterion G). This criterion is intended to increase
separation of individuals with agoraphobia from those with mild or transient fears.
The core feature of agoraphobia is avoidance, a symptom that may be present in
a number of other disorders. The clinician should rule out other medical conditions
(e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) in which avoidance behavior may be present (Cri-
terion H). Other mental disorders also need to be ruled out (e.g., obsessive-compulsive
disorder) (Criterion I).

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by a pattern of frequent, persistent exces-
sive anxiety and worry that is out of proportion to the impact of the event or circum-
stance that is the focus of the worry. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may
not acknowledge the excessive nature of their worry, but they are bothered by their de-
gree of worry. This pattern of worry occurs “more days than not for at least 6 months”
(Criterion A). Individuals find it difficult to control this worry and report at least three
of six somatic or cognitive symptoms (or one symptom for children).
Generalized anxiety disorder was first included in DSM-III, having been split off
from anxiety neurosis. The disorder was originally considered a diagnosis of exclu-
sion, because it could not be “attributable to another mental disorder.” DSM-III also
required a 1-month duration of symptoms, but concerns later arose about the low re-
liability of the diagnosis. In DSM-III-R, the duration was increased to 6 months and the
symptom list was expanded. DSM-III-R also removed some of the hierarchical rules
that had limited the diagnosis to individuals in whom the symptoms were not due to
another disorder. Finally, in DSM-IV the list of associated symptoms was simplified
from 18 to 6, of which individuals had to exhibit at least 3. More emphasis was placed
on the pervasiveness of the worry, and the criteria were modified to accommodate child-
hood presentations. DSM-IV attempted to integrate the approach to worry across devel-
opment. In DSM-5, the diagnosis is mostly unchanged from that in DSM-IV except for
wording changes and a reorganization of the criteria.

Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder **300.02 (F41.1)**

A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days
than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work
or school performance).


**140** DSM-5 Guidebook

B. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.
C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six
symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than
not for the past 6 months):
**Note:** Only one item is required in children.

1. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge.
2. Being easily fatigued.
3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.
4. Irritability.
5. Muscle tension.
6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying
    sleep).

D. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).
F. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or
worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anx-
iety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-com-
pulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder,
reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in an-
orexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appear-
ance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety
disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).

Criteria A and B

Generalized anxiety disorder is not the same as normal worry, and these criteria are
intended to distinguish the two. Worries considered sufficient for the disorder must
be excessive. An evaluation of the intensity, frequency, and focus of worries provides
clues to whether the anxiety is excessive. The minimum duration requirement of 6
months is set high enough to distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from episodic
or short-lived events that cause worry. Furthermore, the person finds it difficult to
control the worry.

Criterion C

This item includes both somatic and cognitive aspects of generalized anxiety disor-
der. The requirement of three or more symptoms for adults and one for children is un-
changed from DSM-IV.

Criterion D

This criterion establishes a threshold by which normal worry will not become pathol-
ogized. The requirement that the worry cause significant distress or impairment should
prevent an individual from receiving this diagnosis unless the worry is severe.


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **141**

Criteria E and F

Anxiety is a frequent symptom of substance use and of several medical conditions,
which must be ruled out. Anxiety or worry is also a defining or associated feature of
many mental disorders. Criterion F provides examples of worries covered by other
diagnoses and thereby reserves the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder to those
worries not covered by other conditions. An additional diagnosis of generalized anx-
iety disorder, however, may be appropriate when the worries extend beyond the spe-
cific symptoms of another disorder.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Anxiety Disorder

For individuals with a substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, clinically sig-
nificant symptoms of panic, worry, phobia, or obsessions emerge in the context of
prescribed or illicit substance use. The differential diagnosis requires that substance
use and medications be ruled out as possible causes of anxiety before one of the other
anxiety disorders is diagnosed. Clinicians should routinely document the substance
use status of all patients and record all medications.
Clinicians should be particularly attuned to substance misuse when encountering
an anxious individual. If misuse is present, the clinician must then determine whether
it has any relationship to the ongoing anxiety symptoms. Although no definitive test
exists to establish such a causal relationship, several factors can help confirm the di-
agnosis. These include the timing of the symptoms, the existing literature pertaining
to the strength of the association between anxiety and the potential complicating fac-
tor, and signs or symptoms that are atypical of an anxiety disorder.
Onset of anxiety symptoms may occur during substance intoxication or withdrawal,
and onset of such symptoms is indicated by use of specifiers. Anxiety is associated
with multiple illicit substances (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine), alcohol, and caffeine.
The diagnosis can also be made when the anxiety is associated with use of prescrip-
tion drugs (e.g., anticholinergics, antidepressants, lithium). A diagnosis of substance-
induced anxiety disorder rather than substance intoxication or withdrawal is appropri-
ate when the anxiety symptoms predominate and are in excess of what is expected and
warrant independent clinical attention.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Anxiety Disorder

A. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
    Criterion A.


**142** DSM-5 Guidebook

C. The disturbance is not better explained by an anxiety disorder that is not sub-
stance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent anxiety disorder
could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the ces-
sation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-in-
duced anxiety disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-
related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/med-
ication]-induced anxiety disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-
10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the
clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced
anxiety disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced anxiety disor-
der”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-
induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should
record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” de-
pending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comor-
bid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then
the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-
induced anxiety disorder.

Specify if (see 16–1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di-
agnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** This specifier applies if criteria are met for intox-
ication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
**With onset during withdrawal:** This specifier applies if criteria are met for withdraw-
al from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.
**With onset after medication use:** Symptoms may appear either at initiation of
medication or after a modification or change in use.

Anxiety Disorder Due to

Another Medical Condition

Anxiety symptoms can develop in the context of identifiable medical syndromes. En-
docrine conditions (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia), cardiovascular conditions
(e.g., arrhythmia, congestive heart failure), respiratory diseases (e.g., chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, pneumonia), neurological conditions (e.g., neoplasms, en-
cephalitis), and metabolic conditions (e.g., vitamin B 12 deficiency) all may be
associated with anxiety. If another medical condition is present and determined to be
the direct physiological cause of the anxiety symptoms, then anxiety disorder due to
another medical condition should be diagnosed. When recording the diagnosis, the
clinician should include the name of the other medical condition within the name of
the mental disorder (e.g., 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma).
The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately be-
fore the anxiety disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 227.0 [D35.00] pheochro-
mocytoma; 293.84 [F06.4] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma).

Other Specified Anxiety Disorder and

Unspecified Anxiety Disorder

Because anxiety represents one of the most common psychiatric symptoms, it is not un-
common to encounter individuals who have impairment from anxiety but whose symp-
toms do not meet criteria for one of the specific anxiety disorders. These individuals are
appropriately classified as having an other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder.
The categories replace DSM-IV’s anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. Other
specified anxiety disorder is used when symptoms characteristic of an anxiety disor-
der are present and cause distress or impairment but do not meet the full criteria for
a more specific disorder in the class. The category is used when the clinician chooses
to communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet full criteria. The clini-
cian is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., limited-symptom attacks).
The category unspecified anxiety disorder is used when the individual’s symp-
toms do not meet full criteria for a more specific disorder that causes distress or im-
pairment, and the clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met
or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Anxiety Disorder **300.09 (F41.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
of the disorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The other specified anxiety dis-
order category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the
specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific anxiety
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified anxiety disorder” followed by the spe-
cific reason (e.g., “generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Limited-symptom attacks.**
2. **Generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not.**
3. **Khyâl cap (wind attacks):** See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the
    Appendix to DSM-5.
4. **Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves):** See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Dis-
    tress” in the Appendix to DSM-5.


**_Anxiety Disorders_** **145**

Unspecified Anxiety Disorder **300.00 (F41.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
any of the disorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified anxiety
disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the
reason that the criteria are not met for a specific anxiety disorder, and includes pre-
sentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis
(e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- The anxiety disorders class no longer includes obsessive-compulsive disorder,
    posttraumatic stress disorder, or acute stress disorder. Separation anxiety dis-
    order and selective mutism have been added to the class. The wording of the
    former has been changed to more adequately represent the expression of sep-
    aration anxiety symptoms in adulthood.
- For specific phobia and social anxiety disorder, changes to the criteria include
    deletion of the requirement that adults recognize their anxiety as excessive or
    unreasonable. Instead, the anxiety should be “out of proportion” to the actual
    danger or threat, after sociocultural factors are taken into account. The typical
    minimum 6-month duration, which was limited to individuals younger than age
    18 years, has been extended to persons of all ages.
- The specific phobia criteria are reworded so that the chance of encountering the
    phobic stimulus is no longer a determinant of whether an individual receives the
    diagnosis. The different stimulus types of specific phobias (now specifiers) are
    mostly unchanged.
- With social anxiety disorder, the “generalized” specifier has been dropped and
    replaced with a “performance only” specifier.
- Panic disorder and agoraphobia have been unlinked. The specifier “with panic
    attacks” can be used for any anxiety disorder, other mental disorders, and some
    medical conditions.
