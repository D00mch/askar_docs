312.31 (F63.0)** Gambling Disorder

The substance-related disorders are divided according to 10 classes
of substances: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens; inhalants; opioids; sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; tobacco; and other (or unknown) substances.
These are presented in separate sections, but they are not fully distinct because all
drugs taken in excess activate the brain’s reward circuitry, and their co-occurring use
is common. Instead of achieving reward system activation through adaptive behav-
iors, drugs of abuse short-circuit the normal processes that directly activate these
structures. Each class produces a range of behavioral effects, including the “high”


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **313**

that fuels their use. The hallucinogens are an exception in that curiosity rather than
euphoria is a major motivation for taking them.
Many substances described in this chapter, along with some prescribed and over-
the-counter drugs, can also cause substance-induced disorders that resemble indepen-
dent mood or anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, or other disorders, except that
the substance-induced disorders are usually temporary. These categories of disorder
are discussed in the relevant chapters on the basis of symptoms (e.g., anxiety disorders,
depressive disorders).
An important departure from DSM-IV is that the current chapter now includes
gambling disorder, formerly listed as pathological gambling in the chapter “Impulse-
Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified.” The disorder has been moved because
of evidence showing that gambling activates the same brain reward system, with ef-
fects similar to those produced by drugs of abuse (Potenza 2006). Other behaviors (the
so-called _behavioral addictions_ , such as Internet use and compulsive shopping) appear
to have a similar effect on reward systems, but the Substance-Related Disorders Work
Group concluded that the research on these behaviors was insufficient for their inclu-
sion. Nonetheless, Internet gaming disorder has been placed in the chapter “Conditions
for Further Study” in Section III to encourage research.
The substance use disorders have been recognized in all DSM editions. In DSM-I,
the _addictions_ (alcoholism, drug addiction) were placed within the umbrella category
“sociopathic personality disturbance,” reflecting the thinking at the time that individ-
uals with these problems were ill in terms of “society and of conformity with the pre-
vailing cultural milieu” (p. 38). In DSM-II, _alcoholism_ and the renamed _drug dependence_
were placed within the class “personality disorders and certain other non-psychotic
mental disorders.” Alcoholism was further divided into _episodic excessive drinking,
habitual excessive drinking,_ and _alcohol addiction._ The latter diagnosis was reserved for
individuals considered dependent on alcohol. Ten subcategories were created for var-
ious drug dependencies (e.g., “opium, opium alkaloids, and their derivatives”). In
DSM-III, the substance use disorders were finally given their own chapter, and the
class was greatly expanded to recognize the many drugs that were commonly mis-
used. Criteria, as well as the major divisions of abuse and dependence, were devel-
oped for DSM-III, with refinement of the diagnostic class continuing in DSM-5.
The chapter is organized such that disorders (i.e., use disorders, intoxication, and
withdrawal) are placed according to substance. The broad diagnostic categories asso-
ciated with each specific group of substances are shown in Table 16–1. Stimulant-
related disorder diagnoses have replaced the categories for amphetamine and cocaine
use disorders. Cannabis use disorder and cannabis withdrawal are new. Caffeine with-
drawal has been elevated to the status of an independent disorder from DSM-IV’s Ap-
pendix B, “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study.” Nicotine use disorders
are now called tobacco-related disorders_._
Perhaps the most important change is that a distinction is no longer made be-
tween “abuse” of and “dependence” on alcohol or other drugs, and the two diagno-
ses have been merged. In fact, the term _dependence_ is not used in this chapter in DSM-
5 to avoid overlap with the use of the term to describe pharmacological tolerance and
withdrawal. Also, rather than having generic “substance abuse” and “substance de-

pendence” criteria sets, each class of drug has its own criteria set for a “use disorder.”
The historic distinction had been based on the belief that a dependence syndrome was
a psychobiological process leading to impaired control resulting from persistent,
heavy drinking or drug use. A dependence syndrome was thought to have a different
cause from that of excessive alcohol or drug use that resulted only in social or per-
sonal problems, giving rise to a “biaxial” concept of substance misuse, with depen-
dence on one axis and consequences (i.e., abuse) on the other. These concepts were
incorporated into the substance use disorders chapters in DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and
DSM-IV. Furthermore, in DSM-III-R and DSM-IV, dependence took precedence hier-
archically over abuse. DSM-IV required that three of seven criteria be met for depen-
dence and one of four for abuse.
There were several reasons to combine abuse and dependence. First, clinicians
had trouble distinguishing the syndromes. Whereas studies showed that test-retest
reliability of DSM-IV dependence was uniformly very good to excellent, the reliability
of DSM-IV abuse was lower and more variable. Many assumed that abuse was often a
prodromal phase of dependence, but several prospective studies showed that this
was not the case. Second, epidemiological studies showed that the most common way
for DSM-IV alcohol abuse to be diagnosed was with a single criterion (Criterion A2)—
that is, hazardous use (generally driving after drinking). Although this behavior is
certainly unwise and risky, basing a psychiatric diagnosis on a single symptom is
questionable. Third, the division between abuse and dependence led to “diagnostic
orphans,” whereby a person could meet two criteria for dependence but none for
abuse. Such individuals, who could have substance use problems of the same severity
as others with a diagnosis, were left undiagnosed. Subsequent analyses on the struc-
ture of abuse and dependence in clinical and epidemiological samples suggested that
DSM-IV abuse and dependence criteria could be considered to form a unidimen-
sional structure, with abuse and dependence criteria interspersed across the severity
spectrum. Considering this evidence, the work group recommended that abuse and
dependence be combined into a single disorder of graded clinical severity, with two
criteria required for the diagnosis (Helzer et al. 2006). An additional recommendation
was to eliminate the legal problems criterion for addictive disorders (Criterion A3 for
DSM-IV substance abuse). Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol
and Related Conditions and other studies had shown that the item had a low preva-
lence relative to other criteria and that its deletion would have little effect on the prev-
alence of substance use disorders, while adding little information to the diagnoses in
the aggregate. For that reason, the criterion has been deleted from the criteria sets for all
addictive disorders.
Intoxication is a separate disorder for each substance. _Intoxication_ is considered a
reversible substance-specific syndrome resulting from the recent use of a substance.
The _disorder_ of intoxication requires that this syndrome result in clinically significant
impairment or problematic behavioral or psychological changes. Likewise, _with-
drawal_ is listed for most of the substances as a distinct disorder. The drug withdrawal
syndrome consists of a cluster of symptoms that 1) are valid and reliably observed and
2) have a clear time course that includes onset closely following cessation of the drug
and a return to baseline levels. Furthermore, the syndrome must be pharmacologi-


**316** DSM-5 Guidebook

cally specific to deprivation of the drug or one of its components and associated with
clinically important consequences (e.g., contributes to relapse, causes significant phys-
ical or psychological problems).
Finally, _craving_ is defined as a strong desire for a substance, usually a specific sub-
stance. It is a common symptom and tends to be present toward the severe end of the
severity spectrum. It has been variously defined as a trait with a time component
(present or recent past) or as a lifetime component (ever experienced in one’s life). As
a time-limited state, craving has often been frequently used as an outcome measure,
and brain imaging studies have demonstrated subjective craving precipitated by
drug-related cues and correlated with increased activity and dopamine release in spe-
cific parts of the brain reward system. On the basis of these data, craving has been
added as a symptom for substance use disorders.
Each of the substance use disorders, as well as gambling disorder, has specifiers
for “early remission” and “sustained remission.” “In early remission” indicates that
for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months, none of the items in Criterion A have
been met except the criterion relating to craving. “In sustained remission” indicates none
of the items in Criterion A have been met for 12 months or longer, except the criterion
relating to craving. Gambling disorder has the same definitions for early and sus-
tained remission but does not include the craving exception because that is not a cri-
terion for gambling disorder. In the case of opioid and tobacco use disorders, the
specifier “on maintenance therapy” may also be used. This additional specifier is used
if the individual is taking a prescribed agonist medication, such as methadone or bu-
prenorphine, or nicotine replacement medication, and none of the criteria for opioid
or tobacco use disorder have been met for that class of medication (except tolerance
to, or withdrawal from, the agonist or replacement medication).
The additional specifier “in a controlled environment” indicates that the person
has been in an environment where access to alcohol and drugs is restricted, such as
jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units. The “controlled environ-
ment” specifier does not apply to gambling disorder. Finally, each use disorder has a
severity specifier (mild, moderate, severe) based on the number of criteria met for
that disorder. Unlike the substance use disorders, gambling disorder has the addi-
tional specifier for whether the disorder is episodic (i.e., meeting diagnostic criteria at
more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling
disorder for at least several months) or persistent (i.e., continuous symptoms meeting
diagnostic criteria for multiple years) (Table 16–2).

ALCOHOL-RELATED DISORDERS

Alcohol is a commonly abused substance throughout the world and is associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. At some point in their lives, at least 80% of adults
in the United States have had some experience with alcohol, and a substantial per-
centage have had one or more alcohol-related adverse events.
This section contains discussion specific to the alcohol-related disorders to convey
their unique features. Alcohol-induced disorders are also described in DSM-5 sec-
tions on disorders with which they share symptoms.

Alcohol Use Disorder

Alcohol use disorder describes a problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress. Two or more of 11 problematic behaviors must occur
within a 12-month period for the diagnosis to be made. This diagnosis replaces the cli-
nician’s choice in DSM-IV for a diagnosis of alcohol “abuse” or “dependence,” and the
11 DSM-5 symptoms represent a merging of those listed for each DSM-IV disorder. The
diagnosis of abuse required one of four symptoms, whereas dependence required three
of seven symptoms.
Although the criteria are not differentially weighted, clinicians historically have
often paid special attention to tolerance and withdrawal (particularly the latter) as in-
dications of a physiological component. Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by with-
drawal symptoms that develop 4–12 hours after the reduction of intake following


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **319**

prolonged, heavy ingestion. Because withdrawal can be unpleasant and intense, in-
dividuals who experience this condition may continue to consume alcohol despite its
adverse consequences. Some withdrawal symptoms, such as sleep problems, can per-
sist at a lower intensity for months and are felt to contribute to relapse. A minority of
individuals with an alcohol use disorder never experience clinically relevant levels of
alcohol withdrawal, and less than 10% ever experience severe complications, such as
delirium or seizures.
Craving is indicated by a strong desire to drink that makes it difficult to think of
much else. School and job performance may suffer either from the effects of drinking
or from actual intoxication on the job or at school. Child care or household responsi-
bilities may be neglected. Alcohol-related absences may occur as well. The individual
may use alcohol in physically hazardous circumstances. Finally, individuals with al-
cohol use disorder may continue to consume alcohol despite the knowledge that con-
tinued consumption poses significant social or interpersonal problems for them.

Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or
distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intend-
    ed.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alco-
hol use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alco-
hol, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.
5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at
work, school, or home.
6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-
sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
    duced because of alcohol use.
8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.
9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacer-
bated by alcohol.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or
desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of al-
cohol.


**320** DSM-5 Guidebook

11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
    a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to Criteria A and B
       of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal).
    b. Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken
       to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for alcohol use disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder have been met for at least 3 months
but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use alcohol,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for alcohol use disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder have been met at any time during
a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or
a strong desire or urge to use alcohol,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to alcohol is restricted.

**Code based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an alcohol intoxica-
tion, alcohol withdrawal, or another alcohol-induced mental disorder is also present,
do not use the codes below for alcohol use disorder. Instead, the comorbid alcohol
use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the alcohol-induced disorder code
(see the coding note for alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, or a specific alcohol-
induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid alcohol intoxication and
alcohol use disorder, only the alcohol intoxication code is given, with the 4th character
indicating whether the comorbid alcohol use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F10.129 for mild alcohol use disorder with alcohol intoxication or F10.229 for a mod-
erate or severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol intoxication.

Specify current severity:
**305.00 (F10.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**303.90 (F10.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**303.90 (F10.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Alcohol Intoxication

The essential feature of alcohol intoxication is the presence of clinically significant
problematic behavioral or psychological changes that develop in the context of the in-
gestion of alcohol. These changes are accompanied by evidence of impaired func-
tioning and judgment and, if intoxication is intense, can result in a life-threatening
situation. The symptoms must not be better explained by another medical condition,
are not a reflection of conditions such as delirium, and are not related to intoxication
with other depressant drugs such as sedatives and hypnotics. The levels of incoordi-
nation can interfere with driving abilities and with performing usual activities to the
point of causing accidents.
Alcohol intoxication is sometimes associated with amnesia for the events that oc-
curred during the course of the intoxication (“blackouts”). This phenomenon may be


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **321**

related to the presence of high blood alcohol levels and, perhaps, to the rapidity with
which this level is reached. Even during mild alcohol intoxication, different symp-
toms are likely to be observed at different time points. Evidence of mild intoxication
can be seen in most people after approximately two drinks. Early in the drinking pe-
riod, with blood alcohol levels rising, symptoms often include talkativeness, a sense
of well-being, and a bright, expansive mood. Later, particularly when levels are falling,
the individuals likely become progressively more depressed, withdrawn, and cogni-
tively impaired. At very high levels, a nontolerant person is likely to fall asleep and
enter a first stage of anesthesia. Higher blood alcohol levels can cause inhibition of res-
piration and pulse and even death.

Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Intoxication

A. Recent ingestion of alcohol.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., inap-
propriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment) that de-
veloped during, or shortly after, alcohol ingestion.
C. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly af-
ter, alcohol use:

1. Slurred speech.
2. Incoordination.
3. Unsteady gait.
4. Nystagmus.
5. Impairment in attention or memory.
6. Stupor or coma.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better
explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **303.00.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether there is a comorbid alcohol use disorder. If a mild alcohol use disorder is co-
morbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F10.129,** and if a moderate or severe alcohol use dis-
order is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F10.229.** If there is no comorbid alcohol use
disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F10.929.**

Alcohol Withdrawal

The essential feature of alcohol withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic syn-
drome that develops after the cessation of or reduction in heavy and prolonged alco-
hol use. The withdrawal syndrome includes two or more of the symptoms listed in
Criterion B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or functional impair-
ment. The symptoms must not be due to another medical condition or mental or sub-
stance-related disorder. Symptoms can be relieved by the use of alcohol or the admin-
istration of benzodiazepines. The withdrawal symptoms typically begin when blood
concentrations of alcohol decline sharply, generally within 4–12 hours after alcohol


**322** DSM-5 Guidebook

use has stopped or been reduced. Because of the relatively fast metabolism of alcohol,
the intensity of symptoms usually peaks during the second day of abstinence and the
symptoms generally improve after 4–5 days from the last alcohol use. Symptoms of
anxiety, insomnia, and autonomic dysfunction may persist for up to 6 months at
lower levels of intensity.

Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Withdrawal

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use that has been heavy and prolonged.
B. Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours to a few days after
the cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use described in Criterion A:

1. Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or pulse rate greater than 100 bpm).
2. Increased hand tremor.
3. Insomnia.
4. Nausea or vomiting.
5. Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions.
6. Psychomotor agitation.
7. A n x i e t y.
8. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from
another substance.

Specify if:
**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier applies in the rare instance when
hallucinations (usually visual or tactile) occur with intact reality testing, or auditory,
visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **291.81.** The ICD-10-CM code for alcohol withdraw-
al without perceptual disturbances is **F10.239,** and the ICD-10-CM code for alcohol with-
drawal with perceptual disturbances is **F10.232.** Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates
the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder, reflecting the fact
that alcohol withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe alcohol
use disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild alcohol use disorder with alco-
hol withdrawal.

Other Alcohol-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other alcohol-induced disorders, such as alcohol-
induced anxiety disorder or alcohol-induced sleep disorder, when the symptoms are
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention from intoxication or
withdrawal.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **323**

Unspecified alcohol-related disorder can be diagnosed when symptoms that cause
clinically significant distress or functional impairment do not meet full criteria for
other disorders in this diagnostic class.

CAFFEINE-RELATED DISORDERS

Caffeine is one of the most commonly used psychoactive substances in the world.
Coffee is one of the most potent sources of caffeine, although certain “energy” drinks
may have more caffeine per ounce than coffee. Tea, soft drinks, and chocolate have
less caffeine. Caffeine is also found in nonprescription products such as those for
headaches.
Available scientific evidence supports the diagnoses of both caffeine intoxication
and caffeine withdrawal. Some caffeine users, however, appear to display symptoms
consistent with problematic use. Because data are not available at this time to deter-
mine the clinical significance of or scientific foundation for a caffeine use disorder,
proposed criteria for caffeine use disorder are included in DSM-5 Section III to facili-
tate research (see Chapter 22, “Conditions for Further Study”).

Caffeine Intoxication

Essential features of caffeine intoxication are recent consumption of caffeine and five
or more symptoms that develop during or shortly after caffeine use. Symptoms that
can appear following the ingestion of as little as 200 mg of caffeine (i.e., 1–2 cups of
coffee) per day include restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face,
diuresis, and gastrointestinal complaints. More severe symptoms, such as muscle
twitching, rambling flow of thought or speech, tachycardia, periods of inexhaustibil-
ity, and psychomotor agitation, generally appear at levels of more than 1 g/day. Caf-
feine intoxication may not occur despite a high caffeine intake, however, because of
the development of tolerance in some persons. For this diagnosis, the symptoms must
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning.
Prevalence of the disorder is unclear, but research suggests that about 7% of indi-
viduals in the general population experience five or more symptoms along with func-
tional impairment consistent with the diagnosis of caffeine intoxication. Symptoms
usually remit within the first day or so and do not have any known long-lasting con-
sequences.

Diagnostic Criteria for Caffeine Intoxication **305.90 (F15.929)**

A. Recent consumption of caffeine (typically a high dose well in excess of 250 mg).
B. Five (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly after,
caffeine use:

1. Restlessness.


**324** DSM-5 Guidebook

2. Nervousness.
3. Excitement.
4. Insomnia.
5. Flushed face.
6. Diuresis.
    7. Gastrointestinal disturbance.
8. Muscle twitching.
9. Rambling flow of thought and speech.
10. Tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia.
11. Periods of inexhaustibility.
12. Psychomotor agitation.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another sub-
stance.

Caffeine Withdrawal

Caffeine withdrawal is new to DSM-5. The diagnosis was included in DSM-IV’s Appen-
dix B, “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study,” to encourage further re-
search. The major reason it was not previously included as a full-fledged disorder is
that the syndrome was not considered severe enough to warrant clinical attention. Re-
search has since accumulated to show that caffeine withdrawal can produce distress
and impairment. The severity of symptoms can vary from mild to extreme. Overall,
rates of functional impairment vary from about 10% to as high as 55%. Several lines
of evidence indicate that repeated caffeine use can produce a physical dependence state
that impairs the user ’s ability to control caffeine use.
Because caffeine is often integrated into social customs and daily rituals, caffeine con-
sumers may be unaware of their physical dependence on caffeine. Thus, withdrawal
symptoms can be unexpected and misattributed to other causes. Furthermore, with-
drawal symptoms may occur when individuals are required to abstain from foods and
beverages prior to medical procedures, or when a caffeine dose is missed because of a
change in routine. The probability and severity of withdrawal symptoms are generally
related to usual daily caffeine dose, but there is a large variability among (and within)
individuals in the incidence, severity, and time course of withdrawal.

Diagnostic Criteria for Caffeine Withdrawal **292.0 (F15.93)**

A. Prolonged daily use of caffeine.
B. Abrupt cessation of or reduction in caffeine use, followed within 24 hours by three
(or more) of the following signs or symptoms:


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **325**

1. Headache.
2. Marked fatigue or drowsiness.
3. Dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability.
4. Difficulty concentrating.
5. Flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or muscle pain/stiffness).

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not associated with the physiological effects of another
medical condition (e.g., migraine, viral illness) and are not better explained by an-
other mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

Other Caffeine-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other caffeine-induced disorders, such as caffeine-
induced anxiety disorder and caffeine-induced sleep disorder, instead of caffeine in-
toxication or caffeine withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to
warrant independent clinical attention. Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified
caffeine-related disorder if they have symptoms characteristic of a caffeine-related
disorder that are not classifiable as caffeine intoxication, caffeine withdrawal, or a caf-
feine-induced disorder.

CANNABIS-RELATED DISORDERS

Cannabis-related disorders may result from use of _Cannabis sativa,_ commonly re-
ferred to as marijuana, weed, pot, herb, grass, reefer, and so on. The concentration ex-
tract from cannabis (hashish) is also commonly used. _Cannabis_ is a generic term and also
refers to other forms, including synthetic cannabinoid compounds. Synthetic oral for-
mulations are available by prescription for medical indications in some areas. The pri-
mary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-
THC). Cannabis has diverse effects on the brain, prominent among which are actions
on CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors found throughout the central nervous system.
Cannabis that is generally available varies greatly in potency. Although cannabis is
more commonly smoked, it is sometimes ingested orally after being mixed into food.
Also, devices have been developed in which cannabis is “vaporized.” A new disorder
listed in DSM-5 is cannabis withdrawal.

Cannabis Use Disorder

People who regularly use cannabis can develop all the general diagnostic features of
a substance use disorder. Cannabis use disorder may occur by itself, but it frequently
occurs along with use of other substances, such as alcohol, cocaine, and opioids. Peo-
ple who abuse multiple types of substances may minimize the impact of symptoms
related to cannabis. Pharmacological and behavioral tolerance to most of the effects


**326** DSM-5 Guidebook

of cannabis have been reported in people who use the drug chronically. Tolerance is
lost when cannabis use is discontinued for a significant period of time. Abrupt cessa-
tion of daily or near-daily use can result in withdrawal symptoms such as irritability,
anger, anxiety, depressed mood, restlessness, and sleep difficulty.
People with a cannabis use disorder may use cannabis throughout the day for pe-
riods of months or years and may spend many hours per day under its influence. Oth-
ers may use less frequently but still experience recurrent use-related problems. Use of
cannabis at home may lead to arguments with spouses or parents, and its use in the
presence of children can adversely impact family functioning. Use of cannabis on the
job or while working at a job that requires drug testing can be a sign of a cannabis use
disorder. Those who continue using despite knowledge of physical or psychological
problems show evidence of a disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of cannabis use leading to clinically significant impairment or
distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1. Cannabis is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was in-
    tended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control cannabis
    use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain cannabis, use canna-
    bis, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis.
5. Recurrent cannabis use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,
    school, or home.
6. Continued cannabis use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-
    sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of cannabis.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced
because of cannabis use.
8. Recurrent cannabis use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.
9. Cannabis use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
    physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated
    by cannabis.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of cannabis to achieve intoxication
or desired effect.
b. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of cannabis.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for cannabis (refer to Criteria A and
B of the criteria set for cannabis withdrawal).
b. Cannabis (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid with-
drawal symptoms.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **327**

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for cannabis use disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for cannabis use disorder have been met for at least 3 months
but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use cannabis,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for cannabis use disorder were previ-
ously met, none of the criteria for cannabis use disorder have been met at any time
during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Crav-
ing, or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis,” may be present).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to cannabis is restricted.

**Code based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a cannabis intoxica-
tion, cannabis withdrawal, or another cannabis-induced mental disorder is also present,
do not use the codes below for cannabis use disorder. Instead, the comorbid cannabis
use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the cannabis-induced disorder code
(see the coding note for cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or a specific can-
nabis-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid cannabis-induced
anxiety disorder and cannabis use disorder, only the cannabis-induced anxiety disorder
code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid cannabis use dis-
order is mild, moderate, or severe: F12.180 for mild cannabis use disorder with canna-
bis-induced anxiety disorder or F12.280 for a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder
with cannabis-induced anxiety disorder.
Specify current severity:
**305.20 (F12.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**304.30 (F12.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.30 (F12.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Cannabis Intoxication

The essential feature of cannabis intoxication is the presence of clinically significant
problematic behavioral or psychological changes that develop during or shortly after
cannabis use. Intoxication usually begins with a “high,” followed by symptoms that
include euphoria with inappropriate laughter and grandiosity, sedation, lethargy, im-
pairment in short-term memory, difficulty carrying out complex mental processes,
and impaired judgment. Occasionally, anxiety, dysphoria, or social withdrawal may
occur. These effects are accompanied by two or more of the following physical signs,
developing within 2 hours of cannabis use: conjunctival injection, increased appetite,
dry mouth, and tachycardia.
Intoxication develops within minutes if cannabis is smoked but may take a few
hours to develop if orally ingested. The effects usually last 3–4 hours, the duration be-
ing somewhat longer when the substance is ingested orally.


**328** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Cannabis Intoxication

A. Recent use of cannabis.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., im-
paired motor coordination, euphoria, anxiety, sensation of slowed time, impaired
judgment, social withdrawal) that developed during, or shortly after, cannabis use.
C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing within 2 hours of can-
nabis use:

1. Conjunctival injection.
2. Increased appetite.
3. Dry mouth.
4. Tachycardia.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another sub-
stance.

Specify if:
**With perceptual disturbances:** Hallucinations with intact reality testing or audi-
tory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
or not there is a comorbid cannabis use disorder and whether or not there are percep-
tual disturbances.

```
For cannabis intoxication, without perceptual disturbances: If a mild canna-
bis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.129, and if a moderate
or severe cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.229. If
there is no comorbid cannabis use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F12.929.
For cannabis intoxication, with perceptual disturbances: If a mild cannabis
use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.122, and if a moderate or
severe cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.222. If
there is no comorbid cannabis use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F12.922.
```
Cannabis Withdrawal

Research on cannabis withdrawal conducted since the publication of DSM-IV clearly
supports its inclusion in DSM-5. Studies have shown that the syndrome can be reli-
ably identified and that it has a time course typical of other substance withdrawal
syndromes. Nonhuman and human laboratory studies provide clear evidence of the
pharmacological specificity of the withdrawal syndrome. Furthermore, research sug-
gests that the syndrome is not rare.
Evidence also shows that the syndrome is clinically important. Cannabis users re-
port using cannabis to relieve withdrawal symptoms, suggesting that withdrawal
might contribute to ongoing abuse. A substantial proportion of adults and adoles-
cents in treatment for cannabis use admit to moderate to severe withdrawal symp-


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **329**

toms, and report that these symptoms make cessation more difficult. People living
with cannabis users observe significant withdrawal effects, suggesting that such symp-
toms are disruptive to daily living.

Diagnostic Criteria for Cannabis Withdrawal **292.0 (F12.288)**

A. Cessation of cannabis use that has been heavy and prolonged (i.e., usually daily
or almost daily use over a period of at least a few months).
B. Three (or more) of the following signs and symptoms develop within approximately
1 week after Criterion A:

1. Irritability, anger, or aggression.
2. Nervousness or anxiety.
3. Sleep difficulty (e.g., insomnia, disturbing dreams).
4. Decreased appetite or weight loss.
5. Restlessness.
6. Depressed mood.
7. At least one of the following physical symptoms causing significant discomfort:
abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors, sweating, fever, chills, or headache.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal
from another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for cannabis with-
drawal is F12.288. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of
a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder, reflecting the fact that cannabis with-
drawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use disor-
der. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild cannabis use disorder with cannabis
withdrawal.

Other Cannabis-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other cannabis-induced disorders, such as cannabis-
induced psychotic disorder, cannabis-induced anxiety disorder, cannabis-induced
sleep disorder, or cannabis intoxication delirium, instead of cannabis intoxication or
cannabis withdrawal when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant indepen-
dent clinical attention. Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified cannabis-related
disorder if they have symptoms characteristic of a cannabis-related disorder that are
not classifiable as cannabis use disorder, cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal,
or a cannabis-induced disorder.

HALLUCINOGEN-RELATED DISORDERS

Phencyclidine and Other Hallucinogen

Use Disorders

Hallucinogens have been used for thousands of years and in multiple cultures. They
include LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), mescaline, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine), and psilocybin. DSM-IV contained separate sections for phency-
clidine and for hallucinogenic drugs. From both clinical and pharmacological per-
spectives, however, phencyclidine is a drug of abuse with hallucinogenic properties.
For that reason, DSM-5 has included phencyclidine in the clinically similar but phar-
macologically heterogeneous category of hallucinogens. All drugs in this category
produce hallucinations, but by different mechanisms.

Diagnostic Criteria for Phencyclidine Use Disorder

A. A pattern of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar substance) use leading
to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period:

1. Phencyclidine is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was
    intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control phen-
cyclidine use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain phencyclidine, use
the phencyclidine, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use phencyclidine.
5. Recurrent phencyclidine use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at
work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work or poor work perfor-
mance related to phencyclidine use; phencyclidine-related absences, suspen-
sions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household).
6. Continued phencyclidine use despite having persistent or recurrent social or in-
terpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the phencyclidine
(e.g., arguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication; physical
fights).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
duced because of phencyclidine use.
8. Recurrent phencyclidine use in situations in which it is physically hazardous
(e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by a phen-
cyclidine). 
9. Phencyclidine use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or re-
current physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by the phencyclidine.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **331**

10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
    a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the phencyclidine to achieve in-
       toxication or desired effect.
    b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
       phencyclidine.

**Note:** Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established for phencyclidines, and so
this criterion does not apply. (Withdrawal from phencyclidines has been reported in an-
imals but not documented in human users.)

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for phencyclidine use disorder were previous-
ly met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine use disorder have been met for at
least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4,
“Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the phencyclidine,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for phencyclidine use disorder were pre-
viously met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine use disorder have been met at any
time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4,
“Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the phencyclidine,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to phencyclidines is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a phencyclidine in-
toxication or another phencyclidine-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use
the codes below for phencyclidine use disorder. Instead, the comorbid phencyclidine
use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the phencyclidine-induced disorder code
(see the coding note for phencyclidine intoxication or a specific phencyclidine-induced
mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid phencyclidine-induced psychotic dis-
order, only the phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder code is given, with the 4th char-
acter indicating whether the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is mild, moderate, or
severe: F16.159 for mild phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced psychot-
ic disorder or F16.259 for a moderate or severe phencyclidine use disorder with phency-
clidine-induced psychotic disorder.
Specify current severity:
**305.90 (F16.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**304.60 (F16.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.60 (F16.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Diagnostic Criteria for Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine) use leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the fol-
lowing, occurring within a 12-month period:

1. The hallucinogen is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than
    was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control hal-
    lucinogen use.


**332** DSM-5 Guidebook

3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the hallucinogen,
    use the hallucinogen, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen.
5. Recurrent hallucinogen use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations
    at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work or poor work per-
    formance related to hallucinogen use; hallucinogen-related absences, suspen-
    sions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household).
6. Continued hallucinogen use despite having persistent or recurrent social or inter-
personal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the hallucinogen (e.g.,
arguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication; physical fights).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
duced because of hallucinogen use.
8. Recurrent hallucinogen use in situations in which it is physically hazard-
    ous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by the
    hallucinogen).
9. Hallucinogen use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or re-
    current physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
    exacerbated by the hallucinogen.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the hallucinogen to achieve in-
toxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
hallucinogen.

**Note:** Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established for hallucinogens, and so
this criterion does not apply.

Specify **the particular hallucinogen.**

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder were pre-
viously met, none of the criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder have been met
for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion
A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder were
previously met, none of the criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder have been
met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Cri-
terion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to hallucinogens is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a hallucinogen intox-
ication or another hallucinogen-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the
codes below for hallucinogen use disorder. Instead, the comorbid hallucinogen use dis-
order is indicated in the 4th character of the hallucinogen-induced disorder code (see the
coding note for hallucinogen intoxication or specific hallucinogen-induced mental disor-
der). For example, if there is comorbid hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder and hal-
lucinogen use disorder, only the hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder code is given,
with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid hallucinogen use disorder is mild,


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **333**

moderate, or severe: F16.159 for mild hallucinogen use disorder with hallucinogen-in-
duced psychotic disorder or F16.259 for a moderate or severe hallucinogen use disorder
with hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder.
Specify current severity:
**305.30 (F16.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**304.50 (F16.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.50 (F16.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Phencyclidine Intoxication and

Other Hallucinogen Intoxication

Phencyclidine intoxication and other hallucinogen intoxication reflect the clinically
significant behavioral or psychological changes that occur shortly after ingestion of a
substance. Depending on the specific agent, intoxication lasts minutes to hours. In-
toxication with phencyclidine differs from that with other hallucinogens. With phen-
cyclidine intoxication, the individual may experience nystagmus, seizures, ataxia,
dysarthria, hypertension, and hyperacusis. By contrast, individuals with other hallu-
cinogen intoxication experience tachycardia, blurred vision, tremors, and sweating,
among other symptoms. Behavioral changes such as belligerence, assaultiveness, un-
predictability, and psychomotor agitation occur with phencyclidine intoxication,
whereas other hallucinogen intoxication may present with marked anxiety or de-
pression, ideas of reference, fear of “losing one’s mind,” and paranoid ideation. Ad-
ditionally, other hallucinogen intoxication may result in perceptual changes such as
depersonalization, derealization, hallucinations, and synesthesias that occur during,
or shortly after, hallucinogen use.
Intoxication with either phencyclidine or other hallucinogens should be differen-
tiated from intoxication with stimulants, anticholinergics, inhalants, or other drugs of
abuse. Toxicological tests can be useful in making this distinction. Other conditions to
consider include mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and withdrawal from other
substances. The perceptual disturbances and impaired judgment associated with hal-
lucinogen intoxication can result in injuries or fatalities from motor vehicle accidents,
physical fights, or unintentional self-injury.

Diagnostic Criteria for Phencyclidine Intoxication

A. Recent use of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar substance).
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral changes (e.g., belligerence, assaul-
tiveness, impulsiveness, unpredictability, psychomotor agitation, impaired judg-
ment) that developed during, or shortly after, phencyclidine use.
C. Within 1 hour, two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms:

```
Note: When the drug is smoked, “snorted,” or used intravenously, the onset may
be particularly rapid.
```

**334** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. Vertical or horizontal nystagmus.
2. Hypertension or tachycardia.
3. Numbness or diminished responsiveness to pain.
4. Ataxia.
5. Dysarthria.
6. Muscle rigidity.
    7. Seizures or coma.
8. Hyperacusis.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another sub-
stance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
there is a comorbid phencyclidine use disorder. If a mild phencyclidine use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.129,** and if a moderate or severe phencyclidine
use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.229.** If there is no comorbid
phencyclidine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.929.**

Diagnostic Criteria for Other Hallucinogen Intoxication

A. Recent use of a hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine).
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., marked
anxiety or depression, ideas of reference, fear of “losing one’s mind,” paranoid ideation,
impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, hallucinogen use.
C. Perceptual changes occurring in a state of full wakefulness and alertness (e.g.,
subjective intensification of perceptions, depersonalization, derealization, illusions,
hallucinations, synesthesias) that developed during, or shortly after, hallucinogen
use.
D. Two (or more) of the following signs developing during, or shortly after, hallucino-
gen use:

1. Pupillary dilation.
2. Tachycardia.
3. Sweating.
4. Palpitations.
5. Blurring of vision.
6. Tremors.
7. Incoordination.

E. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether there is a comorbid hallucinogen use disorder. If a mild hallucinogen use dis-
order is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.129,** and if a moderate or severe hal-


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **335**

lucinogen use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.229.** If there is no
comorbid hallucinogen use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.929.**

Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder

Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder involves the reexperiencing of one or
more of the perceptual symptoms that were experienced while intoxicated with the
hallucinogen.

Diagnostic Criteria for Hallucinogen Persisting
Perception Disorder **292.89 (F16.983)**

A. Following cessation of use of a hallucinogen, the reexperiencing of one or more of
the perceptual symptoms that were experienced while intoxicated with the halluci-
nogen (e.g., geometric hallucinations, false perceptions of movement in the periph-
eral visual fields, flashes of color, intensified colors, trails of images of moving
objects, positive afterimages, halos around objects, macropsia and micropsia).
B. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., anatomical
lesions and infections of the brain, visual epilepsies) and are not better explained
by another mental disorder (e.g., delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, schizo-
phrenia) or hypnopompic hallucinations.

Other Phencyclidine- and Other Hallucinogen-

Induced Disorders

Individuals are diagnosed with other phencyclidine- or other hallucinogen-induced dis-
order, such as phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, when the symptoms are suf-
ficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Phencyclidine- and Unspecified

Hallucinogen-Related Disorders

Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified phencyclidine- or unspecified hallucino-
gen-related disorder if they have symptoms characteristic of a phencyclidine- or other
hallucinogen-related disorder that are not classifiable as phencyclidine or other hal-
lucinogen use disorder, intoxication, withdrawal, or induced disorder.


**336** DSM-5 Guidebook

INHALANT-RELATED DISORDERS

Inhalant Use Disorder

Paint thinner, airplane glue, and gasoline are just a few of the inhalants that are com-
monplace. They enter the bloodstream quickly, have rapid onset of action, and can
damage the central nervous system, kidneys, and liver.
People who regularly use hydrocarbon-based inhalants may develop most of the
diagnostic features of a substance use disorder. One exception is withdrawal. Avail-
able scientific evidence does not support the diagnosis of inhalant withdrawal as a
disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Inhalant Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of use of a hydrocarbon-based inhalant substance leading
to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period:

1. The inhalant substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period
    than was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use
of the inhalant substance.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the inhalant sub-
stance, use it, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance.
5. Recurrent use of the inhalant substance resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home.
6. Continued use of the inhalant substance despite having persistent or recurrent
social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of its
use.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
    duced because of use of the inhalant substance.
8. Recurrent use of the inhalant substance in situations in which it is physically
hazardous.
9. Use of the inhalant substance is continued despite knowledge of having a per-
sistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been
caused or exacerbated by the substance.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the inhalant substance to
achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
inhalant substance.

Specify **the particular inhalant:** When possible, the particular substance involved
should be named (e.g., “solvent use disorder”).


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **337**

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for inhalant use disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria for inhalant use disorder have been met for at least 3 months
but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for inhalant use disorder were previous-
ly met, none of the criteria for inhalant use disorder have been met at any time dur-
ing a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving,
or a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to inhalant substances is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an inhalant intoxi-
cation or another inhalant-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the
codes below for inhalant use disorder. Instead, the comorbid inhalant use disorder is
indicated in the 4th character of the inhalant-induced disorder code (see the coding
note for inhalant intoxication or a specific inhalant-induced mental disorder). For ex-
ample, if there is comorbid inhalant-induced depressive disorder and inhalant use dis-
order, only the inhalant-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character
indicating whether the comorbid inhalant use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F18.14 for mild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced depressive disorder or
F18.24 for a moderate or severe inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced depressive
disorder.

Specify current severity:
**305.90 (F18.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**304.60 (F18.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.60 (F18.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Inhalant Intoxication

Inhalant intoxication is a clinically significant disorder that develops during, or
immediately after, intended or unintended inhalation of an inhalant substance. The
intoxication clears within a few minutes to a few hours after exposure ends. Impair-
ment from intoxication may have serious consequences with regard to job-related and
social functioning. It may also lead to traffic accidents or unintentional self-injuries.
Use of inhaled substances in a closed container, such as a plastic bag, may lead to un-
consciousness, anoxia, and death.

Diagnostic Criteria for Inhalant Intoxication

A. Recent intended or unintended short-term, high-dose exposure to inhalant sub-
stances, including volatile hydrocarbons such as toluene or gasoline.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., bel-
ligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired judgment) that developed during, or
shortly after, exposure to inhalants.


**338** DSM-5 Guidebook

C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly af-
ter, inhalant use or exposure:

1. Dizziness.
2. Nystagmus.
3. Incoordination.
4. Slurred speech.
5. Unsteady gait.
6. Lethargy.
    7. Depressed reflexes.
8. Psychomotor retardation.
9. Tremor.
10. Generalized muscle weakness.
11. Blurred vision or diplopia.
12. Stupor or coma.
13. Euphoria.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another sub-
stance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
there is a comorbid inhalant use disorder. If a mild inhalant use disorder is comorbid,
the ICD-10-CM code is **F18.129,** and if a moderate or severe inhalant use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F18.229.** If there is no comorbid inhalant use disor-
der, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F18.929.**

Other Inhalant-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Inhalant-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other inhalant-induced disorders, such as inhalant-
induced psychotic disorder, when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant in-
dependent clinical attention.
Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified inhalant-related disorder if they have
symptoms characteristic of an inhalant-related disorder that are not classifiable as in-
halant use disorder, intoxication, or induced disorder.

OPIOID-RELATED DISORDERS

The opioids include natural and synthetic substances with morphine-like actions that
are full agonists to the  opioid receptor. Medications such as buprenorphine that have
both opiate agonist and antagonist effects are also included in this class. Opioids are pre-
scribed as analgesics, anesthetics, antidiarrheal agents, and cough suppressants. After
heroin, opium is the most widely consumed illegal opiate in the world. In the United
States, the nonmedical use of prescription opioids is a significant problem. Opioid users
have a high likelihood of developing opioid use disorders and have an increased risk for
HIV, as well as hepatitis B and C viruses; mortality rates are excessive.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **339**

Opioid Use Disorder

Opioid use disorder includes signs and symptoms that reflect compulsive, prolonged
self-administration of opioid substances that are used for no legitimate medical pur-
poses or that are used in doses that are greatly in excess of the amount needed to treat
a medical condition requiring opioid treatment. Individuals with opioid use disorder
tend to develop regular patterns of compulsive drug use, such that daily activities are
planned around obtaining and administering the drugs. Opioids are usually pur-
chased on the illegal market but may also be obtained from physicians by falsifying or
exaggerating general medical problems or by receiving simultaneous prescriptions
from several physicians (“doctor shopping”). Most individuals with this disorder have
significant levels of tolerance and experience withdrawal on abrupt discontinuation
of opioid substances.
Opioid use disorder can be associated with a history of drug-related crimes, usually
related to attempts to obtain the drugs. Among health care professionals and individu-
als with ready access to controlled substances, there is often a different pattern of illegal
activities, which might involve problems with state licensing boards. Marital difficul-
ties and unemployment or other work-related problems are also associated with the
disorder.
Many people with opioid use disorder are treated with agonist, partial agonist, or
agonist/antagonist medication such as methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone.
These individuals may have a presentation that meets none of the criteria for opioid
use disorder (except perhaps tolerance or withdrawal). For these individuals, the ad-
ditional specifier “on maintenance therapy” would be merited.

Diagnostic Criteria for Opioid Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or
distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1. Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was in-
    tended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control opioid
    use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the opioid, use the
    opioid, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids.
5. Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,
    school, or home.
6. Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-
    sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of opioids.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
duced because of opioid use.
8. Recurrent opioid use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.


**340** DSM-5 Guidebook

9. Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
    physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacer-
    bated by the substance.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve intoxication or
desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of an
opioid.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking opioids solely
under appropriate medical supervision.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome (refer to Criteria A and B of
the criteria set for opioid withdrawal).
b. Opioids (or a closely related substance) are taken to relieve or avoid with-
drawal symptoms.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those individuals taking opi-
oids solely under appropriate medical supervision.

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for opioid use disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but
for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use opioids,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for opioid use disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met at any time during
a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or
a strong desire or urge to use opioids,” may be met).

Specify if:
**On maintenance therapy:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is tak-
ing a prescribed agonist medication such as methadone or buprenorphine and
none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for that class of medica-
tion (except tolerance to, or withdrawal from, the agonist). This category also applies
to those individuals being maintained on a partial agonist, an agonist/antagonist,
or a full antagonist such as oral naltrexone or depot naltrexone.
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to opioids is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an opioid intoxica-
tion, opioid withdrawal, or another opioid-induced mental disorder is also present, do
not use the codes below for opioid use disorder. Instead, the comorbid opioid use dis-
order is indicated in the 4th character of the opioid-induced disorder code (see the
coding note for opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or a specific opioid-induced
mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid opioid-induced depressive disorder
and opioid use disorder, only the opioid-induced depressive disorder code is given,
with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid opioid use disorder is mild, mod-
erate, or severe: F11.14 for mild opioid use disorder with opioid-induced depressive
disorder or F11.24 for a moderate or severe opioid use disorder with opioid-induced
depressive disorder.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **341**

Specify current severity:
**305.50 (F11.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**304.00 (F11.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.00 (F11.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Opioid Intoxication

The essential feature of opioid intoxication is the presence of abnormal behavioral or
psychological changes that develop during or shortly after opioid use. Intoxication is
accompanied by pupillary constriction and at least one of the following signs: drows-
iness, slurred speech, or impairment in attention or memory. Drowsiness may progress
to coma. People with opioid intoxication have demonstrated inattention to their en-
vironment, even to the point of ignoring potentially harmful events. The symptoms
are not explained by another medical condition or another mental disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Opioid Intoxication

A. Recent use of an opioid.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., initial
euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria, psychomotor agitation or retardation, im-
paired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, opioid use.
C. Pupillary constriction (or pupillary dilation due to anoxia from severe overdose)
and one (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly
after, opioid use:

1. Drowsiness or coma.
2. Slurred speech.
3. Impairment in attention or memory.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance.

Specify if:
**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier may be noted in the rare instance
in which hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illu-
sions occur in the absence of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether or not there is a comorbid opioid use disorder and whether or not there are
perceptual disturbances.

```
For opioid intoxication without perceptual disturbances: If a mild opioid use
disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.129, and if a moderate or severe
opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.229. If there is no co-
morbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F11.929.
For opioid intoxication with perceptual disturbances: If a mild opioid use dis-
order is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.122, and if a moderate or severe
```

**342** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.222. If there is no co-
morbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F11.922.
```
Opioid Withdrawal

The essential feature of opioid withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal
syndrome that develops after the cessation of or reduction in opioid use that has been
heavy and prolonged. The syndrome can also be precipitated by administration of an
opioid antagonist, such as naltrexone, after a period of opioid use. Symptoms include
complaints of anxiety, restlessness, and muscle aches, along with irritability and in-
creased sensitivity to pain. Other symptoms soon develop, ranging from cognitive
(dysphoric mood) to physical (e.g., nausea and vomiting, lacrimation or rhinorrhea,
piloerection, sweating) symptoms. Withdrawal may begin within 6–12 hours after the
last dose of a short-acting drug such as heroin but within 2–4 days in the case of lon-
ger-acting drugs such as methadone.

Diagnostic Criteria for Opioid Withdrawal **292.0 (F11.23)**

A. Presence of either of the following:

1. Cessation of (or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged
    (i.e., several weeks or longer).
2. Administration of an opioid antagonist after a period of opioid use.

B. Three (or more) of the following developing within minutes to several days after Crite-
rion A:

1. Dysphoric mood.
2. Nausea or vomiting.
3. Muscle aches.
4. Lacrimation or rhinorrhea.
5. Pupillary dilation, piloerection, or sweating.
6. Diarrhea.
7. Yawning.
8. Fever.
9. Insomnia.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or with-
drawal from another substance.
**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for opioid withdraw-
al is F11.23. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a mod-
erate or severe opioid use disorder, reflecting the fact that opioid withdrawal can only
occur in the presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder. It is not permissible
to code a comorbid mild opioid use disorder with opioid withdrawal.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **343**

Other Opioid-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Opioid-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other opioid-induced disorders, such as opioid-
induced psychotic disorder, when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant in-
dependent clinical attention.
Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified opioid-related disorder if they have
symptoms characteristic of an opioid-related disorder that are not classifiable as opi-
oid use disorder, intoxication, withdrawal, or induced disorder.

SEDATIVE-, HYPNOTIC-, OR ANXIOLYTIC-

RELATED DISORDERS

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances include benzodiazepines, benzodiaze-
pine-like drugs, carbamates, barbiturates, and barbiturate-like hypnotics. This class
includes all prescription sleeping medications and almost all prescription antianxiety
medications. Nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety agents (e.g., buspirone) are not in-
cluded in this class because they do not appear to be associated with significant mis-
use. At high doses, these drugs can be lethal, particularly when mixed with alcohol,
although the lethal dose varies considerably among the specific drugs. Sedative, hyp-
notic, and anxiolytic substances are available both by prescription and on the black
market. Very significant levels of tolerance to and withdrawal from these drugs can de-
velop. The social and interpersonal consequences of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder mimic those of alcohol in terms of the potential for disinhibited behavior.
Accidents, interpersonal difficulties, and interference with work or school perfor-
mance are all common.

Diagnostic Criteria for Sedative, Hypnotic, or
Anxiolytic Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following,
occurring within a 12-month period:

1. Sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are often taken in larger amounts or over a
    longer period than was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control sed-
    ative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic; use the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic; or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.


**344** DSM-5 Guidebook

5. Recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use resulting in a failure to fulfill ma-
    jor role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work
    or poor work performance related to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use; seda-
    tive-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions
    from school; neglect of children or household).
6. Continued sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use despite having persistent or re-
    current social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects
    of sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics (e.g., arguments with a spouse about
    consequences of intoxication; physical fights).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced
because of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.
8. Recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use in situations in which it is physi-
    cally hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when im-
    paired by sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use).
9. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use is continued despite knowledge of having
    a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have
    been caused or exacerbated by the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxio-
lytic to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for individuals taking sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical supervision.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for sedatives, hypnotics, or anxio-
lytics (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal).
b. Sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics (or a closely related substance, such as
alcohol) are taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for individuals taking sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical supervision.

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use dis-
order were previously met, none of the criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with
the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sed-
ative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxio-
lytic use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer
(with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a sedative, hypnot-
ic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or another
sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use
the codes below for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Instead the comor-
bid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the
sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorder (see the coding note for sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or spe-
cific sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorder). For example, if there
is comorbid sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder and seda-
tive, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, only the sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-
induced depressive disorder code is given with the 4th character indicating whether
the comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F13.14 for mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative-, hypnotic-,
or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder or F13.24 for a moderate or severe sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced de-
pressive disorder.
Specify current severity:
**305.40 (F13.10) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**304.10 (F13.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**304.10 (F13.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication

The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication is the presence
of clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes that de-
velop during or shortly after use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drug. As occurs
with other brain depressants, these behaviors may be accompanied by slurred
speech, unsteady gait, nystagmus, memory or attentional problems, levels of incoor-
dination that can interfere with driving, and stupor or coma. Memory impairment is
a prominent feature and is most often characterized by an anterograde amnesia that
resembles “alcoholic blackouts.”

Diagnostic Criteria for Sedative, Hypnotic, or
Anxiolytic Intoxication

A. Recent use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.
B. Clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., inap-
propriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment) that de-
veloped during, or shortly after, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.
C. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly af-
ter, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use:

1. Slurred speech.
2. Incoordination.


**346** DSM-5 Guidebook

3. Unsteady gait.
4. Nystagmus.
5. Impairment in cognition (e.g., attention, memory).
6. Stupor or coma.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether there is a comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. If a mild
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
**F13.129,** and if a moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.229.** If there is no comorbid sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.929.**

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal

The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is the presence
of a characteristic syndrome that develops after a marked cessation of (or decrease in)
intake after several weeks or more of regular use. This syndrome is characterized by
two or more symptoms that include, for example, autonomic hyperactivity, tremors,
insomnia, anxiety, nausea sometimes accompanied by vomiting, and psychomotor
agitation. Grand mal seizures occur in perhaps 20%–30% of people undergoing un-
treated withdrawal from these substances. In severe withdrawal, visual, tactile, or au-
ditory hallucinations or illusions can occur, but are usually in the context of a delirium.
The timing and severity of the syndrome will differ depending on specific substances
and their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The time course of the syndrome is generally predicted by the half-life of the sub-
stance. Medications whose actions typically last about 10 hours or less produce with-
drawal symptoms within 6–8 hours after levels in the blood begin decreasing. Intensity
peaks on the second day, and symptoms improve markedly by day 4 or 5. For sub-
stances with longer half-lives, symptoms may not develop for more than 1 week, peak
in intensity during the second week, and decrease in intensity during the third or
fourth week. Additional long-term symptoms can persist at a much lower level of in-
tensity for several months. Lingering withdrawal symptoms (e.g., anxiety, moodi-
ness, trouble sleeping) can be mistaken for non-substance-induced anxiety or
depressive disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Sedative, Hypnotic, or
Anxiolytic Withdrawal

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use that has been
prolonged.
B. Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours to a few days after


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **347**

```
the cessation of (or reduction in) sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use described in
Criterion A:
```
1. Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or pulse rate greater than 100 bpm).
2. Hand tremor.
3. Insomnia.
4. Nausea or vomiting.
5. Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions.
6. Psychomotor agitation.
7. Anxiety.
8. Grand mal seizures.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or with-
drawal from another substance.

Specify if:
**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier may be noted when hallucinations with
intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a de-
lirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.0.** The ICD-10-CM code for sedative, hyp-
notic, or anxiolytic withdrawal depends on whether or not there is a comorbid moder-
ate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and whether or not there
are perceptual disturbances. For sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal without
perceptual disturbances, the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.239.** For sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal with perceptual disturbances, the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.232.**
Note that the ICD-10-CM codes indicate the comorbid presence of a moderate or se-
vere sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, reflecting the fact that sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or
severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. It is not permissible to code a
comorbid mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic withdrawal.

Other Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-

Induced Disorders and Unspecified Sedative-,

Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders,
such as sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced psychotic disorder, when the symp-
toms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.
Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-
related disorder if they have symptoms characteristic of a sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-related disorder that are not classifiable as sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxio-
lytic use disorder, intoxication, withdrawal, or induced disorder.

STIMULANT-RELATED DISORDERS

Stimulant-related disorders result from use of plant-derived stimulants such as cocaine;
amphetamine and amphetamine-like drugs; and other stimulants, such as methylphe-
nidate, that are structurally different from amphetamine but have action similar to am-
phetamine-type stimulants. Although cocaine and amphetamine-like stimulant drugs
are different in some characteristics, such as their mechanisms of action, the clinical pre-
sentation related to these compounds is largely similar. Most of the effects of amphet-
amine-type stimulants are similar to those of cocaine, but there are some distinctions.
For example, unlike cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants do not have local anesthetic
activity, and their risk for inducing certain medical conditions such as cardiac arrhyth-
mias and seizures may be lower. The psychoactive effects of most amphetamine-like
substances last longer than the effects of a dose of cocaine, and the peripheral sympa-
thomimetic effects may be more potent. Cocaine and methamphetamine are almost al-
ways purchased illicitly, but amphetamine-type stimulants may also be obtained
legally by prescription for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
narcolepsy, and other medical conditions.
Drugs in the amphetamine and cocaine categories have in common the produc-
tion of intense stimulation in the user. This stimulation is the result of increases in bio-
genic amines in the central nervous system. The exact molecular mechanisms vary,
but the results are similar, as is the clinical addiction syndrome for each. Thus, in
DSM-5 all of the stimulant drugs are now described in one stimulant category rather
than separately.

Stimulant Use Disorder

Stimulants have potent euphoric effects, and individuals exposed to cocaine or am-
phetamine-type stimulants can develop a use disorder after using the drug for short
periods of time. Regardless of route of administration, tolerance occurs with repeated
use. Withdrawal symptoms, particularly hypersomnia, increased appetite, and dys-
phoric mood, can be seen and are likely to enhance craving and the likelihood of re-
lapse. People may spend large amounts of money for cocaine and amphetamine-type
stimulants within a short period of time and may also engage in criminal activity to
obtain money for stimulants.

Diagnostic Criteria for Stimulant Use Disorder

A. A pattern of amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant use leading
to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period:

1. The stimulant is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was
    intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control stimulant
use.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **349**

3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the stimulant, use
    the stimulant, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the stimulant.
5. Recurrent stimulant use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at
    work, school, or home.
6. Continued stimulant use despite having persistent or recurrent social or inter-
    personal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the stimulant.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or re-
duced because of stimulant use.
8. Recurrent stimulant use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.
9. Stimulant use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recur-
    rent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or ex-
    acerbated by the stimulant.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the stimulant to achieve intoxica-
tion or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
stimulant.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking stimulant med-
ications solely under appropriate medical supervision, such as medications for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or narcolepsy.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the stimulant (refer to Criteria A
and B of the criteria set for stimulant withdrawal).
b. The stimulant (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid
withdrawal symptoms.
**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking stimulant med-
ications solely under appropriate medical supervision, such as medications for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or narcolepsy.
Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for stimulant use disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder have been met for at least 3 months
but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for stimulant use disorder were previ-
ously met, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder have been met at any time
during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Crav-
ing, or a strong desire or urge to use the stimulant,” may be met).

Specify if:
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to stimulants is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an amphetamine
intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or another amphetamine-induced mental dis-
order is also present, do not use the codes below for amphetamine use disorder. In-
stead, the comorbid amphetamine use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the
amphetamine-induced disorder code (see the coding note for amphetamine intoxica-

tion, amphetamine withdrawal, or a specific amphetamine-induced mental disorder).
For example, if there is comorbid amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced de-
pressive disorder and amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder, only the am-
phetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the
4th character indicating whether the comorbid amphetamine-type or other stimulant
use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F15.14 for mild amphetamine-type or other
stimulant use disorder with amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive
disorder or F15.24 for a moderate or severe amphetamine-type or other stimulant use
disorder with amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder. Sim-
ilarly, if there is comorbid cocaine-induced depressive disorder and cocaine use disor-
der, only the cocaine-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character
indicating whether the comorbid cocaine use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F14.14 for mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder or
F14.24 for a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive
disorder.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.

**304.20 (F14.20)** Cocaine
**304.40 (F15.20)** Other or unspecified stimulant

Stimulant Intoxication

Acute intoxication with high doses of stimulants is associated with increased auto-
nomic activity, perceptual disturbances, behavioral changes (e.g., stereotyped behav-
iors such as picking at skin), and psychological changes (e.g., agitation, aggression).

Diagnostic Criteria for Stimulant Intoxication

A. Recent use of an amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant.
B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., eu-
phoria or affective blunting; changes in sociability; hypervigilance; interpersonal
sensitivity; anxiety, tension, or anger; stereotyped behaviors; impaired judgment)
that developed during, or shortly after, use of a stimulant.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **351**

C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms, developing during, or shortly
after, stimulant use:

1. Tachycardia or bradycardia.
2. Pupillary dilation.
3. Elevated or lowered blood pressure.
4. Perspiration or chills.
5. Nausea or vomiting.
6. Evidence of weight loss.
7. Psychomotor agitation or retardation.
8. Muscular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhyth-
    mias.
9. Confusion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance.

Specify **the specific intoxicant** (i.e., amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other
stimulant).

Specify if:
**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier may be noted when hallucinations
with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence
of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant; whether there is a co-
morbid amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder; and whether or not
there are perceptual disturbances.

For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication, without perceptu-
al disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid,
the ICD-10-CM code is F15.129, and if a moderate or severe amphetamine or other
stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.229. If there is no
comorbid amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code
is F15.929. Similarly, if a mild cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM
code is F14.129, and if a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the

Stimulant Withdrawal

The essential feature of stimulant withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic with-
drawal syndrome, which develops within a few hours after cessation of or reduction in
use of a high-dose stimulant. Use has to have been prolonged. A withdrawal syndrome
is characterized by the development of dysphoric mood accompanied by two or more
of the following physiological changes: fatigue, vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia
or hypersomnia, increased appetite, and psychomotor retardation or agitation. Acute
withdrawal symptoms (a “crash”) can be seen after periods of repetitive high-dose use.
Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or behavior can occur.

Diagnostic Criteria for Stimulant Withdrawal

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) prolonged amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or
other stimulant use.
B. Dysphoric mood and two (or more) of the following physiological changes, devel-
oping within a few hours to several days after Criterion A:

1. Fatigue.
2. Vivid, unpleasant dreams.
3. Insomnia or hypersomnia.
4. Increased appetite.
5. Psychomotor retardation or agitation.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal
from another substance.

Specify **the specific substance that causes the withdrawal syndrome** (i.e., am-
phetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant).

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.0.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant. The ICD-10-CM code for
amphetamine or an other stimulant withdrawal is **F15.23,** and the ICD-10-CM for cocaine
withdrawal is **F14.23.** Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of
a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder, reflecting
the fact that amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal can only occur in the
presence of a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder.
It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant
use disorder with amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **353**

Other Stimulant-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other stimulant-induced disorders, such as stimulant-
induced psychotic disorder, when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant in-
dependent clinical attention.
Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified stimulant-related disorder if they
have symptoms characteristic of a stimulant-related disorder that are not classifiable
as stimulant use disorder, intoxication, withdrawal, or induced disorder.

TOBACCO-RELATED DISORDERS

Tobacco Use Disorder

The relative ability of tobacco products to produce a use disorder correlates with nic-
otine content, the rapidity of absorption, and associated conditioned features (e.g.,
oral gratification). Tobacco use disorder is common among daily cigarette and smoke-
less tobacco users but is uncommon among nondaily tobacco users or among users of
nicotine medications. Tolerance to tobacco is exemplified by the disappearance of
nausea and dizziness after its use is resumed. Cessation of tobacco use can produce a
well-defined withdrawal syndrome. Many people with tobacco use disorder use to-
bacco to relieve or to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The large majority of tobacco users
report craving when they do not smoke for several hours. Spending excessive time us-
ing tobacco can be exemplified by chain-smoking. Smoking within 30 minutes of wak-
ing, smoking daily, and awaking at night to smoke are associated with tobacco use
disorder. Scientific evidence did not support the inclusion in DSM-5 of a tobacco in-
toxication disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Tobacco Use Disorder

A. A problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically significant impairment or
distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1. Tobacco is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was in-
    tended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control tobacco
use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain or use tobacco.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco.


**354** DSM-5 Guidebook

5. Recurrent tobacco use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at
    work, school, or home (e.g., interference with work).
6. Continued tobacco use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper-
    sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of tobacco (e.g., argu-
    ments with others about tobacco use).
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced
because of tobacco use.
8. Recurrent tobacco use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., smok-
    ing in bed).
9. Tobacco use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
    physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacer-
    bated by tobacco.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of tobacco to achieve the desired ef-
fect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of to-
bacco.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for tobacco (refer to Criteria A and
B of the criteria set for tobacco withdrawal).
b. Tobacco (or a closely related substance, such as nicotine) is taken to relieve
or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for tobacco use disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria for tobacco use disorder have been met for at least 3 months
but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use tobacco,” may be met).
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for tobacco use disorder were previous-
ly met, none of the criteria for tobacco use disorder have been met at any time dur-
ing a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving,
or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco,” may be met).

Specify if:
**On maintenance therapy:** The individual is taking a long-term maintenance med-
ication, such as nicotine replacement medication, and no criteria for tobacco use
disorder have been met for that class of medication (except tolerance to, or with-
drawal from, the nicotine replacement medication).
**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if the individual is
in an environment where access to tobacco is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a tobacco withdrawal
or tobacco-induced sleep disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for tobacco
use disorder. Instead, the comorbid tobacco use disorder is indicated in the 4th character
of the tobacco-induced disorder code (see the coding note for tobacco withdrawal or to-
bacco-induced sleep disorder). For example, if there is comorbid tobacco-induced sleep
disorder and tobacco use disorder, only the tobacco-induced sleep disorder code is given,
with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid tobacco use disorder is moderate
or severe: F17.208 for moderate or severe tobacco use disorder with tobacco-induced


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **355**

sleep disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder with a
tobacco-induced sleep disorder.
Specify current severity:
**305.1 (Z72.0) Mild:** Presence of 2–3 symptoms.
**305.1 (F17.200) Moderate:** Presence of 4–5 symptoms.
**305.1 (F17.200) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Tobacco Withdrawal

Tobacco withdrawal impairs the ability to stop tobacco use. The symptoms, which oc-
cur 24 hours after abstinence from tobacco, are much more intense among individuals
who smoke cigarettes. This increased intensity is probably due to the more rapid on-
set of symptoms and higher levels of nicotine with cigarette smoking.

Diagnostic Criteria for Tobacco Withdrawal **292.0 (F17.203)**

A. Daily use of tobacco for at least several weeks.
B. Abrupt cessation of tobacco use, or reduction in the amount of tobacco used, fol-
lowed within 24 hours by four (or more) of the following signs or symptoms:

1. Irritability, frustration, or anger.
2. Anxiety.
3. Difficulty concentrating.
4. Increased appetite.
5. Restlessness.
6. Depressed mood.
7. Insomnia.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The signs or symptoms are not attributed to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal
from another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for tobacco with-
drawal is F17.203. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of
a moderate or severe tobacco use disorder, reflecting the fact that tobacco withdrawal
can only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe tobacco use disorder. It is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder with tobacco withdrawal.

Other Tobacco-Induced Disorders and

Unspecified Tobacco-Related Disorder

Individuals are diagnosed with other tobacco-induced disorders, such as tobacco-
induced sleep disorder, when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant inde-
pendent clinical attention.


**356** DSM-5 Guidebook

Individuals are diagnosed with unspecified tobacco-related disorder if they have
symptoms characteristic of a tobacco-related disorder that are not classifiable as to-
bacco use disorder, withdrawal, or induced disorder.

OTHER (OR UNKNOWN) SUBSTANCE–

RELATED DISORDERS

When the substance or substances used are unknown, the individual is diagnosed with
one of the other (or unknown) substance–related disorders. In addition to diagnoses
for use disorder, intoxication, and withdrawal, two residual categories are available
for other situations: other (or unknown) substance–induced disorders and unspecified
other (or unknown) substance–related disorder.

NON-SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS

Gambling Disorder

Gambling is encountered in almost all cultures throughout recorded history. Although
most individuals gamble responsibly, some become preoccupied with gambling and
experience its multiple negative consequences. For these people, their gambling be-
havior has devastating consequences that impact the individual, his or her family,
and society.
Disordered gambling behavior was first officially recognized in DSM-III, as _path-
ological gambling._ The disorder was categorized as one of the impulse-control disor-
ders not elsewhere classified, along with disorders such as kleptomania, pyromania,
and trichotillomania. In DSM-5, the disorder has been moved to the chapter on sub-
stance use disorders because of consistently high rates of comorbidity, similar presen-
tations of some symptoms, and genetic and physiological overlap. Additionally, the
placement of gambling disorder in the current chapter is likely to improve recognition
of the disorder, especially among substance abusers, who are at high risk for gambling
problems.
The criteria have had only minor changes from DSM-IV. Importantly, the name has
changed from _pathological gambling_ to _gambling disorder,_ mainly to avoid the stigma at-
tached to the word _pathological._ Also, the number of core symptoms required for the di-
agnosis has been reduced.

Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 ( **F63.0** )

A. Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically signif-
icant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more)
of the following in a 12-month period:

1. Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the de-
    sired excitement.


**_Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders_** **357**

2. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling.
3. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling.
4. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving
    past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking
    of ways to get money with which to gamble).
5. Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, de-
    pressed).
6. After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (“chasing”
    one’s losses).
7. Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling.
8. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career
    opportunity because of gambling.
9. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused
    by gambling.
B. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode.

Specify if:
**Episodic:** Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms
subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months.
**Persistent:** Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for mul-
tiple years.

Specify if:
**In early remission:** After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but
for less than 12 months.
**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of
12 months or longer.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** 4–5 criteria met.
**Moderate:** 6–7 criteria met.
**Severe:** 8–9 criteria met.

Criterion A

The symptoms set forth mirror those of the substance addictions. Tolerance (needing
to gamble with increasing amounts of money), withdrawal (restlessness or irritability
when cutting back), and compulsive use (preoccupation with gambling, “chasing” of
losses, repeated unsuccessful attempts to control gambling, and gambling as a way of
escaping from problems) are the cardinal features of gambling disorder. The adverse
consequences of addiction are also reflected in the remaining symptoms (lying to oth-
ers, jeopardizing important relationships, and relying on others financially).
The DSM-5 diagnosis requires that four of nine symptoms be endorsed to qualify
for the diagnosis of gambling disorder. This is a change from DSM-IV, in which five
of 10 symptoms were required. DSM-IV Criterion A8 has been eliminated because the
symptom “has committed illegal acts... to finance gambling” has been shown to have

low prevalence; its elimination has little or no effect on prevalence. Also, the threshold
of four symptoms was found to differentiate pathological from nonpathological forms
of gambling.

Criterion B

Individuals with bipolar disorder may engage in multiple forms of impulsive behavior,
including gambling, when hypomanic or manic. The diagnosis of gambling disorder
requires that the gambling behavior not occur exclusively during a manic episode. It
is possible, however, that someone may have both diagnoses, with the gambling
worsening during mood instability, but this would require that the gambling behav-
ior be also independent of manic episodes.

Specifiers

Gambling disorder can be episodic or persistent, and the course of the disorder can vary
by type of gambling as well as life circumstances. For example, an individual who
wagers problematically only on football games may have gambling disorder during
football season and not wager at all, or not wager problematically, throughout the re-
mainder of the year. Gambling disorder may also occur at one or more points in an
individual’s life but be absent during other periods. Alternatively, some individuals
experience chronic gambling disorder throughout all or most of their lives.
Other specifiers, which are used for the other substance use disorders, include “in
early remission” and “in sustained remission.” Finally, a severity specifier has also
been added to differentiate mild, moderate, and severe gambling disorder on the ba-
sis of the number of criteria the individual fulfills.

KEY POINTS

- The name of the diagnostic class has been changed from “substance-related
    disorders” to “substance-related and addictive disorders” to reflect emerging con-
    cepts regarding the addictions. Ten types of substance use disorders are listed,
    as well as gambling disorder, which is classified as a non-substance-related
    disorder.
- The major change is that the categories of abuse and dependence have been
    merged, creating a single category for a “use” disorder.
- DSM-IV’s hallucinogen-related disorders and phencyclidine (or phencyclidine-
    like)–related disorders have been merged into a single category.
- The stimulant-related disorders category has replaced the categories for am-
    phetamine and cocaine use disorders. Cannabis use disorder, cannabis with-
    drawal, and caffeine withdrawal are new. Nicotine-related disorders are now
    called tobacco-related disorders.
- Gambling disorder (formerly DSM-IV pathological gambling) has been moved
    to this chapter, reflecting emerging concepts regarding the addictions.
