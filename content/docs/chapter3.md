This chapter is a reformulation of the DSM-IV chapter “Disor-
ders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.” The category
was first included in DSM-III, which brought together intellectual disorders (under
the rubric “mental retardation”), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct
disorder, anxiety disorders of childhood, eating disorders, stereotypic movement dis-
orders, and several other disorders. This represented an advance over the earlier edi-
tions, in which intellectual disorders were recognized but other childhood-onset
disorders received little attention. In DSM-I, childhood disorders were subsumed
within the categories mental deficiency, transient situational personality disturbances,
adjustment reaction of infancy, adjustment reaction of adolescence, and adjustment
reaction of childhood. The latter included such conditions as habit disturbances (i.e.,
nail biting, thumb sucking, enuresis, masturbation, tantrums, tics, habit spasms, som-
nambulism, overactivity, and phobias).
The term _mental retardation_ was introduced in DSM-II (American Psychiatric As-
sociation 1968) to replace _mental deficiency_ , and the category was expanded to include
the variety of physical, infectious, and other causes of retardation. The category “be-
havior disorders of childhood and adolescence” was introduced to group together
disorders “occurring in childhood and adolescence that are more stable, internalized,
and resistant to treatment than _Transient situational disturbances_ but less so than the
_Psychoses, Neuroses,_ and _Personality disorders_ ” (pp. 49–50). Included were hyperkinetic
reaction, withdrawing reaction, overanxious reaction, runaway reaction, unsocial-
ized aggressive reaction, and group delinquent reaction.
The authors of DSM-III brought together the intellectual, behavioral, emotional,
physical, and developmental disorders that have their origins in infancy, childhood,
or adolescence. An important contribution was the introduction of the _pervasive devel-
opmental disorders,_ whose most prominent example was infantile autism and which
had been recognized in one form or another for decades but never formally classified.
Also new was the multiaxial system, in which mental retardation was coded on Axis
II. As discussed in Chapter 2, “Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV,” the
multiaxial system has been omitted from DSM-5. DSM-III-R and DSM-IV made fur-
ther changes (e.g., creating a new chapter for eating disorders), but the category of
early developing disorders remained largely unchanged.


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **31**

Several major changes are highlighted in this chapter. First, its placement as the first
class in DSM-5 is a reflection of the manual’s metastructure and its emphasis on the de-
velopmental trajectory of disorders. Second, the term _mental retardation_ has been re-
placed by _intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)._ The revised diagnosis
will capture those individuals formerly diagnosed with mental retardation, but there is
no longer a reliance on IQ as the determinant for inclusion in the category. Instead, sub-
types are used to classify the individual as having a mild, moderate, severe, or pro-
found level of severity. The Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group considered
the term _mental retardation_ to be stigmatizing and no longer helpful. Further, the term
_intellectual disability_ reflects wording adopted into U.S. law in 2010 (Rosa’s Law), and
the term is used in professional journals and has been endorsed by some patient advo-
cacy groups. The term _intellectual developmental disorder_ is consistent with language pro-
posed for ICD-11. Another concern expressed by the work group was the arbitrary
reliance on IQ as the defining feature of intellectual disability, because it does not take
into account the different domains of functioning (social, conceptual/intellectual, prac-
tical) that allow a more nuanced view of the person with an intellectual deficit.
Another major change in DSM-5 was the decision to create an omnibus category,
autism spectrum disorder, that consolidates the DSM-IV categories autistic disorder,
Rett’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive
developmental disorder not otherwise specified. The change was prompted by re-
search showing that the disorders were not as discrete and independent as once be-
lieved, and that clinicians had difficulty distinguishing them. All persons formerly
included in each of these disorders should fit the new category, and its subtleties
should be adequately captured by severity specifiers. This change has been criticized
by clinicians, their patients, and the patients’ parents. Parents expressed concern that
the revised categories might leave their child unable to qualify for educational or
other benefits, whereas individuals with Asperger’s disorder who had developed a
sense of identity felt disenfranchised.
Other changes to the class include moving oppositional defiant disorder and con-
duct disorder to the chapter “Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders.”
Elimination disorders (encopresis and enuresis) now have their own chapter, and the
feeding disorders (pica, rumination disorder, and feeding disorder of infancy or early
childhood) have been combined with the eating disorders for a more comprehensive
chapter on disturbed eating behaviors. Separation anxiety disorder and selective
mutism have been moved to the “Anxiety Disorders” chapter. Reactive attachment
disorder has been moved to the “Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders” chapter
because of its clear relationship with social neglect.
The communication disorders include language disorder, speech sound disorder,
childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), and social (pragmatic) communication
disorder. The term _learning disorder_ has been changed to _specific learning disorder,_ and
the previous types of learning disorders (reading disorder, mathematics disorder, and
disorder of written expression) are no longer included. They are now presented as a
single disorder with coded specifiers for deficits in reading, writing, and mathemat-
ics. Finally, other specified and unspecified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
diagnoses have been added (Table 3–1).

INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES

Intellectual Disability (Intellectual

Developmental Disorder)

The essential features of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)
are deficits in general mental abilities (Criterion A) and impairment in everyday
adaptive functioning in comparison to the individual’s age-, gender-, and sociocultur-
ally matched peers (Criterion B), with onset in the developmental period (Criterion C).


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **33**

Individuals with intellectual developmental disorder may also have difficulties in
managing their behavior and emotions, in interpersonal relationships, and in main-
taining motivation in the learning process.
The diagnosis is based on both clinical assessment and standardized testing of in-
telligence. _Intelligence_ has been defined as a general mental ability that involves rea-
soning, problem solving, planning, thinking abstractly, comprehending complex
ideas, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, as applied in aca-
demic learning and social understanding, as well as practical understanding and ma-
nipulation of objects. IQ is typically measured using standardized tests. With such
tests, the category of intellectual disorder is considered to be about two standard de-
viations or more below the population mean, including a margin for measurement er-
ror (generally +5 points). On tests with a standard deviation of 15 and a mean of 100,
this involves a score of 65–75. Clinical training and judgment are needed to interpret
test results and assess intellectual performance. Factors other than intellectual devel-
opmental disorders, such as associated cultural background, native language, and
communication disorders, may limit performance.
Intellectual developmental disorders are common (about 1%–2% of the general
population), more so in boys than girls. These disorders almost certainly result from
a final common pathway produced by a variety of factors that injure the brain and af-
fect its normal development. Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal
cause of mental retardation, whereas fragile X syndrome is probably the most com-
mon heritable form of intellectual disability. Inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., Tay-
Sachs disease) account for a small percentage of cases. Other factors include maternal
malnutrition or substance abuse; exposure to mutagens such as radiation; maternal
illnesses such as diabetes, toxemia, or rubella; and maternal abuse and neglect. Peri-
natal and early postnatal factors also may contribute, such as traumatic deliveries that
cause brain injury or malnutrition during infancy or early childhood.
Several important changes have been made to this category in DSM-5. The name
was changed to _intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)_ from _mental re-
tardation_ , a term that is no longer used internationally or in U.S. federal legislation.
The name _intellectual developmental disorder_ was chosen to be consistent with DSM-5
as a classification of _disorders_ and to harmonize this diagnosis with the proposed ICD-

11. In DSM-5, IQ test scores and standard deviations from the mean on those tests,
which were included in the diagnostic criteria for mental retardation in DSM-IV, have
been moved to the body of the text and are not contained within the criteria. How-
ever, DSM-5 continues to specify that standardized psychological testing must be in-
cluded in the assessment of persons with these disorders, consistent with the
American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) defini-
tion, but that psychological testing should accompany clinical assessment. With the
elimination of the multiaxial classification in DSM-5, intellectual developmental dis-
order is no longer relegated to Axis II. Removing IQ ranges from the criteria means
that IQ can no longer be used inappropriately to define a person’s overall ability. Cog-
nitive profiles are generally more useful than a single Full Scale IQ score for describing
intellectual abilities, and clinical training and judgment are required for interpreta-
tion of test results.


**34** DSM-5 Guidebook

Both AAIDD and DSM-5 define _intellectual functioning_ as a general mental ability
that involves reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, comprehension
of complex ideas, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience. In
DSM-5, the definition is applied to reasoning in three contexts: academic learning
(conceptual domain), social understanding (social domain), and practical understand-
ing (practical domain). A wide range of skills are contained within the three domains
of adaptive behavior. The conceptual domain involves skills used to solve problems in
language, reading, writing, math, reasoning, knowledge, and memory, among others.
The social domain involves awareness of others’ experiences, empathy, interpersonal
communication skills, friendship abilities, social judgment, and self-regulation. The
practical domain involves self-management across life settings, including personal
care, job responsibilities, money management, recreation, managing one’s behavior,
and organizing school and work tasks.
With the inclusion of severity levels (mild, moderate, severe, profound) in DSM-5,
the focus is on adaptive functioning rather than IQ. Adaptive functioning deficits are
now required. _Adaptive functioning_ refers to how well an individual copes with the
common tasks of everyday life in three general domains (i.e., conceptual, social, and
practical), and how well an individual meets the standards of personal independence
and social responsibility expected for someone of a similar age, sociocultural back-
ground, and community setting in one or more aspects of daily life activities, such as
communication, social participation, functioning at school or work, or personal inde-
pendence at home or in community settings. For an individual with intellectual dis-
ability (intellectual developmental disorder), adaptive behavior limitations result in
the need for ongoing support in school, work, or independent life.

Diagnostic Criteria for Intellectual Disability
(Intellectual Developmental Disorder)

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is a disorder with onset during
the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits
in conceptual, social, and practical domains. The following three criteria must be met:

A. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract
thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by
both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing.

B. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and so-
ciocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without
ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of
daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across
multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.

C. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.

**Note:** The diagnostic term intellectual disability is the equivalent term for the ICD-11
diagnosis of intellectual developmental disorders. Although the term intellectual dis-
ability is used throughout this manual, both terms are used in the title to clarify rela-
tionships with other classification systems. Moreover, a federal statute in the United


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **35**

S t a t e s ( Pu b l i c L a w 111-256, Rosa’s Law) replaces the term mental retardation with
intellectual disability, and research journals use the term intellectual disability. Thus,
intellectual disability is the term in common use by medical, educational, and other
professions and by the lay public and advocacy groups.

Specify current severity (see Table 1 in DSM-5, pp. 34–36):
**317 (F70) Mild
318.0 (F71) Moderate
318.1 (F72) Severe
318.2 (F73) Profound**

Criteria A and B

Deficits in intellectual functions and impairment in adaptive functioning are both re-
quired in order for the diagnosis. For example, intellectual developmental disorder
would not be recognized in an individual with an IQ score lower than 70 in the absence
of significant deficits in adaptive functioning. The person must also have significant im-
pairment in adaptive functioning (i.e., how well the person copes with the common
tasks of everyday life and meets the standards of personal independence in social re-
sponsibility expected for someone of a similar age, sociocultural background, and com-
munity setting). Adaptive behavior reflects performance in academic, social, and
practical settings in spite of intellectual ability, education, motivation, personality fea-
tures, social and vocational opportunity, and coexisting medical conditions or mental
disorders. When adaptive functioning is impaired, performance is limited and partici-
pation is restricted in one or more aspects of daily life activities, such as communication,
social participation, and independent living, at home or in community settings.

Criterion C

_Onset during the developmental period_ refers to recognition and diagnosis before adoles-
cence.

Global Developmental Delay

Global developmental delay is a new diagnosis and allows the clinician to note cases
in which evidence clearly indicates significant intellectual or general developmental
delay or disability, but clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed. The diagno-
sis is reserved for individuals under the age of 5 years.

Global Developmental Delay **315.8 (F88)**

This diagnosis is reserved for individuals under the age of 5 years when the clinical
severity level cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood. This category is di-
agnosed when an individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in sev-


**36** DSM-5 Guidebook

eral areas of intellectual functioning, and applies to individuals who are unable to
undergo systematic assessments of intellectual functioning, including children who
are too young to participate in standardized testing. This category requires reassess-
ment after a period of time.

Unspecified Intellectual Disability

(Intellectual Developmental Disorder)

The diagnosis unspecified intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disor-
der) is used in persons over age 5 years who have significant intellectual or general
developmental delay or disability and who cannot be reliably assessed.

Unspecified Intellectual Disability
(Intellectual Disability Disorder) **319 (F79)**

This category is reserved for individuals over the age of 5 years when assessment of
the degree of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) by means of lo-
cally available procedures is rendered difficult or impossible because of associated
sensory or physical impairments, as in blindness or prelingual deafness; locomotor dis-
ability; or presence of severe problem behaviors or co-occurring mental disorder. This
category should only be used in exceptional circumstances and requires reassessment
after a period of time.

COMMUNICATION DISORDERS

The communication disorders are characterized by difficulties in language, speech, and
communication. While not traditionally considered mental disorders, they can cause
distress and impair functioning in important life domains and are important for pur-
poses of differential diagnosis. The communication disorders include language disor-
der (which combines the DSM-IV categories expressive and mixed receptive-expressive
language disorders), speech sound disorder (previously phonological disorder), and
childhood-onset fluency disorder (previously stuttering). Social (pragmatic) communi-
cation disorder is a newly defined condition involving persistent difficulties in the so-
cial uses of verbal and nonverbal communication. DSM-IV l _earning disorder_ has been
changed to _specific learning disorder,_ and the previous types of learning disorders (read-
ing disorder, mathematics disorder, and disorder of written expression) are no longer
included. Instead, specifiers are used to describe the individual’s impairment.

Language Disorder

The essential feature of language disorder is a persistent disturbance in the acquisi-
tion and use of spoken language, written language, or sign language that is due to


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **37**

deficits in comprehension or production (Criterion A). Language abilities are sub-
stantially and quantifiably below those expected for age, significantly interfering
with socialization, effective communication, academic achievement, or occupational
performance (Criterion B). Regional variations in language (e.g., dialects) do not con-
stitute a language disorder. Symptom onset is in the early developmental period (Cri-
terion C). Other disorders (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental
disorder], hearing impairment, motor dysfunction) must be ruled out as a cause of the
language difficulties (Criterion D).

Diagnostic Criteria for Language Disorder **315.32 (F80.2)**

A. Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across modalities (i.e.,
spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to deficits in comprehension or pro-
duction that include the following:

1. Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use).
2. Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word endings together to form
    sentences based on the rules of grammar and morphology).
3. Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and connect sentences to ex-
    plain or describe a topic or series of events or have a conversation).

B. Language abilities are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for age,
resulting in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation,
academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any com-
bination.

C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.

D. The difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory impairment, motor
dysfunction, or another medical or neurological condition and are not better ex-
plained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global de-
velopmental delay.

Speech Sound Disorder

Speech sound disorder is characterized by persistent difficulties in speech production
that are developmentally inappropriate and involve articulation, fluency, and voice
production in its various aspects. This disorder often coexists with language disorder,
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and neurological condi-
tions such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome.

Diagnostic Criteria for Speech Sound Disorder **315.39 (F80.0)**

A. Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with speech intel-
ligibility or prevents verbal communication of messages.

B. The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that interfere with


**38** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individ-
ually or in any combination.
```
C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.

D. The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired conditions, such as ce-
rebral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, or other
medical or neurological conditions.

Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)

Childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering) is characterized by a disturbance in the
normal fluency and time patterning of speech that is inappropriate for age. The dis-
turbance can manifest as frequent repetitions or prolongations of sounds or syllables
or other types of speech dysfluencies, such as sound and syllable repetitions, broken
words (e.g., pauses within a word), audible or silent blocking (e.g., filled or unfilled
pauses in speech), or circumlocutions (e.g., word substitutions to avoid problematic
words). The disturbance interferes with academic or occupational achievement or
with social communication. Stuttering can also cause humiliation and embarrass-
ment and lead individuals to avoid situations that may be associated with speech,
such as using a telephone. The disorder usually occurs by age 6 years, although most
recover from the dysfluency. Stress and anxiety can exacerbate the disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Childhood-Onset
Fluency Disorder (Stuttering **) 315.35 (F80.81)**

A. Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that are inappro-
priate for the individual’s age and language skills, persist over time, and are char-
acterized by frequent and marked occurrences of one (or more) of the following: 

1. Sound and syllable repetitions.
2. Sound prolongations of consonants as well as vowels.
3. Broken words (e.g., pauses within a word).
4. Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech).
5. Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic words).
6. Words produced with an excess of physical tension.
7. Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., “I-I-I-I see him”).

B. The disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in effective commu-
nication, social participation, or academic or occupational performance, individu-
ally or in any combination.

C. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period. ( **Note:** Later-onset
cases are diagnosed as 307.0 [F98.5] adult-onset fluency disorder.)

D. The disturbance is not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory deficit, dysfluency
associated with neurological insult (e.g., stroke, tumor, trauma), or another medical
condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder.


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **39**

Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder

Social (pragmatic) communication disorder is new to DSM-5. This is a disorder of
children who have difficulty with the pragmatic aspects of social communication, in-
cluding comprehension, formulation, and discourse comprehension, affecting idi-
omatic and nonliteral language inferences in narrative texts and conversation (Bishop
2000). This disorder is unexpected given a child’s relatively intact vocabulary and sen-
tence abilities. Research suggests that such children exhibit socially inappropriate be-
havior but do not have autism spectrum disorder (Bishop and Norbury 2002). Thus,
the pragmatic difficulties they experience constitute a fundamentally different form
of language impairment. Children with this condition display common difficulties in
social communication but not repetitive behaviors or restricted interests consistent
with autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder needs to be ruled out, as
do attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, social anxiety disorder, and intellectual
disability (intellectual developmental disorder).

Diagnostic Criteria for Social (Pragmatic)
Communication Disorder **315.39 (F80.89)**

A. Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication as
manifested by all of the following:

1. Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as greeting and shar-
    ing information, in a manner that is appropriate for the social context.
2. Impairment of the ability to change communication to match context or the
    needs of the listener, such as speaking differently in a classroom than on a
    playground, talking differently to a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of
    overly formal language.
3. Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling, such as taking turns
    in conversation, rephrasing when misunderstood, and knowing how to use ver-
    bal and nonverbal signals to regulate interaction.
4. Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g., making inferences)
    and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., idioms, humor, met-
    aphors, multiple meanings that depend on the context for interpretation).

B. The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication, social partic-
ipation, social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance,
individually or in combination.

C. The onset of the symptoms is in the early developmental period (but deficits may
not become fully manifest until social communication demands exceed limited ca-
pacities).

D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or
to low abilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, and are not better
explained by autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual develop-
mental disorder), global developmental delay, or another mental disorder.


**40** DSM-5 Guidebook

Unspecified Communication Disorder

**Unspecified Communication Disorder 307.9 (F80.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of communi-
cation disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for communication disorder or for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental
disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified communication disorder category is used
in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria
are not met for communication disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder,
and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis.

AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER

Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism was described by Leo Kanner (1948) as a syndrome of social communication
deficits combined with repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and as having an onset
in early childhood. In DSM-III, the disorder was called “infantile autism” and was listed
as one of several pervasive developmental disorders. In DSM-III-R and DSM-IV,
other related disorders were included in the category, including Rett’s disorder, child-
hood disintegrative disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive developmental dis-
order not otherwise specified. DSM-5 now replaces all of these diagnoses with a
single diagnosis, autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder is considered
a neurodevelopmental disorder. Although present from infancy or early childhood, the
disorder may not be detected until later because of minimal social demands and sup-
port from parents or caregivers in early years.
For DSM-5, the diagnosis has been reconceptualized as a “spectrum” that includes
all of the various disorders previously distinguished in DSM-IV. The essential fea-
tures of autism spectrum disorder are persistent deficits in reciprocal social commu-
nication, in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and in
developing, managing, and understanding relationships (Criterion A) and restricted,
repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). Distinctions
among the pervasive developmental disorders were inconsistent over time, variable
across sites, and often associated with severity, language level, or intelligence rather
than features of the disorder. The Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group con-
sidered various options and concluded that because autism is defined by a common
set of behaviors, it is best represented as a single diagnostic category adapted to the
individual’s clinical presentation by inclusion of clinical specifiers (e.g., severity, in-


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **41**

tellectual impairment, language impairment) and associated features (e.g., known ge-
netic disorders, epilepsy, intellectual disability). For example, an individual formerly
diagnosed with Asperger ’s disorder can now be diagnosed with autism spectrum
disorder, without intellectual impairment and without accompanying structural lan-
guage impairment.
The work group made other changes to the category. The three domains in DSM-
IV (social interaction, communication, repetitive/stereotyped behaviors) have be-
come two: 1) social-communication and social-interactive deficits and 2) restricted,
repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities. Research shows that deficits in commu-
nication and social behaviors are inseparable and best considered as a single set of
symptoms with contextual and environmental specificities. Also, delays in language
acquisition are neither unique nor universal, and are more accurately considered as a
factor that influences the clinical symptoms of autism spectrum disorder rather than
as a feature that defines the diagnosis. Requiring that both criteria be met improves
specificity of diagnosis without impairing sensitivity.

Diagnostic Criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder **299.00 (F84.0)**

A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple
contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are il-
lustrative, not exhaustive; see DSM-5 text):

1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal
    social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced
    sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social
    interactions.
2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction,
    ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communica-
    tion; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in under-
    standing and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal
    communication.
3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, ranging,
    for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts;
    to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of in-
    terest in peers.
Specify current severity:
    **Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted,**
    **repetitive patterns of behavior** (see Table 2 in DSM-5, p. 52).

B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by
at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not
exhaustive; see DSM-5 text):

1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g., sim-
    ple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic
    phrases).

2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns
    of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, diffi-
    culties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take
    same route or eat same food every day).
3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g.,
    strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively cir-
    cumscribed or perseverative interests).
4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects
    of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse
    response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of ob-
    jects, visual fascination with lights or movement).
Specify current severity:
    **Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted,**
    **repetitive patterns of behavior** (see Table 2 in DSM-5, p. 52).

C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not be-
come fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be
masked by learned strategies in later life).

D. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of current functioning.

E. These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and
autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of au-
tism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be
below that expected for general developmental level.
**Note:** Individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, As-
perger’s disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified should
be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals who have marked def-
icits in social communication, but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for
autism spectrum disorder, should be evaluated for social (pragmatic) communication
disorder.

Criterion A

The essential feature of autism spectrum disorder is persistent impairment in recip-
rocal social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts. This
symptom is pervasive and sustained. Manifestations depend in part on age, intellec-
tual level, and language ability, as well as on individual differences in personality and
other factors, such as treatment history and current support. For many with this dis-
order, language will be affected (e.g., speech may be absent or its onset delayed).
Communication may be impaired even when formal skills, including vocabulary and
grammar, are intact. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity are clearly evident, and
young children with the disorder may show little or no initiation of social interaction
and no sharing of emotions. An early feature is poor or absent eye contact.

Criterion B

This criterion requires the child to have restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, in-
terests, or activities. For example, the child may prefer rigid routines and insist that
things be done in the same way. The child may have a narrow and intense focus on
particular topics, such as train schedules. The child may exhibit stereotyped or repet-
itive behaviors, such as hand flapping or finger flicking. Excessive adherence to rou-
tines and restricted patterns of behavior may be manifested as resistance to change or
ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior, such as repetitive questioning.
Highly restricted, fixated interests tend to be abnormal in intensity and/or focus (e.g.,
preoccupation with vacuum cleaners). Interests and routines may relate to high or
low levels of reactivity to sensory input, as shown by extreme responses to specific
sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights
or spinning objects, and sometimes apparent indifference to pain, heat, or cold.

Criteria C, D, and E

Symptoms begin early in life and limit or cause impairments in social, occupational,
or other critical areas of functioning. The stage at which functional impairment be-
comes apparent varies by individual and his or her environment. Core diagnostic fea-
tures are evident in the developmental period, but intervention, compensation, and
current supports may mask difficulties at later stages of the disorder.
Autism spectrum disorder needs to be differentiated from intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) and global developmental delay, because the
latter conditions can be associated with communication difficulties. The distinction may
be particularly difficult in young children. The determination may rest on whether
the communication and interaction are significantly impaired relative to the develop-
mental level of the individual’s nonverbal skills, in which case the diagnosis of autism
spectrum disorder is likely.
Children with an autism spectrum disorder may have relatively obvious prob-
lems early in life. Within the first 3–6 months, parents may note that their child does
not develop a normal pattern of smiling or responding to cuddling. The first clear
sign of abnormality is usually in the area of language. As the child grows older, he or


**44** DSM-5 Guidebook

she does not progress through developmental milestones, such as learning to say
words and speak sentences, and seems aloof, withdrawn, and detached. Instead of
developing patterns of relating warmly to his or her parents, the child may instead
engage in self-stimulating behavior, such as rocking or head banging. Eventually, it
becomes clear that something is severely wrong, and the features of the disorder con-
tinue to become more apparent over time as these children fail to develop normal ver-
bal and interpersonal communication.
In young children, lack of social and communication abilities may hamper learn-
ing, especially that associated with social interactions. In the home, insistence on rou-
tines and aversion to change, as well as sensory sensitivities, may interfere with eating
and sleeping and make routine care (e.g., haircuts, dental appointments) extremely
difficult. In adulthood, rigidity and difficulty with novelty may limit independence
even in highly intelligent people with autism spectrum disorder.

ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was first acknowledged in DSM-II
as a hyperkinetic reaction of childhood (or adolescence), characterized by overactiv-
ity, restlessness, distractibility, and short attention span. DSM-III provided opera-
tional diagnostic criteria and emphasized deficits in attention, impulsivity, and
hyperactivity, but included a category for those without hyperactivity. In DSM-IV, the
criteria were revised to focus on two broad groups of symptoms: 1) difficulty focusing
and maintaining attention and 2) hyperactivity and impulsivity. The criteria required
that at least 12 of 18 symptoms (6 from the domain of attention and 6 from the domain
of hyperactivity-impulsivity) be present for at least 6 months, with onset before age 7
years. Subtypes could be used to specify whether the presentation was predominantly
inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, or mixed. Several changes have
been made to the diagnosis in DSM-5. First, age at onset has been changed from onset
of impairing symptoms by age 7 to onset of symptoms by age 12. Research has shown
that estimates of onset by age 7 years are unreliable and that few clinical differences
exist between children identified as having onset by age 7 versus those with later on-
set in terms of course, severity, outcome, or treatment response (Applegate et al. 1997).
Subtypes have been replaced with presentation specifiers that map directly to the
prior subtypes. Examples used in the criterion items have been changed to accommo-
date a life span relevance of each symptom and to improve clarity (Matte et al. 2012).
Symptom threshold for adults age 17 years or older was reduced to five (from six for
those younger than 17 years) both for inattention and for hyperactivity and impulsiv-
ity. The change was prompted by research showing that individuals tend to have
fewer symptoms of ADHD in adulthood than in childhood. Finally, in response to
data showing that ADHD and autism spectrum disorder can coexist, a comorbid di-
agnosis with autism spectrum disorder is now allowed. This change brings the
ADHD criteria into harmony with the revised criteria for autism spectrum disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

A. A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes
with functioning or development, as characterized by (1) and/or (2):

1. **Inattention:** Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least
    6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that
    negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities:
    **Note:** The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior,
    defiance, hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older ado-
    lescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.
    a. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in
       schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or misses de-
       tails, work is inaccurate).
    b. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (e.g., has dif-
       ficulty remaining focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading).
    c. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g., mind seems
       elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious distraction).
    d. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork,
       chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus
       and is easily sidetracked).
    e. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty manag-
       ing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and belongings in order;
       messy, disorganized work; has poor time management; fails to meet dead-
       lines).
    f. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sus-
       tained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents
       and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers).
    g. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials,
       pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile tele-
       phones).
    h. Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older adolescents and
       adults, may include unrelated thoughts).
    i. Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands; for older
       adolescents and adults, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).
2. **Hyperactivity and impulsivity:** Six (or more) of the following symptoms have
    persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with develop-
    mental level and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occu-
    pational activities:
    **Note:** The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, de-
    fiance, hostility, or a failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older adoles-
    cents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.
    a. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat.
    b. Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g.,
       leaves his or her place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or
       in other situations that require remaining in place).


**46** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
c. Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate. ( Note: In
adolescents or adults, may be limited to feeling restless.)
d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly.
e. Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g., is unable to be or
uncomfortable being still for extended time, as in restaurants, meetings;
may be experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with).
f. Often talks excessively.
g. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g.,
completes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation).
h. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in line).
i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games,
or activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or receiv-
ing permission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude into or take over
what others are doing).
```
B. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age
12 years.

C. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more
settings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).

D. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of,
social, academic, or occupational functioning.

E. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or an-
other psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder,
substance intoxication or withdrawal).
Specify whether:
**314.01 (F90.2) Combined presentation:** If both Criterion A1 (inattention) and Cri-
terion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) are met for the past 6 months.
**314.00 (F90.0) Predominantly inattentive presentation:** If Criterion A1 (inattention)
is met but Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is not met for the past 6 months.
**314.01 (F90.1) Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation:** If Criterion
A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is met and Criterion A1 (inattention) is not met for the
past 6 months.
Specify if:
**In partial remission:** When full criteria were previously met, fewer than the full cri-
teria have been met for the past 6 months, and the symptoms still result in impair-
ment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are
present, and symptoms result in no more than minor impairments in social or oc-
cupational functioning.
**Moderate:** Symptoms or functional impairment between “mild” and “severe” are
present.
**Severe:** Many symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, or
several symptoms that are particularly severe, are present, or the symptoms result
in marked impairment in social or occupational functioning.


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **47**

Criterion A

The essential feature of ADHD is a persistent pattern of inattention (Criterion A1)
and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity (Criterion A2) sufficiently severe that it interferes
with functioning or development. _Inattention_ refers to problems with the following:
staying on task, being persistent, focusing, being organized, planning, and following
through. _Hyperactivity_ is manifested as excessive motor activity, such as running
about or climbing, or excessive fidgeting, tapping, or squirming, in situations where
it is not appropriate. Hyperactivity may not be continuous, but overactivity may occur
very frequently.

Criterion B

This item requires that several symptoms of ADHD have an onset before age 12 years
because it is difficult to reliably establish precise childhood onset retrospectively (Kiel-
ing et al. 2010). For adolescents or young adults, a longitudinal perspective should in-
dicate that the condition had its roots during childhood and is not of recent onset.

Criterion C

This item requires that several symptoms of ADHD appear in two or more settings.
Although potentially costly and time consuming, and while not a requirement for di-
agnosis, the text recommends consulting informants (e.g., parents, teachers, employ-
ers) who have seen the individual across various settings. For children, teacher rating
scales can provide valuable and adjunctive information as to expectations for norma-
tive patterns of behavior.

Criterion D

In children, ADHD can impair school performance. In adults, worse occupational
performance and attendance, higher probability of unemployment, interpersonal
conflict, and reduced self-esteem are common. Children with ADHD are about twice
as likely as children without a disorder to experience an injury requiring medical at-
tention, presumably due to their impulsivity and inattention. Inadequate self-appli-
cation to tasks that require sustained effort is often interpreted by others as laziness,
a poor sense of responsibility, and oppositional behavior. Family relationships are of-
ten characterized by resentment and antagonism, especially because variability in the
person’s symptomatic status often leads others to believe that the troublesome behav-
ior is willful.

Criterion E

Other mental disorders need to be ruled out as a cause for the symptoms. ADHD
shares symptoms of inattention with both anxiety disorders and major depression. In-
dividuals with ADHD are inattentive due to daydreaming or their attraction to exter-
nal stimuli or new activities. ADHD should be readily distinguished from the
inattention due to worry, rumination, and internal stimuli seen with anxiety disorders


**48** DSM-5 Guidebook

or major depression. Young people with bipolar disorder may have increased activity,
but the activity is episodic, varying with mood and goal-directed behavior. ADHD
should not be confused with mania. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is char-
acterized by consistent moodiness, irritability, and intolerance of frustration, but im-
pulsivity and disorganized attention are not part of the condition.
In some adults, distinguishing ADHD from various personality disorders (e.g.,
antisocial, borderline, narcissistic) may be difficult. These disorders tend to share the
features of disorganization, social intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and cogni-
tive dysregulation. However, ADHD is not characterized by fears of abandonment,
self-injury, extreme ambivalence, or other features of severe personality disorders.
Lastly, ADHD is not diagnosed if the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity oc-
cur exclusively during the course of a psychotic disorder.

Other Specified Attention-Deficit/

Hyperactivity Disorder and Unspecified

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

Other specified ADHD and unspecified ADHD are residual categories for those pre-
sentations of ADHD that do not fit within the more specific diagnostic category.

Other Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder **314.01 (F90.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the disorders
in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other specified attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any specific neurodevelopmental
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “with insufficient inattention symptoms”).

Unspecified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder **314.01 (F90.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the disorders
in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified attention-defi-


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **49**

cit/hyperactivity disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

SPECIFIC LEARNING DISORDER

Specific Learning Disorder

Specific learning disorder is characterized by persistent difficulties in learning and us-
ing academic skills, with onset during the developmental period. Specific learning
disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a synthesis of the person’s medical, develop-
mental, educational, and family history; the history of the learning difficulty and its
manifestation; the impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning; observa-
tions as the person reads or solves age- or grade-level material; school reports; and
scores from individual standardized educational or neuropsychological testing. This
diagnosis replaces reading disorder, mathematics disorder, and disorder of written ex-
pression. Instead, these disorders are now included in a single diagnosis with coded
specifiers for impairments in reading, written expression, and mathematics. The rea-
son for the change was widespread concern among clinicians and researchers that
DSM-IV’s three independent learning disorders lacked validity. This change is partic-
ularly important given that most children with a specific learning disorder manifest
deficits in more than one area. With the reclassification of these conditions as a single
disorder, separate specifiers can be used to code the specific deficits present in each of
the three areas as well as current severity. Specific types of reading disorders are
widely described as _dyslexia_ , while specific types of mathematics deficits are described
as _dyscalculia_.
The essential feature is a persistent problem in learning or using academic skills
as quickly or as accurately as peers during the developmental period (Criterion A).
Thus, the individual’s academic skills are well below the average range for his or her
age, gender-based peers, and cultural group (Criterion B). The clinical expression of
the specific learning difficulties occurs during the school-age years, and therefore
these difficulties may not be apparent until demands on the affected skills exceed the
individual’s abilities (Criterion C). The learning difficulties cannot be accounted for
by intellectual difficulties, uncorrected visual or auditory problems, psychosocial ad-
versity, poor proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inadequate edu-
cational instruction (Criterion D).

Diagnostic Criteria for Specific Learning Disorder

A. Difficulties learning and using academic skills, as indicated by the presence of at
least one of the following symptoms that have persisted for at least 6 months, de-
spite the provision of interventions that target those difficulties:


**50** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. Inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading (e.g., reads single words aloud
    incorrectly or slowly and hesitantly, frequently guesses words, has difficulty
    sounding out words).
2. Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g., may read text accu-
    rately but not understand the sequence, relationships, inferences, or deeper
    meanings of what is read).
3. Difficulties with spelling (e.g., may add, omit, or substitute vowels or conso-
    nants).
4. Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple grammatical or punc-
    tuation errors within sentences; employs poor paragraph organization; written
    expression of ideas lacks clarity).
5. Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation (e.g., has
    poor understanding of numbers, their magnitude, and relationships; counts
    on fingers to add single-digit numbers instead of recalling the math fact as
    peers do; gets lost in the midst of arithmetic computation and may switch pro-
    cedures).
6. Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g., has severe difficulty applying
    mathematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve quantitative problems).
B. The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those ex-
pected for the individual’s chronological age, and cause significant interference
with academic or occupational performance, or with activities of daily living, as
confirmed by individually administered standardized achievement measures and
comprehensive clinical assessment. For individuals age 17 years and older, a doc-
umented history of impairing learning difficulties may be substituted for the stan-
dardized assessment.
C. The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not become fully
manifest until the demands for those affected academic skills exceed the individ-
ual’s limited capacities (e.g., as in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy complex
reports for a tight deadline, excessively heavy academic loads).
D. The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities, un-
corrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological disorders, psycho-
social adversity, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or
inadequate educational instruction.
**Note:** The four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on a clinical synthesis of the
individual’s history (developmental, medical, family, educational), school reports, and
psychoeducational assessment.

**Coding note:** Specify all academic domains and subskills that are impaired. When
more than one domain is impaired, each one should be coded individually according
to the following specifiers.
Specify if:
**315.00 (F81.0) With impairment in reading:**
Word reading accuracy
Reading rate or fluency
Reading comprehension
**Note:** Dyslexia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of learning diffi-
culties characterized by problems with accurate or fluent word recognition,
poor decoding, and poor spelling abilities. If dyslexia is used to specify this par-

ticular pattern of difficulties, it is important also to specify any additional difficul-
ties that are present, such as difficulties with reading comprehension or math
reasoning.
315.2 (F81.81) With impairment in written expression:
Spelling accuracy
Grammar and punctuation accuracy
Clarity or organization of written expression
315.1 (F81.2) With impairment in mathematics:
Number sense
Memorization of arithmetic facts
Accurate or fluent calculation
Accurate math reasoning
Note: Dyscalculia is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of difficulties
characterized by problems processing numerical information, learning arithme-
tic facts, and performing accurate or fluent calculations. If dyscalculia is used to
specify this particular pattern of mathematic difficulties, it is important also to
specify any additional difficulties that are present, such as difficulties with math
reasoning or word reasoning accuracy.
```
Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Some difficulties learning skills in one or two academic domains, but of mild
enough severity that the individual may be able to compensate or function well
when provided with appropriate accommodations or support services, especially
during the school years.
**Moderate:** Marked difficulties learning skills in one or more academic domains, so
that the individual is unlikely to become proficient without some intervals of inten-
sive and specialized teaching during the school years. Some accommodations or
supportive services at least part of the day at school, in the workplace, or at home
may be needed to complete activities accurately and efficiently.
**Severe:** Severe difficulties learning skills, affecting several academic domains, so
that the individual is unlikely to learn those skills without ongoing intensive individ-
ualized and specialized teaching for most of the school years. Even with an array
of appropriate accommodations or services at home, at school, or in the work-
place, the individual may not be able to complete all activities efficiently.

MOTOR DISORDERS

Developmental Coordination Disorder

The essential feature of developmental coordination disorder is a marked impairment
in the developmental acquisition and execution of skills requiring motor coordination
(Criterion A). Manifestations vary with age and stage of development. For example,
younger children may display delays and clumsiness in achieving developmental
motor milestones such as crawling, sitting, and walking, or in acquiring and using


**52** DSM-5 Guidebook

motor skills or tasks such as negotiating stairs, pedaling bicycles, buttoning shirts,
and using zippers. Older children may display difficulties with motor aspects of as-
sembling puzzles or building models.
Developmental coordination disorder is diagnosed when the impairment signifi-
cantly and persistently interferes with the performance of or participation in daily ac-
tivities in family, social, school, or community life (Criterion B). These include
activities such as getting dressed, eating meals with appropriate utensils, engaging in
physical games with peers, and participating in exercise activities at school. Typically,
the child’s ability to perform these actions is impaired, and there is a marked slow-
ness in their execution. Consequences of this disorder can include reduced participa-
tion in team play and sports, low self-esteem and sense of self-worth, and emotional
or behavioral problems. For adolescents and adults, impairment in fine motor skills
and motor speed may affect performance in the workplace or school setting. Onset is
in the early developmental period (Criterion C).
Developmental coordination disorder must be distinguished from other medical
conditions that may produce coordination problems, such as cerebral palsy or mus-
cular dystrophy, visual impairment, or intellectual disability (intellectual develop-
mental disorder) (Criterion D).

Diagnostic Criteria for Developmental
Coordination Disorder **315.4 (F82)**

A. The acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills is substantially below
that expected given the individual’s chronological age and opportunity for skill
learning and use. Difficulties are manifested as clumsiness (e.g., dropping or
bumping into objects) as well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor
skills (e.g., catching an object, using scissors or cutlery, handwriting, riding a bike,
or participating in sports).

B. The motor skills deficit in Criterion A significantly and persistently interferes with ac-
tivities of daily living appropriate to chronological age (e.g., self-care and self-main-
tenance) and impacts academic/school productivity, prevocational and vocational
activities, leisure, and play.

C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.

D. The motor skills deficits are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellec-
tual developmental disorder) or visual impairment and are not attributable to a neu-
rological condition affecting movement (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy,
degenerative disorder).

Stereotypic Movement Disorder

Stereotypic movement disorder is characterized by repetitive, seemingly driven, and
apparently purposeless motor behavior (Criterion A) that interferes with social, aca-
demic, and other activities or results in self-injury (Criterion B). The disorder has an


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **53**

onset in the early developmental period (Criterion C). The behaviors are not attribut-
able to the physiological effects of a substance or a neurological condition, and are not
better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder (e.g., a compul-
sion as in obsessive-compulsive disorder, a tic as in a tic disorder, a stereotypy that is
part of autism spectrum disorder, or hair pulling as in trichotillomania) (Criterion D).
Typical movements include hand waving, rocking, playing with hands, fiddling with
fingers, twirling objects, head banging, self-biting, and hitting various parts of one’s
own body. These behaviors may cause permanent and disabling tissue damage and
may sometimes be life threatening.
Changes have been made in the criteria for DSM-5. Because the term _nonfunctional_
(DSM-IV Criterion A) may be inaccurate, the wording “apparently purposeless” has
been substituted. Because there is no evidence that the disorder must persist for 4 weeks
or longer, that criterion (DSM-IV Criterion F) has been eliminated.

Diagnostic Criteria for Stereotypic
Movement Disorder **307.3 (F98.4)**

A. Repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor behavior (e.g.,
hand shaking or waving, body rocking, head banging, self-biting, hitting own body).

B. The repetitive motor behavior interferes with social, academic, or other activities
and may result in self-injury.

C. Onset is in the early developmental period.

D. The repetitive motor behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or neurological condition and is not better explained by another
neurodevelopmental or mental disorder (e.g., trichotillomania [hair-pulling disor-
der], obsessive-compulsive disorder).

Specify if:
**With self-injurious behavior** (or behavior that would result in an injury if preven-
tive measures were not used)
**Without self-injurious behavior**

Specify if:
**Associated with a known medical or genetic condition, neurodevelopmental
disorder, or environmental factor** (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, intellectual dis-
ability [intellectual developmental disorder], intrauterine alcohol exposure)
**Coding note:** Use additional code to identify the associated medical or genetic
condition, or neurodevelopmental disorder.

Specify current severity:
**Mild:** Symptoms are easily suppressed by sensory stimulus or distraction.
**Moderate:** Symptoms require explicit protective measures and behavioral modifi-
cation.
**Severe:** Continuous monitoring and protective measures are required to prevent
serious injury.


**54** DSM-5 Guidebook

Tic Disorders

Tic disorders are characterized by the presence of clinically significant tics and differ
mainly with respect to duration and type. The inclusion of five tic disorders—Tourette’s
disorder, persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, provisional tic disorder,
other specified tic disorder, and unspecified tic disorder—represents an expansion
from the four listed in DSM-IV (Walkup et al. 2010). The latter two diagnoses were
added based on research suggesting that tics may result from the effect of certain sub-
stances (e.g., cocaine) or medical conditions (e.g., Huntington’s disease).

Tourette’s Disorder

Tourette’s disorder is characterized by stereotypical but nonrhythmic motor move-
ments and vocalizations. The vocal tics can be socially offensive, such as loud grunt-
ing or barking noises or shouted words, which may be obscenities. The individual is
aware that he or she is producing the vocal tics and is able to exert a mild degree of
control over them, but ultimately must submit to them. Because people with Tourette’s
disorder are aware that their tics are socially inappropriate, they find the tics embar-
rassing. Motor tics occurring in Tourette’s disorder are also often odd or offensive be-
haviors, such as tongue protrusion, sniffing, hopping, squatting, blinking, or nodding.
Because most of the general public is unaware of the nature of Tourette’s disorder, the
behavior is seen as inappropriate or bizarre.

Diagnostic Criteria for Tourette’s Disorder **307.23 (F95.2)**

**Note:** A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization.

A. Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics have been present at some time
during the illness, although not necessarily concurrently.

B. The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than 1 year
since first tic onset.

C. Onset is before age 18 years.

D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., co-
caine) or another medical condition (e.g., Huntington’s disease, postviral encephalitis).

**Criterion A**

The definition of a tic has been made consistent for all tic disorders. The term _stereo-
typed_ has been removed to make it less likely that individuals with stereotypic move-
ment disorder will be diagnosed with a tic disorder.

**Criterion B**

The maximum tic-free interval (DSM-IV Criterion B) was eliminated because there are
no data to suggest that tic-free periods of more than 3 months do _not_ constitute a chronic
course. Also, tic-free intervals are more difficult to assess because they require the pa-


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **55**

tient to recall offset of symptoms, and this may lead to unreliability in diagnosis. DSM-
5 maintains that tics must have persisted for more than 1 year, as in DSM-IV, but it clar-
ifies that the 12-month duration of symptoms is since first tic onset. The phrase “usually
in bouts” was eliminated because this feature of tics is not critical to diagnosis.

**Criteria C and D**

The tics must be present before age 18 years. This requirement helps distinguish
Tourette’s disorder from other causes of tics that occur later in life, such as Hunting-
ton’s disease or postviral encephalitis. Stimulant medication use as an example of a
substance-induced movement disorder is not consistent with the evidence base and
has been eliminated. Cocaine has been substituted as an example.

Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder

The essential feature of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder is the presence
of either motor tics or vocal tics, but not both. This disorder differs from Tourette’s
disorder, for which diagnosis requires _both_ multiple motor tics and one or more vocal
tics. The other features are the same as for Tourette’s disorder, such as onset before
age 18 years. Other disorders, such as Huntington’s disease, need to be ruled out as
causes. The diagnosis cannot be made if the criteria for Tourette’s disorder have ever
been met. The other characteristics are generally the same as for Tourette’s disorder ex-
cept that the severity of the symptoms and the functional impairment are usually
much less. Persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder and Tourette’s disorder
may be genetically related. Clinicians can specify whether the disorder is “with motor
tics only” or “with vocal tics only.”

Diagnostic Criteria for Persistent (Chronic)
Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder **307.22 (F95.1)**

**Note:** A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization.

A. Single or multiple motor or vocal tics have been present during the illness, but not
both motor and vocal.

B. The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than 1 year
since first tic onset.

C. Onset is before age 18 years.

D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g., Huntington’s disease, postviral en-
cephalitis).

E. Criteria have never been met for Tourette’s disorder.

Specify if:
**With motor tics only
With vocal tics only**


**56** DSM-5 Guidebook

**Criteria A and B**

The definition of a tic has been made consistent with that used in the other tic disor-
ders. The changes to Criterion B for persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder
are identical to those for Tourette’s disorder.

**Criteria C and D**

Onset must occur before age 18. This requirement helps separate the disorder from
other causes of tics that occur later in life, such as Huntington’s disease or postviral
encephalitis. Stimulant medication use as an example of a substance-induced move-
ment disorder has been removed. Cocaine has been substituted as an example.

Provisional Tic Disorder

The provisional tic disorder diagnosis represents a modification of transient tic disor-
der in DSM-IV. The DSM-IV criteria were difficult to use because individuals with
current tic symptoms of less than 1 year ’s duration would be diagnosed as having
transient tics when the tics were actually present. Given the need for a diagnostic cat-
egory for persons with tics of less than 1 year’s duration, the transient tic disorder cat-
egory has been renamed _provisional tic disorder._

Diagnostic Criteria for Provisional Tic Disorder **307.21 (F95.0)**

**Note:** A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization.

A. Single or multiple motor and/or vocal tics.

B. The tics have been present for less than 1 year since first tic onset.

C. Onset is before age 18 years.

D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., co-
caine) or another medical condition (e.g., Huntington’s disease, postviral encephalitis).

E. Criteria have never been met for Tourette’s disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or
vocal tic disorder.

**Criteria A, B, C, and D**

The definition of a tic has been made consistent with that used in the other tic disorders.
No evidence suggests that the 4-week threshold described in DSM-IV was valid or use-
ful, so it has been omitted. Onset must occur before age 18; this helps separate the dis-
order from other causes of tics that occur later in life, such as Huntington’s disease or
postviral encephalitis. Stimulant medication use as an example of a substance-induced
movement disorder has been removed. Cocaine has been substituted as an example.

Other Specified Tic Disorder and

Unspecified Tic Disorder

Other specified tic disorder is a diagnosis used when an impairing tic disorder is pres-
ent, but the full criteria for a specific tic disorder or any of the disorders in the neuro-


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **57**

developmental disorders diagnostic class are not met. Unspecified tic disorder is used
when the above conditions are present, but the clinician chooses not to specify the rea-
son that the criteria are not met for a specific disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis. These two
diagnoses replace DSM-IV’s tic disorder not otherwise specified.

Other Specified Tic Disorder **307.20 (F95.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a tic disor-
der that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a
tic disorder or any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic
class. The other specified tic disorder category is used in situations in which the clini-
cian chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet
the criteria for a tic disorder or any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done
by recording “other specified tic disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “with
onset after age 18 years”).

Unspecified Tic Disorder **307.20 (F95.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a tic disor-
der that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a
tic disorder or for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic
class. The unspecified tic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a tic disorder or for
a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes presentations in which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

OTHER NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS

Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder

and Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder

These categories apply to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurode-
velopmental disorder are present and impairing but do not meet the full criteria for any
of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other spec-
ified neurodevelopmental disorder category is used when the clinician chooses to com-
municate the reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria. The unspecified
neurodevelopmental disorder category is used when the clinician chooses not to spec-
ify the reason, or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.


**58** DSM-5 Guidebook

Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder **315.8 (F88)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neuro-
developmental disorder that cause impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-
tant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other specified
neurodevelopmental disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done by recording “other
specified neurodevelopmental disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “neuro-
developmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure”).
An example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation is the following:
**Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure:**
Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure is char-
acterized by a range of developmental disabilities following exposure to alcohol in
utero.

Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder **315.9 (F89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neuro-
developmental disorder that cause impairment in social, occupational, or other impor-
tant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified neu-
rodevelopmental disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific neurodevelopmental
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make
a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- The chapter on neurodevelopmental disorders is a reformulation of the DSM-IV
    chapter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.”
- Mental retardation has been renamed intellectual disability (intellectual devel-
    opmental disorder). Severity is determined on the basis of adaptive functioning
    rather than an IQ score, though diagnostic criteria emphasize the need to as-
    sess cognitive capacity.
- The communication disorders are newly named and include language disorder
    (which combines expressive and mixed receptive-expressive language disorders),
    speech sound disorder (previously phonological disorder), and childhood-onset


**_Neurodevelopmental Disorders_** **59**

```
fluency disorder (previously stuttering). Social (pragmatic) communication dis-
order is new and describes persistent difficulties in the social uses of verbal and
nonverbal communication.
```
- Autism spectrum disorder is a new diagnosis that now subsumes DSM-IV au-
    tistic disorder, Rett’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger’s dis-
    order, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Work
    group members believed that there was little validity to the specific diagnoses
    and that clinicians had difficulty distinguishing them.
- With attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, examples have been added to the
    criterion items to enhance use of these items across the life span. Age at onset
    has been changed from before age 7 years to before age 12 years. A comorbid
    diagnosis with autism spectrum disorder is now allowed. Last, the symptom
    threshold has been changed for adults, with a cutoff of five symptoms instead
    of the six required for younger persons, both for inattention and for hyperactivity
    and impulsivity.
- DSM-IV learning disorder has been changed to specific learning disorder. The
    previous types of learning disorders (reading disorder, mathematics disorder,
    and disorder of written expression) have been combined, and specifiers are
    now used to describe the individual’s impairment.
- With tic disorders, the maximum tic-free interval (DSM-IV Criterion B) was elim-
    inated because there are no scientific data to suggest that tic-free periods of
    more than 3 months do not constitute a chronic course.
