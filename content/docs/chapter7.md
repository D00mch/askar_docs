## The chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders is new to

DSM-5 and brings together disorders previously classified in DSM-IV with the anxi-
ety disorders (obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]), somatoform disorders (body
dysmorphic disorder), and impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified
(trichotillomania). The chapter represents a departure from DSM-IV but shows conti-
nuity with the approach taken by the DSM-5 Task Force to group related disorders to-
gether. Relatedness is a fundamental concept underlying any classification system.
The placement of these disorders in DSM-IV had been criticized because of the per-
ceived failure to recognize the similarities among them. Evidence has accumulated
showing the various disorders’ relatedness to OCD in terms of shared phenomenol-
ogy, patterns of familial aggregation, and etiological mechanisms (Hollander et al.
2011). With these disorders now grouped together, clinicians are encouraged to screen
for these conditions and consider their overlap. Finally, the metastructure of DSM-5
is reflected by the placement of this chapter following the one on anxiety disorders.
The obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (Table 7–1) are unified by the pres-
ence of obsessions (recurrent and persistent intrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges,


**148** DSM-5 Guidebook

or images that lead to marked anxiety or distress) and/or compulsive rituals (repeti-
tive behaviors or mental acts performed in a habitual or stereotyped manner) that
cause significant functional impairment in important life domains. These disorders
are relatively common, with OCD having a lifetime prevalence of 1.6%–3%, and the other
disorders in this chapter having estimated prevalence rates ranging from 1% to 5%.
OCD is one of the top causes of global disability according to the World Health Orga-
nization (2001).

Hoarding—long considered a subtype of OCD—is now accorded its own diagno-
sis, in response to research showing that it has unique features, symptom patterns,
and treatment response. Body dysmorphic disorder has been moved from the DSM-
IV chapter “Somatoform Disorders” in recognition of its close relationship with OCD.
Trichotillomania has been renamed “trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)” and
has been moved from the DSM-IV chapter “Impulse-Control Disorders Not Else-
where Classified.” Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, long considered an impulsive
disorder similar to trichotillomania, is new (Stein et al. 2010).

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

The hallmark of OCD is the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. _Obsessions_ are
recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intru-
sive and unwanted and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress (e.g.,
fears of germs and contamination). _Compulsions_ are repetitive and intentional behaviors
or mental acts performed in response to obsessions or according to certain rules that
must be applied rigidly (e.g., repetitive hand washing, ritualistic checking). Compul-
sions are meant to neutralize or reduce the person’s discomfort or prevent a dreaded
event or situation. The rituals are not connected in a realistic way to the event or situa-
tion or are clearly excessive. The specific definitions for obsessions and compulsions
have treatment implications because each requires a different approach.
First described clinically by Esquirol (1838), OCD was considered a form of mono-
mania, or partial insanity. Esquirol described how disturbed patients would ruminate
on a central theme, giving it their full attention. Later, obsessive-compulsive symp-


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **149**

toms were attributed to depression, but this gave way to their acceptance as a neu-
rotic syndrome. Freud (1895/1962) drew upon his concepts of mental structure and
described _obsessional neurosis,_ a syndrome in which the person struggles with unac-
ceptable impulses (obsessions) and attempts to control them through imperfect de-
fenses that result in rituals (compulsions). Psychoanalytic ideas held sway until
advances in neuroscience and learning theory led to a more useful reconceptualiza-
tion of OCD. As for formal classification, DSM-I included “obsessive compulsive re-
action,” giving rise to “obsessive compulsive neurosis” in DSM-II:

```
This disorder is characterized by the persistent intrusion of unwanted thoughts, urges,
or actions that the patient is unable to stop. The thoughts may consist of single words
or ideas, ruminations, or trains of thought often perceived by the patient as nonsensical.
The actions vary from simple movements to complex rituals such as repeated hand
washing. Anxiety and distress are often present either if the patient is prevented from
completing his compulsive ritual or if he is concerned about being unable to control it
himself. (p. 40)
```
The disorder was included in the Feighner criteria (Feighner et al. 1972), which be-
came the basis for the DSM-III criteria. The criteria were slightly modified for DSM-
III-R and DSM-IV. The DSM-5 criteria have been further refined to reflect the field’s
greater understanding of this disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder **300.3 (F42)**

A. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both:

```
Obsessions are defined by (1) and (2):
```
1. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at
    some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most
    individuals cause marked anxiety or distress.
2. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images,
or to neutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e., by performing a
compulsion).
Compulsions are defined by (1) and (2):
1. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts
(e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven
to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be ap-
plied rigidly.
2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or
distress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behav-
iors or mental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are de-
signed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive.
**Note:** Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these behaviors
or mental acts.
B. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour
per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation-
al, or other important areas of functioning.


**150** DSM-5 Guidebook

C. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
D. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disor-
der (e.g., excessive worries, as in generalized anxiety disorder; preoccupation with
appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with
possessions, as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania [hair-pull-
ing disorder]; skin picking, as in excoriation [skin-picking] disorder; stereotypies, as
in stereotypic movement disorder; ritualized eating behavior, as in eating disorders;
preoccupation with substances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictive
disorders; preoccupation with having an illness, as in illness anxiety disorder; sex-
ual urges or fantasies, as in paraphilic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-
control, and conduct disorders; guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder;
thought insertion or delusional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorders; or repetitive patterns of behavior, as in autism spectrum
disorder).

Specify if:
**With good or fair insight:** The individual recognizes that obsessive-compulsive
disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be
true.
**With poor insight:** The individual thinks obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs
are probably true.
**With absent insight/delusional beliefs:** The individual is completely convinced
that obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true.

Specify if:
**Tic-related:** The individual has a current or past history of a tic disorder.

Criterion A

Instead of four features defining an obsession, as in DSM-IV, DSM-5 relies on two: 1)
“recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some
time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals
cause marked anxiety or distress,” and 2) attempts to “ignore or suppress such thoughts,
urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action.”

**Obsessions**

**Criterion A1.** The wording of Criterion A1 has changed from “recurrent and persis-
tent thoughts, _impulses,_ or images” to “recurrent and persistent thoughts, _urges,_ or im-
ages.” Both _impulse_ and _urge_ capture the involuntary (losing control) nature of some
obsessions. However, _impulse_ indirectly refers to the notion of impulse-control disor-
ders, which may complicate differential diagnosis. For example, someone with klep-
tomania may report recurrent impulses to steal, and so the criteria for OCD would
potentially be met. The change in wording in this criterion, in addition to a larger ex-
clusionary list in Criterion D, is aimed at preventing this misdiagnosis. Interestingly,
_urge_ was a descriptor used in DSM-II.
Additionally, the DSM-IV definition of _obsession_ stated that the thoughts are “experi-
enced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and _inappropriate._ ” In DSM-5,


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **151**

the last word has been changed to _unwanted_. Replacing _inappropriate_ with _unwanted_ at-
tempts to address the difficulties in operationalizing the ego-dystonic quality of ob-
sessional thoughts. In DSM-III, the term _ego-dystonic_ was used to reflect the belief that
obsessional thoughts are involuntary and regarded as senseless or repugnant. In DSM-
III-R, _ego-dystonic_ was replaced with _senseless_. In DSM-IV, _senseless_ was dropped be-
cause the term could imply a loss of reality testing and thereby confuse OCD with psy-
choses. Also, the term _inappropriate_ may have different definitions based on culture,
gender, and age; use of the term _unwanted_ in DSM-5 seeks to avoid these social and cul-
tural differences that may complicate the diagnosis.
The final change in the DSM-5 definition of obsession is the addition of “in most
individuals” before the phrase “cause marked anxiety or distress.” Data from several
large studies show that although most people with OCD experience at least moderate
anxiety or distress from obsessional thoughts, not all obsessions generate marked
anxiety or distress. In addition, some people who have experienced OCD for many
years may not report the same level of anxiety or distress from their obsessions as
they did at illness onset.

**Criterion A2.** Many DSM-5 disorders are characterized by repetitive thoughts or
behaviors, and these must be distinguished from obsessions and compulsions. The
statement that the person attempts to ignore or suppress the obsessive thoughts,
urges, or images, or to neutralize them by performing a compulsion, provides a func-
tional link between obsessions and compulsions. This link allows the clinician to dis-
tinguish the thoughts of OCD from those found in anxiety disorders such as
generalized anxiety disorder _because_ of the presence of compulsions. Although not
everyone with OCD reports obsessions _and_ compulsions, the vast majority (approxi-
mately 90%) do so.
In DSM-5, two DSM-IV criteria have been deleted from the definition of obsession:
that the thoughts are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems (A2) and
that the person recognizes that the thoughts are a product of his or her own mind
(A4). These criteria were originally used to distinguish OCD from generalized anxiety
disorder (e.g., a person worrying excessively about financial problems when out of
work) and from psychotic disorders (e.g., when a person believes someone has in-
serted these thoughts into his or her head). In DSM-5, instead of being used to define
an obsession, these criteria have been incorporated into Criterion D, which includes
information about the differential diagnosis between OCD, generalized anxiety dis-
order, psychotic disorders, and other mental disorders.

**Compulsions**

**Criterion A1.** Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that a person feels driven to per-
form. The “feels driven” aspect of the behavior reflects that the behavior is not willed,
purposeful, or intentional.

**Criterion A2.** The definition of compulsion requires that the person’s motivation
for the behavior be to reduce or prevent anxiety or distress associated with an obses-
sive thought. For example, a person may need to write a sentence over and over again


**152** DSM-5 Guidebook

as a means of reducing the anxiety associated with “just right” obsessions. Another
example is when a person asks forgiveness multiple times to reduce the distress from
an obsessive thought of violence. This requirement that the compulsion be designed
to reduce anxiety or distress from an obsession helps to differentiate the behavior
from repetitive behaviors seen in tics or stereotypies.
The requirement that the compulsive behavior be designed to reduce a negative
feeling triggered by an obsessive thought also differentiates OCD from repetitive be-
haviors seen in impulsive or addictive disorders. The motivating drive behind impulsive
or addictive behaviors is generally, although not exclusively, the pleasure or gratifi-
cation associated with the behavior.
The second criterion further defines compulsive behaviors as those that are “not
connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or
are clearly excessive.” For example, most people consider it advisable to check that
the iron is unplugged and lights are off before leaving home. Checking once or twice
is prudent, whereas checking multiple times is clearly excessive. The extremes, such as
checking 30 times, are much easier to recognize than the “gray areas” of checking (e.g.,
four times).

Criterion B

DSM-IV’s Criterion B has been deleted from DSM-5. It stated that during the course
of illness, “the person has recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are exces-
sive or unreasonable.” Because _excessive_ and _unreasonable_ were not defined or opera-
tionalized, it was unclear how clinicians and researchers should interpret the terms.
DSM-5 Criterion B is a modified version of DSM-IV Criterion C. Given that most
people have some obsessive thoughts or engage in repetitive behaviors, this criterion
gives the clinician a general threshold for when thoughts or behaviors may be consid-
ered problematic and not normative. The time threshold should be considered an ap-
proximation for when these thoughts or behaviors have become excessive, which is
why the phrase “take more than 1 hour per day” has been added as an example. Many
people with OCD rationalize that their behavior is useful; they also may present with
an apparent lack of concern over the behavior or lack insight regarding the impact of
these symptoms on their lives. Ritualistic behaviors that consume more than 1 hour
per day are not necessarily evidence of OCD. For example, a surgeon may wash her
hands more than 1 hour each day, and yet this should not be taken as evidence of OCD.

Criterion C

This item mirrors DSM-IV Criterion E, with minor edits, and is intended to remind
clinicians to distinguish OCD from obsessions or compulsions that occur in relation
to substance use or a medical condition. For example, people who misuse stimulants
(e.g., amphetamines) sometimes report compulsive skin picking. Likewise, individu-
als treated with dopaminergic medications (e.g., pramipexole) for Parkinson’s dis-
ease often exhibit “punding” behaviors, which are repetitive mechanical tasks, such
as sorting, collecting, or assembling/disassembling common items. An OCD diagno-
sis is not appropriate in these cases.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **153**

Criterion D

Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by recurrent, intrusive thoughts and/or re-
petitive behaviors. This criterion clarifies the instances in which the diagnosis of OCD
would not be appropriate. DSM-5 has expanded the list of diagnoses with symptoms
that may resemble those in OCD, to include disorders such as major depressive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, illness anxiety disorder, impulse-control disorders, hoard-
ing disorder, excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, and paraphilic disorders.

Specifiers

The subtyping of OCD has been expanded to allow clinicians to make a more detailed
assessment of the individual and his or her disorder (Leckman et al. 2010). Instead of
the single specifier “with poor insight,” as in DSM-IV, DSM-5 includes a range of in-
sight specifiers (good or fair, poor, absent), as well as a specifier of tic-related OCD.
Because insight may fluctuate over time, the insight specifier has been changed to re-
fer to the current presentation. The revised specifiers have the potential advantage of
conveying the broad range of insight that can characterize OCD beliefs, including de-
lusional beliefs. Insight may be associated with clinical presentation (e.g., greater
OCD severity, higher rates of co-occurring depression) and treatment outcome (e.g.,
less robust treatment response to cognitive-behavioral therapy).
Research evidence provides support for the inclusion of a tic-related specifier. This
OCD variant is highly familial with specific clinical characteristics (early onset, male
predominance) and high rates of symmetry and exactness obsessions and of ordering
and arranging compulsions, as well as sensory phenomena. Individuals with symp-
toms characteristic of this specifier may also benefit differentially from antipsychotic
augmentation if treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor does not suf-
ficiently reduce the symptoms.

Body Dysmorphic Disorder

Body dysmorphic disorder requires both obsessional thoughts regarding perceived
defects in appearance and, at some point, compulsive behaviors that develop in re-
sponse to those thoughts. Body dysmorphic disorder and OCD have many similarities—
symptoms, aspects of treatment response, comorbidities, and perhaps underlying
pathophysiology. They also have important differences; for example, people with body
dysmorphic disorder have poorer insight and are more likely to have suicidal ide-
ation and co-occurring substance use disorders.
The condition has been referred to in the past as _dysmorphophobia._ Body dysmor-
phic disorder was included in DSM-III as an example of an atypical somatoform disor-
der and received full disorder status in DSM-III-R. DSM-IV continued to include body
dysmorphic disorder with the somatoform disorders. The relocation of body dysmor-
phic disorder to the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders reflects research re-
garding its etiological relationship with OCD (Phillips et al. 2010).
Body dysmorphic disorder is relatively common, with prevalence rates in the general
population of 0.7%–2.4%, although studies of clinical samples suggest higher rates: 3%–


**154** DSM-5 Guidebook

16% among cosmetic surgery patients, 9%–15% among dermatology patients, 8%–12%
among patients with OCD, and 39% among patients with anorexia nervosa.

Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder **300.7 (F45.22)**

A. Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance
that are not observable or appear slight to others. 
B. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed re-
petitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reas-
surance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that
of others) in response to the appearance concerns.
C. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat
or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating
disorder.

Specify if:
**With muscle dysmorphia:** The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or
her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if
the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case.

Specify if:
Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., “I look ugly”
or “I look deformed”).

```
With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic
disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be
true.
With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs
are probably true.
With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced
that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true.
```
Criterion A

Persons with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with the idea that some as-
pect or aspects of their appearance look abnormal. They may describe these areas as
being unattractive, deformed, disfigured, ugly, hideous, or “not right.” The face or
head is commonly the body area that troubles these individuals, with a focus on skin
flaws, defects, blemishes, wrinkles, scars, or supposed acne. Typically, these individ-
uals are preoccupied with their appearance for several hours each day. DSM-5 has
changed the initial criterion from preoccupation with an “imagined defect in appear-
ance” to preoccupation with “perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that
are not observable or appear slight to others.” This clarifies the criterion’s meaning,
and eliminating the term _imagined_ prevents clinicians from characterizing the disor-
der as due to psychosis.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **155**

Criterion B

All people with body dysmorphic disorder have at some point in their illness per-
formed repetitive, time-consuming behaviors in response to their preoccupations.
These behaviors focus on examining, improving, being reassured about, or hiding the
perceived defect. These behaviors are often described as “compulsive” in the sense
that the urge to perform them is strong and difficult to resist. They are also sometimes
referred to as “safety behaviors,” meaning that they are performed to prevent a feared
catastrophe (e.g., camouflaging “ghostlike” skin with bronzer to prevent feared scru-
tiny by other people).

Criterion C

This item recognizes that individuals with body dysmorphic disorder experience
clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning
because of their appearance concerns. They also have poor quality of life; about 25%
of individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are so distressed that they attempt sui-
cide. However, severity varies, with some individuals appearing to lead relatively
normal lives despite the distress and interference they experience.

Criterion D

Body dysmorphic disorder must be distinguished from eating disorders. Body dys-
morphic disorder and anorexia nervosa, for example, share disturbed body image
and a preoccupation with perceived appearance flaws. Many individuals with an-
orexia nervosa are preoccupied with aspects of appearance other than weight, such
as the size of the stomach or thighs, or even body areas such as the skin or nose. Con-
versely, some individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with body
weight and body shape. Although anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder
have similarities, as well as some overlap, they also appear to have some important
differences, including gender distribution (more individuals with anorexia nervosa
are female), comorbidity, patterns of familial aggregation of psychiatric disorders, and
response to treatment.

Specifiers

In DSM-5, specifiers regarding whether the body dysmorphic disorder focuses on
one’s body build (muscle dysmorphia, defined as preoccupation with the idea that
one’s body is too small or not muscular enough) and insight have been added.
Muscle dysmorphia appears to have several important differences from other
forms of body dysmorphic disorder (e.g., higher rates of suicidal behavior, comorbid
substance use disorders), and the treatment approach may require some modifica-
tion. Thus, adding this specifier may have clinical utility.
Although the majority of individuals with body dysmorphic disorder also have
ideas of reference (thinking that others notice their imagined defect and react to it with
dislike or disgust), there appear to be far more similarities than differences between de-
lusional and nondelusional body dysmorphic disorder. The insight specifier reflects the


**156** DSM-5 Guidebook

broad range of insight (including delusional thinking) that can characterize body dys-
morphic disorder beliefs. These levels of insight are similar to categories in widely used
scales for body dysmorphic disorder, and they are the same as those for OCD.

Hoarding Disorder

Hoarding is a persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions. The accu-
mulation of possessions makes it hard to use living areas of the home for their in-
tended purposes (Frost et al. 2012; Mataix-Cols et al. 2010). The hoarding causes
clinically significant distress or impairment. Hoarding is surprisingly common and
potentially disabling. Significant hoarding has been shown to occur in 2%–6% of the
general population. Prior to DSM-5, hoarding was mentioned in DSM-IV only in the
context of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (Item 5), but the related text
suggests that serious hoarding behavior should be considered a form of OCD. The high
prevalence and serious consequences of hoarding disorder, together with research on
its distinctiveness from OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, have
led the authors of DSM-5 to classify it as an independent disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Hoarding Disorder **300.3 (F42)**

A. Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual
value.
B. This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associ-
ated with discarding them.
C. The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions
that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their in-
tended use. If living areas are uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of
third parties (e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities).
D. The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning (including maintaining a safe envi-
ronment for self and others).
E. The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., brain injury,
cerebrovascular disease, Prader-Willi syndrome).
F. The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder
(e.g., obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, decreased energy in major
depressive disorder, delusions in schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder,
cognitive deficits in major neurocognitive disorder, restricted interests in autism
spectrum disorder).

Specify if:
**With excessive acquisition:** If difficulty discarding possessions is accompanied by
excessive acquisition of items that are not needed or for which there is no available
space.

Specify if:
**With good or fair insight:** The individual recognizes that hoarding-related beliefs
and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acqui-
sition) are problematic.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **157**

```
With poor insight : The individual is mostly convinced that hoarding-related beliefs
and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acqui-
sition) are not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.
With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced
that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding
items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are not problematic despite evidence to the
contrary.
```
Criterion A

The desire to retain objects of value, either sentimental or financial, is common. With
hoarding disorder, the difficulty with discarding possessions seems driven by fears of
losing important things. Criterion A refers to the core characteristic, which is diffi-
culty discarding. The wording “discarding or parting with” is intended to make clear
that this difficulty is not confined to throwing things away, but rather to any attempt
to let go of a possession, including giving it away, recycling it, or selling it. The second
clause, “regardless of their actual value,” distinguishes this definition from that used
to define hoarding as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder in
DSM-IV, in which the hoarding was defined as being “unable to discard worn-out or
worthless objects.” What is considered worthless or worn out varies considerably
from person to person. The most frequently hoarded items include clothes, newspa-
pers, and magazines. Many of these items, especially clothes, are frequently new and
never worn.

Criterion B

A central feature of hoarding disorder is the need to save possessions. Clutter that re-
sults is due to purposeful saving and reluctance to discard items because they have
sentimental significance, are potentially useful, or have intrinsic aesthetic value. The
nature of emotional attachment is reflected in the person’s reaction to getting rid of a
possession; the emotion experienced is either anxiety or a feeling of grief at the loss.
Associated with this is the tendency to assign humanlike qualities to possessions. An-
other form of emotional attachment concerns a sense of comfort and security pro-
vided by possessions. The thought of getting rid of a possession appears to violate
feelings of safety.

Criterion C

The major consequence of hoarding is disorganized clutter, which elicits great con-
cern from family and friends. Clutter makes a space unusable or unsanitary, and find-
ing important items may be nearly impossible. This criterion emphasizes the living
areas of the home or workspace rather than locations such as attics, basements, or ga-
rages, which are sometimes cluttered in homes of persons without hoarding disorder.
In some cases, family members keep the living area from being cluttered, and in such
cases, the individual can still receive a diagnosis of hoarding disorder if sufficient dis-
tress or other impairment is generated by the behavior.


**158** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion D

People who hoard experience distress largely due to the consequences of the behav-
ior, such as conflict with family members over the clutter, and not due to the thoughts
or behaviors themselves. Research suggests that functioning is impaired in a variety
of domains. People are often unable to use living spaces in the home, and in severe
cases appliances are not functional and utilities such as water and electricity are shut
off. Hoarding poses a serious public health burden (e.g., fire hazards, infestations)
and increases costs to the public in the form of involvement by social service agencies.

Criterion E

Several other medical conditions can lead to clutter and difficulty discarding posses-
sions. For example, hoarding behaviors have occurred in people with lesions in the
anterior ventromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Also, many individuals with
Prader-Willi syndrome (a rare genetic disorder associated with short stature, hyper-
phagia, insatiability, and food-seeking behavior) display hoarding behavior, mostly
associated with food, but with nonfood items as well.

Criterion F

In some people, hoarding may be related to OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, or
major depressive disorder instead of being an independent disorder. These disorders
need to be ruled out. Hoarding behavior can also occur in individuals with severe de-
mentia; however, hoarding associated with dementia appears to stem from significant
cognitive deterioration rather than from excessive attachment to objects. Hoarding is
also described in institutionalized patients with schizophrenia, but the behavior does
not appear to be motivated by a true attachment to objects. OCD is the disorder most
closely associated with hoarding, and about approximately 20% of individuals with
OCD have hoarding symptoms. In some cases where the hoarding behavior appears
to be secondary to more classic OCD symptoms, such as contamination, the diagnosis
of hoarding disorder would not be appropriate.

Specifiers

DSM-5 includes the specifier “with excessive acquisition.” People with hoarding prob-
lems tend to buy and carry with them a large number of “just in case” items, and stud-
ies have confirmed excessive acquiring in the context of hoarding. Acquisition of free
things also tends to be excessive. Stealing is another form of excessive acquisition as-
sociated with hoarding. Although only a small percentage of people with hoarding
disorder steal, kleptomania is not uncommon (10%). The diagnostic criteria do not in-
clude excessive acquisition, because a small percentage (10%–15%) of people who
hoard report no excessive acquisition.
Insight specifiers similar to those for OCD are also available. When the disorder is
severe, the hoarding may appear to take on delusional proportions. Clinicians gener-
ally rate hoarding patients as having poor or limited insight compared with more typ-
ical individuals with OCD. Sometimes the term _insight_ is confused with _overvalued_


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **159**

_ideation,_ which refers to a belief maintained despite evidence to the contrary. In the
context of hoarding, overvalued ideation involves beliefs about the value or useful-
ness of possessions. Many individuals with hoarding recognize the problem with
their behavior, but their unreasonable ideas about the value of their possessions make
it impossible for them to discard. This may appear to an observer as a lack of insight,
but in reality these beliefs about the value and usefulness of possessions may repre-
sent part of the disorder.

Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)

Trichotillomania involves repetitive hair pulling leading to noticeable hair loss, sub-
jective distress, and social or occupational impairment. Research has shown that the
prevalence of trichotillomania among adults and adolescents in the United States
ranges from 1% to 2%. Trichotillomania was included in the DSM-IV chapter “Im-
pulse-Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified.”
The name has been modified in DSM-5 by including a more descriptive term— _hair-
pulling disorder_ —parenthetically. Given that research in clinical phenomenology, neurobi-
ology, and genetics has suggested an association between trichotillomania and OCD,
DSM-5 includes trichotillomania with the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

Diagnostic Criteria for Trichotillomania
(Hair-Pulling Disorder) **312.39 (F63.3)**

A. Recurrent pulling out of one’s hair, resulting in hair loss.
B. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling.
C. The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a
dermatological condition).
E. The hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder
(e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dys-
morphic disorder).

Criterion A

Hair pulling may occur in any body region. The most common sites are the scalp, eye-
brows, and eyelids; less common sites are axillary, facial, pubic, and perirectal regions.
Hair-pulling sites may vary over time, and hair pulling may occur in brief episodes scat-
tered throughout the day or in less frequent but more sustained periods. Criterion A re-
quires that hair pulling lead to hair loss, but unlike in DSM-IV, this criterion does not
require that the hair loss be “noticeable.” In fact, individuals with trichotillomania may
pull hair in a widely distributed pattern (i.e., pulling single hairs from all over a site) such
that hair loss may not be clearly visible. Alternatively, individuals may attempt to conceal
or camouflage hair loss (e.g., with makeup, scarves, or wigs).


**160** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion B

This item requires that individuals with trichotillomania attempt unsuccessfully to
control their pulling. This criterion reflects the intense drive underlying the behavior.
The criterion also more accurately represents what many individuals with the condi-
tion report (i.e., that they do not feel tension before pulling or experience relief or grat-
ification after pulling). This item replaces DSM-IV’s Criteria B (“sense of tension imme-
diately before pulling”) and C (“pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the
hair”) based on evidence that some individuals with trichotillomania did not have
these symptoms and thus their presentations did not qualify for the diagnosis.

Criterion C

Trichotillomania is associated with subjective distress as well as with social and occu-
pational impairment. The disorder causes significant embarrassment. People attempt
to avoid pulling in front of others and to avoid situations where the consequences of
pulling may be noticed (e.g., swimming, sexual intimacy). Individuals also attempt to
camouflage bald spots with wigs or scarfs. In addition, there may be irreversible dam-
age to hair growth and hair quality. Infrequent medical consequences of behavior in-
clude digit purpura, musculoskeletal injury (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome; back,
shoulder, and neck pain), blepharitis, and dental damage (e.g., worn or broken teeth
due to hair biting). Swallowing of hair (trichophagia) may lead to trichobezoars, with
subsequent anemia, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea and vomiting, bowel ob-
struction, and even perforation.

Criterion D

Trichotillomania is not diagnosed when the hair pulling or hair loss is due to another
medical condition (e.g., inflammation of the skin or other dermatological conditions).
Other causes of scarring alopecia (e.g., alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, telogen
effluvium) or nonscarring alopecia (e.g., chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen
planopilaris, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, pseudopelade, folliculitis decal-
vans, dissecting folliculitis, acne keloidalis) should be considered in individuals with
hair loss who deny hair pulling. Skin biopsy or dermoscopy can be used to differen-
tiate individuals with trichotillomania from those with dermatological disorders.

Criterion E

Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder may remove body hair they perceive as
ugly or abnormal. People with OCD may pull out hairs as part of their symmetry rit-
uals. Hair pulling may meet the definition of stereotyped behaviors (as in stereotypic
movement disorder), but the diagnostic criteria for stereotypic movement disorder
exclude symptoms better explained by trichotillomania. Individuals with a psychosis
may remove hair in response to delusions or hallucinations. Trichotillomania is not
diagnosed in such cases. Although hair-pulling symptoms may be exacerbated by
certain substances, such as stimulants, it is not clear that substances can be the pri-
mary cause of recurrent hair pulling.

Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder

Excoriation disorder is characterized by the recurrent, compulsive picking of skin, lead-
ing to skin lesions. Although long described in the medical literature, excoriation dis-
order is new to DSM-5, partly in response to the growing body of data emphasizing
its prevalence and potentially disabling nature. There are significant clinical similari-
ties between excoriation disorder and trichotillomania, and the criteria for the two dis-
orders are very similar. The criteria for excoriation disorder are supported by a field
survey.
Prevalence studies have found that excoriation disorder occurs in 1.4%–5.4% of
the general population. Often considered chronic, the disorder fluctuates in intensity
and severity. Few people with this disorder seek treatment.

Diagnostic Criteria for Excoriation (Skin-Picking)
Disorder **698.4 (L98.1)**

A. Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions.
B. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking.
C. The skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The skin picking is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g., scabies).
E. The skin picking is not better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder
(e.g., delusions or tactile hallucinations in a psychotic disorder, attempts to improve
a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder, stereotypies
in stereotypic movement disorder, or intention to harm oneself in nonsuicidal self-
injury).

Criterion A

All individuals at some time pick at their skin, either to smooth out irregularities or
to improve blemishes or acne. Criterion A requires that picking be recurrent and re-
sult in lesions, thereby reflecting the frequency and intensity of the picking. Although
the face is the most commonly reported site of picking, areas such as the hands, fingers,
torso, arms, and legs are also common targets. Individuals with excoriation disorder
report multiple sites of picking and the use of multiple instruments (e.g., fingernails,
knives, tweezers, pins). Picking may result in significant tissue damage and may lead
to medical complications such as localized infections and septicemia.

Criterion B

This criterion requires that the person has tried to decrease or stop the picking, reflect-
ing the intense drive underlying the behavior. Neurocognitive data support the idea
that individuals with this disorder have difficulty inhibiting motor behaviors once
the behaviors have begun.


**162** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion C

Individuals with excoriation disorder spend a significant amount of time picking
their skin, with many reporting that the behavior takes up several hours each day.
Because of the amount of time spent picking, individuals report missing or being
late for work, school, or social activities. The picking also leads to problems with self-
esteem and difficulties in personal relationships.

Criterion D

Use of stimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines can lead to skin picking
and should be ruled out. In addition, many dermatological conditions, including sca-
bies, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and blistering skin disorders, can lead to scratching
or picking.

Criterion E

Excoriation disorder is often misdiagnosed as either OCD or body dysmorphic disor-
der. The repetitive motor symptoms of excoriation disorder resemble compulsive rit-
uals, although individuals are less likely to report obsessive thoughts about their skin
and may even be unaware of their picking behavior because of its automatic nature.
Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder pick at their skin to improve their ap-
pearance.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder

It is important to consider whether any of the symptoms associated with OCD or re-
lated disorders are due to the direct effects of a substance, in which case the appropriate
diagnosis is substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, or substance/medication-
induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. A range of obsessive thoughts
and compulsive behaviors occur as part of substance intoxication or substance with-
drawal. If the obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors persist for a substantial pe-
riod of time after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication, and are in
excess of what is expected and warrant independent clinical attention, then the diag-
nosis of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is
appropriate.

Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder

A. Obsessions, compulsions, skin picking, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive
behaviors, or other symptoms characteristic of the obsessive-compulsive and re-
lated disorders predominate in the clinical picture.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **163**

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
both (1) and (2):

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxi-
    cation or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in
Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by an obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an indepen-
dent obsessive-compulsive and related disorder could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symp-
toms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessa-
tion of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-in-
duced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent
non-substance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of substance intoxi-
cation or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in
the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medi-
cation]-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are indicated in the table
below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid
substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use
disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related dis-
order, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance]
use disorder” before the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
(e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and relat-
ed disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-
stance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character
is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe
[substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use dis-
order. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use
of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record
only the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.

for diagnoses associated with substance class):
**With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
**With onset during withdrawal:** If criteria are met for withdrawal from the sub-
stance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.
**With onset after medication use:** Symptoms may appear either at initiation of
medication or after a modification or change in use.

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

The initial evaluation of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders requires that the
clinician rule out medical conditions as a cause of the symptoms. If a medical condi-
tion is present, and the OCD or related disorder is determined to be the direct patho-
physiological consequence of the medical condition, then the person should be
diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition. When communicating or recording the diagnosis, the clinician should use
the name of the etiological medical condition. That said, although cases have been re-
ported in the literature of various medical conditions inducing obsessive-compulsive
behaviors, they are rare.

Diagnostic Criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive and
Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition **294.8 (F06.8)**

A. Obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance, hoarding, skin pick-
ing, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive behaviors, or other symptoms char-
acteristic of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder predominate in the clinical
picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical
condition.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:
**With obsessive-compulsive disorder–like symptoms:** If obsessive-compulsive
disorder–like symptoms predominate in the clinical presentation.
**With appearance preoccupations:** If preoccupation with perceived appearance
defects or flaws predominates in the clinical presentation.
**With hoarding symptoms:** If hoarding predominates in the clinical presentation.


**_Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders_** **165**

```
With hair-pulling symptoms: If hair pulling predominates in the clinical presen-
tation.
With skin-picking symptoms: If skin picking predominates in the clinical presen-
tation.
```
**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the
mental disorder (e.g., 294.8 [F06.8] obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due
to cerebral infarction). The other medical condition should be coded and listed sepa-
rately immediately before the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to the
medical condition (e.g., 438.89 [I69.398] cerebral infarction; 294.8 [F06.8] obsessive-
compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction).

Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and

Related Disorder and Unspecified Obsessive-

Compulsive and Related Disorder

These are residual categories to use for individuals with symptoms of an obsessive-
compulsive or related disorder who have distress or impairment but whose symp-
toms do not meet criteria for a more specific disorder in the class. The category other
specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is used when the clinician
chooses to communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet full criteria.
The clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., body dysmorphic–like
disorder with actual flaws).
The category unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is used when
the clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met, or there is in-
sufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and
Related Disorder **300.3 (F42)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an obses-
sive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate
but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive
and related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to com-
municate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any
specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. This is done by recording “other
specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder” followed by the specific reason
(e.g., “body-focused repetitive behavior disorder”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:


**166** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. **Body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws:** This is similar to body dys-
    morphic disorder except that the defects or flaws in physical appearance are clear-
    ly observable by others (i.e., they are more noticeable than “slight”). In such cases,
    the preoccupation with these flaws is clearly excessive and causes significant im-
    pairment or distress.
2. **Body dysmorphic–like disorder without repetitive behaviors:** Presentations
    that meet body dysmorphic disorder except that the individual has not performed
    repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the appearance concerns.
3. **Body-focused repetitive behavior disorder:** This is characterized by recurrent
    body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., nail biting, lip biting, cheek chewing) and
    repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviors. These symptoms cause clin-
    ically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
    areas of functioning and are not better explained by trichotillomania (hair-pulling
    disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, stereotypic movement disorder, or
    nonsuicidal self-injury.
4. **Obsessional jealousy:** This is characterized by nondelusional preoccupation with
    a partner’s perceived infidelity. The preoccupations may lead to repetitive behav-
    iors or mental acts in response to the infidelity concerns; they cause clinically sig-
    nificant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
    functioning; and they are not better explained by another mental disorder such as
    delusional disorder, jealous type, or paranoid personality disorder.
5. **Shubo-kyofu:** A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of
    Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5) that is similar to body dysmorphic disorder
    and is characterized by excessive fear of having a bodily deformity.
6. **Koro:** Related to dhat syndrome (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress”
    in the Appendix to DSM-5), an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the pe-
    nis (or the vulva and nipples in females) will recede into the body, possibly leading
    to death.
7. **Jikoshu-kyofu:** A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of
Distress” in the Appendix to DSM-5) characterized by fear of having an offensive
body odor (also termed olfactory reference syndrome).

Unspecified Obsessive-Compulsive and
Related Disorder **300.3 (F42)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an obses-
sive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate
but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive
and related disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified obsessive-compulsive and re-
lated disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to spec-
ify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information
to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- This chapter is new and reflects the scientific understanding that a spectrum of
    disorders related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is sufficiently distinct
    from anxiety disorders that it should stand alone.
- Hoarding disorder and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder are new, both achiev-
    ing full disorder status because of data showing their high prevalence, associ-
    ated functional impairment, and familial relationship to OCD.
- Trichotillomania is now termed “trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)” and has
    been moved from the DSM-IV chapter “Impulse-Control Disorders Not Else-
    where Classified.” Body dysmorphic disorder has been moved from the DSM-
    IV “Somatoform Disorders” chapter. In each case, the Anxiety, Obsessive-Com-
    pulsive Spectrum, Posttraumatic, and Dissociative Disorders Work Group rec-
    ognized the putative etiological relationship with OCD.
- A “muscle dysmorphia” specifier for body dysmorphic disorder has been added
    in recognition of the growing literature on this distinction.
- The OCD criteria have been revised to emphasize that obsessions are often urg-
    es, not impulses, and that they are intrusive and unwanted rather than merely in-
    appropriate. The DSM-IV “with poor insight” specifier has been refined, and an
    analogous specifier has been added for body dysmorphic disorder.
