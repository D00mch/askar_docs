## The Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group developed a new

model for the assessment of personality disorders and traits that included both cate-
gorical diagnoses and dimensional approaches. Although the proposal was not ac-
cepted by the American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees for inclusion in
Section II, the board chose to include it in Section III (as the chapter “Alternative
DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders”). According to DSM-5, this approach “pre-
serve[s] continuity with current clinical practice, while also introducing a new ap-
proach that aims to address numerous shortcomings of the current approach to
personality disorders” (American Psychiatric Association 2013, p. 761).
The work group proposed a wholesale reformulation of the personality disorder
class. This involved the elimination of 4 of 10 personality disorders and the introduc-
tion of a hybrid assessment scheme combining categorical diagnosis with the optional
dimensional assessment of personality impairment and pathological traits. Work
group members were influenced by many factors and considered the time ripe for a
new approach to personality assessment. Among their many concerns: 1) the number
(10) of personality disorders, some of which were rarely used and poorly supported
by the literature; 2) diagnostic criteria that failed to tap important psychological di-
mensions in favor of behavioral traits; 3) frequent comorbidity that made it uncommon


**450** DSM-5 Guidebook

for a person to be diagnosed with a single personality disorder type; 4) polythetic cri-
teria (i.e., the “Chinese menu” approach) that contributed to the heterogeneity seen
with some disorders, such as borderline personality disorder, which requires at least
five of nine symptoms, leading to 151 ways to satisfy the criteria, with none required
(Sanislow et al. 2002); and, finally, 5) the fact that clinicians had little opportunity to
fully describe the extent of a person’s personality pathology because of the lack of di-
mensional approaches. The work group concluded that the two approaches were
complementary and offered advantages over the DSM-IV approach, and they devel-
oped a new model to address these concerns.
Their model came under critical fire from both clinicians and researchers almost
from the outset. Although critics generally acknowledged the value of dimensional
assessments, the proposed model was considered too complicated for busy clinicians,
many of whom—it was thought—would never have time to use it. Further, many
psychiatrists are unfamiliar with the personality domains and traits assessed (which
came largely from the field of academic psychology) and expressed discomfort with
the model. Many were concerned that use of the model for dimensionally rating per-
sonality domains and traits would be mandatory and not optional. Interestingly, the
use of dimensional ratings was considered during the development of DSM-III but
was rejected mainly because of the relative lack of familiarity that psychiatrists have
with such systems and the concern that the systems provide more information than
clinicians would use (Spitzer et al. 1980). The use of any new system involves a learn-
ing curve, and this was especially true when DSM-III was rolled out and required that
clinicians rethink their approach to assessment and diagnosis.
In the alternative model, categorical diagnosis has been preserved. The number of
personality disorders has been reduced from 10 to 6. It was thought that reducing the
number of diagnoses would help minimize the problem of frequent comorbidity. Be-
cause there have been very few empirical studies of the paranoid, schizoid, histrionic,
and dependent types, these disorders were thought appropriate for exclusion. Al-
though there had been some initial discussion about deleting narcissistic personality
disorder as well, the work group decided to retain it in their model (Ronningstam 2011).
The rationale for retaining the six disorders was based on evidence of disorder
prevalence, degree of psychosocial impairment, and other research supporting the
validity of the diagnoses. For example, the antisocial, borderline, and schizotypal types
have extensive evidence regarding validity and clinical usefulness. The narcissistic
type was retained largely on the basis of the substantial clinician interest in the disorder
despite its infrequent use.
The criteria for the six personality disorders were revised to make them uniform
and to ensure that they were based on a standard set of empirically tested personality
domains and traits. The criteria are not polythetic, in order to address concerns about
heterogeneity. Diagnosis of any of the six personality disorders requires that the indi-
vidual have impairments in personality functioning (Criterion A) and pathological
personality traits specific to the disorder (Criterion B). Although not part of the dis-
order-specific criteria (but part of the general personality disorder criteria), the indi-
vidual also must have impairment of functioning that is stable across time (Criterion D)
and consistent across situations (Criterion C), and the impairments must not be nor-


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **451**

mative for the person’s developmental stage or sociocultural environment (Criterion
G) and must not be due to a substance or another medical condition (Criterion F). For
individuals who do not fit within these diagnoses, the new category personality dis-
order—trait specified is used (replacing the DSM-IV category personality disorder
not otherwise specified).
Categorical diagnosis is combined with an optional dimensional assessment of
the individual’s level of personality impairment and pathological personality traits
(Krueger and Eaton 2010; Krueger et al. 2011). When impairments are present, the
Level of Personality Functioning Scale can be used to assess degree of disturbance in
self- and interpersonal functioning. Components of self-functioning involve identity
and self-direction, whereas components of interpersonal functioning involve empa-
thy and intimacy. Impairment is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (healthy
functioning) to 4 (poor functioning). Ratings can also be made for a broad range of
adaptive and maladaptive personality trait domains and facets, to identify the nature
and extent of personality pathology, information that may be helpful for treatment
planning. The personality domains and trait facets can be used to describe the person-
ality characteristics of any individual, even those without a personality disorder.
The work group drew on existing models of maladaptive personality traits and
reached consensus on the broad domains of personality that the new system should
encompass, influenced by McCrae and Costa’s (1987) five-factor model. The five do-
mains are negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoti-
cism. Each comprises a lower order of specific traits called _facets._ Trait facets are useful
for representing personality variation _within_ domains. For this reason, there are many
more facets (25) than domains (which compares to the 79 personality disorder criteria
in DSM-IV). One aim of the work group had been to condense this somewhat un-
wieldy number into a more manageable and reliable set of traits. Trait domains and
facets are rated on a 4-point dimensional scale, ranging from 0 (very little or not de-
scriptive at all) to 3 (extremely descriptive). Trait domains and their relevant trait fac-
ets are as follows:

- **Negative affectivity** (experiences negative emotions frequently and intensely):
    emotional lability, anxiousness, separation insecurity, perseveration, submissive-
    ness, hostility, depressivity, suspiciousness, (lack of) restricted affectivity
- **Detachment** (withdrawal from other people and from social interactions): re-
    stricted affectivity, depressivity, suspiciousness, withdrawal, anhedonia, intimacy
    avoidance
- **Antagonism** (engaging in behaviors that put the person at odds with other peo-
    ple): manipulativeness, deceitfulness, grandiosity, attention seeking, callousness,
    hostility
- **Disinhibition** (engaging in behaviors on impulse, without reflecting on potential
    future consequences): irresponsibility, impulsivity, distractibility, risk taking, (lack
    of) rigid perfectionism
- **Psychoticism** (unusual and bizarre experiences): unusual beliefs and experiences,
    eccentricity, cognitive and perceptual dysregulation


**452** DSM-5 Guidebook

The alternative model is designed to be flexible to suit the clinician’s needs and
interests. Clinicians can diagnose categorical personality disorders, diagnose person-
ality disorder—trait specified for individuals who do not meet one of the six specified
types, describe the heterogeneity at both the level of personality functioning and the
level of pathological traits within personality disorder types, or describe personality
trait profiles for all patients.

GENERAL CRITERIA FOR PERSONALITY DISORDER

A personality disorder diagnosis requires an assessment of level of personality im-
pairment in two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy
(Criterion A). The impairments must be “moderate or greater” as assessed with the
Level of Personality Functioning Scale (Table 21–1). Pathological personality traits
must be present that are disorder specific (Criterion B). The impairments in personal-
ity functioning and personality traits are relatively inflexible and pervasive across a
broad range of personal and social situations (Criterion C); relatively stable across
time, with onsets that can be traced back to at least adolescence or early adulthood
(Criterion D); not better accounted for by another mental disorder (Criterion E); not
attributable to the effects of a substance or of another medical condition (Criterion F);
and not better understood as normal for an individual’s developmental stage or so-
ciocultural environment (Criterion G).

General Criteria for Personality Disorder

The essential features of a personality disorder are

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality (self/interpersonal) functioning.
B. One or more pathological personality traits.
C. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual’s personality trait ex-
pression are relatively inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal
and social situations.
D. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual’s personality trait ex-
pression are relatively stable across time, with onsets that can be traced back to
at least adolescence or early adulthood.
E. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual’s personality trait ex-
pression are not better explained by another mental disorder.
F. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual’s personality trait ex-
pression are not solely attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or
another medical condition (e.g., severe head trauma).
G. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual’s personality trait ex-
pression are not better understood as normal for an individual’s developmental
stage or sociocultural environment.

All Section III personality disorders described by the criteria sets below also meet
the general definition.

SPECIFIC PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Section III includes diagnostic criteria for antisocial, avoidant, borderline, narcissistic,
obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal personality disorders. Each is defined by spe-
cific impairments in personality functioning (Criterion A) and characteristic patho-
logical personality traits (Criterion B).

Antisocial Personality Disorder

Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a failure to conform to lawful and
ethical behavior and/or an egocentric, callous lack of concern for others, accompa-
nied by deceitfulness, irresponsibility, manipulativeness, and/or risk taking.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Antisocial
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Egocentrism; self-esteem derived from personal gain, power, or plea-
    sure.
2. **Self-direction:** Goal setting based on personal gratification; absence of proso-
    cial internal standards, associated with failure to conform to lawful or culturally
    normative ethical behavior.
3. **Empathy:** Lack of concern for feelings, needs, or suffering of others; lack of re-
    morse after hurting or mistreating another.
4. **Intimacy:** Incapacity for mutually intimate relationships, as exploitation is a pri-
    mary means of relating to others, including by deceit and coercion; use of dom-
    inance or intimidation to control others.

B. Six or more of the following seven pathological personality traits:

1. **Manipulativeness** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Frequent use of subterfuge to
    influence or control others; use of seduction, charm, glibness, or ingratiation to
    achieve one’s ends.
2. **Callousness** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Lack of concern for feelings or prob-
    lems of others; lack of guilt or remorse about the negative or harmful effects of
    one’s actions on others; aggression; sadism.
3. **Deceitfulness** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Dishonesty and fraudulence; mis-
    representation of self; embellishment or fabrication when relating events.
4. **Hostility** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Persistent or frequent angry feelings; anger
    or irritability in response to minor slights and insults; mean, nasty, or vengeful be-
    havior.
5. **Risk taking** (an aspect of **Disinhibition** ): Engagement in dangerous, risky, and
    potentially self-damaging activities, unnecessarily and without regard for conse-
    quences; boredom proneness and thoughtless initiation of activities to counter


**458** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
boredom; lack of concern for one’s limitations and denial of the reality of personal
danger.
```
6. **Impulsivity** (an aspect of **Disinhibition** ): Acting on the spur of the moment in
    response to immediate stimuli; acting on a momentary basis without a plan or
    consideration of outcomes; difficulty establishing and following plans.
7. **Irresponsibility** (an aspect of **Disinhibition** ): Disregard for—and failure to
    honor—financial and other obligations or commitments; lack of respect for—
    and lack of follow-through on—agreements and promises.

**Note:** The individual is at least 18 years of age.

Specify if:
**With psychopathic features.**

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning
in two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. Individ-
uals with antisocial personality disorder may exhibit a notable egocentrism bordering
on grandiosity that may not be evident initially, and a concomitant sense of entitle-
ment and invulnerability (A1). Self-esteem may be disproportionately high, leading
to selfishness and overt or covert disregard for legal, moral, or cultural restrictions
(A2). These individuals may show a lack of concern for others’ feelings or needs or a
frank lack of remorse (A3). Sometimes a form of indifference or emotional detach-
ment emerges that is accompanied by the absence of empathy and inability to estab-
lish genuine intimacy (A4), although these characteristics may not be immediately
noticeable in everyday social transactions or during an initial assessment.

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of six or more of seven pathological personality traits.
These include manipulativeness (B1), which can manifest as the deliberate use of sub-
terfuge to control or influence others; callousness (B2), which can include lack of re-
morse or guilt and/or a lack of concern for the feelings of others; deceitfulness (B3),
manifested as dishonesty and fraudulence, as well as misrepresentation of self and also
embellishment and fabrication; hostility (B4), which includes persistent or frequent an-
gry feelings or vengeful behavior; risk taking (B5), which includes participating in risky
or dangerous behaviors; impulsivity (B6), which involves acting on the spur of the mo-
ment without regard for consequences; and irresponsibility (B7), which entails a disre-
gard for financial and other commitments.
The individual must be at least 18 years old. The specifier “with psychopathic fea-
tures” can be used to denote the presence of psychopathy, which describes a subset
of persons with antisocial personality disorder characterized by “a lack of anxiety or
fear and by a bold interpersonal style that may mask maladaptive behaviors” (Amer-
ican Psychiatric Association 2013, p. 765).


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **459**

Avoidant Personality Disorder

Typical features of avoidant personality disorder are the avoidance of social situa-
tions and inhibition in interpersonal relationships related to feelings of ineptitude
and inadequacy, anxious preoccupation with negative evaluation and rejection, and
fears of ridicule or embarrassment.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Avoidant
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Low self-esteem associated with self-appraisal as socially inept, per-
    sonally unappealing, or inferior; excessive feelings of shame.
2. **Self-direction:** Unrealistic standards for behavior associated with reluctance
    to pursue goals, take personal risks, or engage in new activities involving inter-
    personal contact.
3. **Empathy:** Preoccupation with, and sensitivity to, criticism or rejection, associ-
    ated with distorted inference of others’ perspectives as negative.
4. **Intimacy:** Reluctance to get involved with people unless being certain of being
    liked; diminished mutuality within intimate relationships because of fear of be-
    ing shamed or ridiculed.

B. Three or more of the following four pathological personality traits, one of which
must be (1) Anxiousness:

1. **Anxiousness** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Intense feelings of nervous-
    ness, tenseness, or panic, often in reaction to social situations; worry about the
    negative effects of past unpleasant experiences and future negative possibili-
    ties; feeling fearful, apprehensive, or threatened by uncertainty; fears of embar-
    rassment.
2. **Withdrawal** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Reticence in social situations; avoid-
    ance of social contacts and activity; lack of initiation of social contact.
3. **Anhedonia** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Lack of enjoyment from, engagement
    in, or energy for life’s experiences; deficits in the capacity to feel pleasure or
    take interest in things.
4. **Intimacy avoidance** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Avoidance of close or romantic
    relationships, interpersonal attachments, and intimate sexual relationships.

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning in
two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. Individuals
with avoidant personality disorder may have low self-esteem and see themselves as so-
cially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior and sometimes have excessive feelings
of shame or inadequacy (A1). These individuals may be averse to taking personal risk


**460** DSM-5 Guidebook

or engaging in new activities that involve interpersonal contact. This can lead them to
avoid engaging in anything new or challenging that is outside their comfort zone (A2).
They may be so preoccupied with the potential for negative social evaluation that they
find it difficult to empathize with the actual feelings or perspectives of others (A3). These
individuals may avoid even casual involvement with others and rarely develop close
personal relationships because of their conviction that anyone who came to know them
well would recognize their inadequacy and reject them (A4).

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of three or more of four items. Individuals with avoid-
ant personality disorder are often very anxious in social situations and worry about
the negative effects of past unpleasant experiences (B1). This may lead them to avoid
social situations or other activities that involve dealing with others. They may prefer
to spend time alone rather than with others, and may prefer to maintain emotional
distance from others and have minimal engagement with others when social contact
is necessary (B2). Avoidance extends to positive emotions as well. Individuals with
avoidant personality disorder may lack interest in and claim not to derive pleasure
from activities that most people do. They may see themselves as unenergetic and unen-
thusiastic, and they may acknowledge that they do not try to live full lives and do not
enjoy their day-to-day activities or even life itself (B3). Intimate relationships in par-
ticular are avoided. Such people may disavow interest in romantic attachments and
sexual relationships and often distance themselves from any relationship that begins
to get close (B4).

Borderline Personality Disorder

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by instability of self-image, personal
goals, interpersonal relationships, and affects, accompanied by impulsivity, risk-taking,
and/or hostility.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Borderline
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Markedly impoverished, poorly developed, or unstable self-image, of-
    ten associated with excessive self-criticism; chronic feelings of emptiness; dis-
    sociative states under stress.
2. **Self-direction:** Instability in goals, aspirations, values, or career plans.
3. **Empathy:** Compromised ability to recognize the feelings and needs of others as-
    sociated with interpersonal hypersensitivity (i.e., prone to feel slighted or in-
    sulted); perceptions of others selectively biased toward negative attributes or
    vulnerabilities.


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **461**

4. **Intimacy:** Intense, unstable, and conflicted close relationships, marked by mis-
    trust, neediness, and anxious preoccupation with real or imagined abandon-
    ment; close relationships often viewed in extremes of idealization and
    devaluation and alternating between overinvolvement and withdrawal.

B. Four or more of the following seven pathological personality traits, at least one of
which must be (5) Impulsivity, (6) Risk taking, or (7) Hostility:

1. **Emotional lability** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Unstable emotional ex-
    periences and frequent mood changes; emotions that are easily aroused, in-
    tense, and/or out of proportion to events and circumstances.
2. **Anxiousness** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Intense feelings of nervous-
    ness, tenseness, or panic, often in reaction to interpersonal stresses; worry
    about the negative effects of past unpleasant experiences and future negative
    possibilities; feeling fearful, apprehensive, or threatened by uncertainty; fears
    of falling apart or losing control.
3. **Separation insecurity** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Fears of rejection
    by—and/or separation from—significant others, associated with fears of exces-
    sive dependency and complete loss of autonomy.
4. **Depressivity** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Frequent feelings of being
    down, miserable, and/or hopeless; difficulty recovering from such moods;
    pessimism about the future; pervasive shame; feelings of inferior self-worth;
    thoughts of suicide and suicidal behavior.
5. **Impulsivity** (an aspect of **Disinhibition** ): Acting on the spur of the moment in
    response to immediate stimuli; acting on a momentary basis without a plan or
    consideration of outcomes; difficulty establishing or following plans; a sense of
    urgency and self-harming behavior under emotional distress.
6. **Risk taking** (an aspect of **Disinhibition** ): Engagement in dangerous, risky,
    and potentially self-damaging activities, unnecessarily and without regard to
    consequences; lack of concern for one’s limitations and denial of the reality of
    personal danger.
7. **Hostility** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Persistent or frequent angry feelings; an-
    ger or irritability in response to minor slights and insults.

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning
in two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. Individ-
uals with borderline personality disorder may have a markedly unstable and often
negative self-image (Criterion A1), with dramatic shifts in self-direction, including
goals, values, and aspirations (A2). These individuals are often interpersonally hy-
persensitive and have difficulty trusting others, yet they have an intolerance of being
alone. They may appear to have empathy for others, but the apparent empathy may
quickly evaporate if they feel their own needs are not being met (A3). Interpersonal re-
lationships are often unstable and intense. This may lead these individuals to overide-
alize romantic partners on the first or second meeting, leading to demands to spend
a lot of time together and to share the most intimate details of their own lives very
early in a relationship (A4).


**462** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of four or more of seven items, at least one of which
must be impulsivity, risk taking, or hostility. Individuals with borderline personality dis-
order may experience a marked affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood
that is out of proportion to actual events or circumstances (B1). These individuals may
experience intense feelings of anxiety, often in response to personal stresses (B2). They
often experience intense fears of rejection by or separation from significant others that
may be associated with significant despondency (B3). Dysphoric mood is common,
with frequent feelings of despair and hopelessness that may lead to suicidal thoughts
or behaviors (B4). Recurrent suicidality may be the reason these individuals seek help.
Individuals with this disorder are often impulsive, acting on the spur of the moment,
often in response to immediate stimuli (B5). This can lead them to abuse substances,
engage in unsafe sex, drive dangerously, or engage in other risky behaviors (B6). They
have difficulty controlling their anger and may display extreme sarcasm, bitterness,
or verbal outbursts, even in response to minor slights or insults (B7).

Narcissistic Personality Disorder

Narcissistic personality disorder is typically characterized by variable and vulnerable
self-esteem, with attempts at regulation through attention seeking and approval seek-
ing and either overt or covert grandiosity.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Narcissistic
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Excessive reference to others for self-definition and self-esteem reg-
    ulation; exaggerated self-appraisal inflated or deflated, or vacillating between
    extremes; emotional regulation mirrors fluctuations in self-esteem.
2. **Self-direction:** Goal setting based on gaining approval from others; personal
    standards unreasonably high in order to see oneself as exceptional, or too low
    based on a sense of entitlement; often unaware of own motivations.
3. **Empathy:** Impaired ability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs
    of others; excessively attuned to reactions of others, but only if perceived as
    relevant to self; over- or underestimation of own effect on others.
4. **Intimacy:** Relationships largely superficial and exist to serve self-esteem reg-
    ulation; mutuality constrained by little genuine interest in others’ experiences and
    predominance of a need for personal gain.

B. Both of the following pathological personality traits:

1. **Grandiosity** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Feelings of entitlement, either overt
    or covert; self-centeredness; firmly holding to the belief that one is better than
    others; condescension toward others.


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **463**

2. **Attention seeking** (an aspect of **Antagonism** ): Excessive attempts to attract
    and be the focus of the attention of others; admiration seeking.

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning in
two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. There may be a
pervasive sense of exaggerated self-importance and appraisal (A1). Individuals with this
disorder may exhibit a sense of entitlement (A2) and have little ability to recognize the
feelings of others (A3). Relationships may seem very superficial and self-serving (A4).

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of two pathological personality traits: grandiosity and
attention seeking. A core characteristic of individuals with narcissistic personality disor-
der is the regulation of self-esteem by resorting to grandiose strategies of overcompen-
sation, which may include feelings of entitlement, self-centeredness, and the belief that
one is better than others (B1). These individuals display an overreliance on seeking at-
tention and admiration from others or seeking to be the focus of attention by others (B2).

Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is typically characterized by difficulties
in establishing and sustaining close relationships, associated with a rigid perfection-
ism, inflexibility, and restricted emotional expression.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Sense of self derived predominantly from work or productivity; con-
    stricted experience and expression of strong emotions.
2. **Self-direction:** Difficulty completing tasks and realizing goals, associated with
    rigid and unreasonably high and inflexible internal standards of behavior;
    overly conscientious and moralistic attitudes.
3. **Empathy:** Difficulty understanding and appreciating the ideas, feelings, or be-
    haviors of others.
4. **Intimacy:** Relationships seen as secondary to work and productivity; rigidity
    and stubbornness negatively affect relationships with others.

B. Three or more of the following four pathological personality traits, one of which
must be (1) Rigid perfectionism:

1. **Rigid perfectionism** (an aspect of extreme Conscientiousness [the opposite
    pole of Detachment]): Rigid insistence on everything being flawless, perfect,


**464** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
and without errors or faults, including one’s own and others’ performance; sac-
rificing of timeliness to ensure correctness in every detail; believing that there
is only one right way to do things; difficulty changing ideas and/or viewpoint;
preoccupation with details, organization, and order.
```
2. **Perseveration** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity** ): Persistence at tasks long
    after the behavior has ceased to be functional or effective; continuance of the
    same behavior despite repeated failures.
3. **Intimacy avoidance** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Avoidance of close or ro-
    mantic relationships, interpersonal attachments, and intimate sexual relation-
    ships.
4. **Restricted affectivity** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Little reaction to emotion-
    ally arousing situations; constricted emotional experience and expression; in-
    difference or coldness.

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning
in two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. Individ-
uals with this disorder may have an excessive devotion to work or productivity, with
constricted expression of emotions (A1). These individuals may attempt to maintain
a sense of control through a rigid preoccupation with order and detail, to the extent
that the major goal of attempted activities is often not achieved (A2). They may have
difficulty understanding and appreciating the feelings of others (A3). These traits
may lead these individuals to value work and productivity over personal relationships,
which are viewed as of secondary importance (A4).

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of three or more of four items, one of which must be
rigid perfectionism. The individual may be overly focused on achieving perfection,
often believing that there is only one right way to do things (B1). Activities are often
overly methodical because the individual is overly concerned with time, punctuality,
schedules, and rules. The individual may persist at tasks despite repeated failures,
even when a behavior has ceased to be functional or effective (B2). The rigid approach
to tasks, problems, and people results in limited capacity to adapt to changing de-
mands or circumstances. The need to complete tasks perfectly may result in a paralysis
of indecision, such that important tasks may never be completed. These individuals
lack appreciation of the impact of their own behaviors on the thoughts and emotions
of other people, which may contribute to their avoidance or lack of romantic relation-
ships, friendships, or even sexual intimacy (B3, B4).

Schizotypal Personality Disorder

Schizotypal personality disorder is typically characterized by impairments in the ca-
pacity for social and close relationships and eccentricities in cognition, perception,


**_Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders_** **465**

and behavior that are associated with distorted self-image and incoherent personal
goals and accompanied by suspiciousness and restricted emotional expression.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Schizotypal
Personality Disorder

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by charac-
teristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity:** Confused boundaries between self and others; distorted self-concept;
    emotional expression often not congruent with context or internal experience.
2. **Self-direction:** Unrealistic or incoherent goals; no clear set of internal stan-
    dards.
3. **Empathy:** Pronounced difficulty understanding impact of own behaviors on
    others; frequent misinterpretations of others’ motivations and behaviors.
4. **Intimacy:** Marked impairments in developing close relationships, associated
    with mistrust and anxiety.

B. Four or more of the following six pathological personality traits:

1. **Cognitive and perceptual dysregulation** (an aspect of **Psychoticism** ): Odd
    or unusual thought processes; vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, over-
    elaborate, or stereotyped thought or speech; odd sensations in various sensory
    modalities.
2. **Unusual beliefs and experiences** (an aspect of **Psychoticism** ): Thought con-
    tent and views of reality that are viewed by others as bizarre or idiosyncratic;
    unusual experiences of reality.
3. **Eccentricity** (an aspect of **Psychoticism** ): Odd, unusual, or bizarre behavior
    or appearance; saying unusual or inappropriate things.
4. **Restricted affectivity** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Little reaction to emotion-
    ally arousing situations; constricted emotional experience and expression; in-
    difference or coldness.
5. **Withdrawal** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Preference for being alone to being
    with others; reticence in social situations; avoidance of social contacts and ac-
    tivity; lack of initiation of social contact.
6. **Suspiciousness** (an aspect of **Detachment** ): Expectations of—and height-
    ened sensitivity to—signs of interpersonal ill-intent or harm; doubts about loy-
    alty and fidelity of others; feelings of persecution.

Criterion A

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning
in two or more of four areas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. Individ-
uals with schizotypal personality disorder may have confused boundaries between
self and others, distorted self-concept, and emotional expression that is not congruent
with context or internal experience (A1). Impairments in self-direction include unre-
alistic or incoherent goals and having no clear set of internal standards (A2). Problems


**466** DSM-5 Guidebook

with empathy may include pronounced difficulty understanding the impact of their
own behaviors on others and misinterpretations of others’ motivations and behaviors
(A3). Problems with intimacy may include marked impairments in developing close
relationships, associated with mistrust and anxiety (A4).

Criterion B

This item requires endorsement of four or more of six items. Individuals with schizo-
typal personality disorder often have pronounced pathological personality traits in
the area of psychoticism because they are prone to psychotic-like experiences such as
having unusual thought processes or magical beliefs or they may display vague or di-
gressive speech (B1, B2). These individuals are considered by others to be odd or eccen-
tric, and they may display bizarre behaviors or make odd statements (B3). Restricted
affectivity can be of concern, and the individual may have little reaction to emotion-
ally stimulating events (B4). Social withdrawal is common; the individual displays
reticence in social situations or simply prefers to be alone (B5). Suspiciousness is com-
monly experienced. The individual may be hypervigilant and suspect others as hav-
ing negative or harmful intentions toward him or her (B6).

Personality Disorder—Trait Specified

Personality disorder—trait specified replaces the DSM-IV diagnosis personality dis-
order not otherwise specified. This is a residual category for persons with personality
disorders that do not meet criteria for one of the specific disorders. Rather than leav-
ing the nature of the personality disorder unspecified, the clinician can specify the in-
dividual’s personality disorder. Both the personality domain and trait facet levels
allow a detailed assessment of the individual’s personality features. For example, two
people may be similar because they both have extreme disinhibition, but they may
differ in that only one of them also manifests psychoticism with unusual beliefs and
experiences.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Personality Disorder—
Trait Specified

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by difficul-
ties in two or more of the following four areas:

1. **Identity**
2. **Self-direction**
3. **Empathy**
4. **Intimacy**

B. One or more pathological personality trait domains OR specific trait facets within
domains, considering ALL of the following domains:

1. **Negative Affectivity** (vs. Emotional Stability): Frequent and intense experi-
    ences of high levels of a wide range of negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, de-

pression, guilt/shame, worry, anger), and their behavioral (e.g., self-harm) and
interpersonal (e.g., dependency) manifestations.
```
2. **Detachment** (vs. Extraversion): Avoidance of socioemotional experience, in-
    cluding both withdrawal from interpersonal interactions, ranging from casual,
    daily interactions to friendships to intimate relationships, as well as restricted
    affective experience and expression, particularly limited hedonic capacity.
3. **Antagonism** (vs. Agreeableness): Behaviors that put the individual at odds
    with other people, including an exaggerated sense of self-importance and a
    concomitant expectation of special treatment, as well as a callous antipathy to-
    ward others, encompassing both unawareness of others’ needs and feelings,
    and a readiness to use others in the service of self-enhancement.
4. **Disinhibition** (vs. Conscientiousness): Orientation toward immediate gratifi-
    cation, leading to impulsive behavior driven by current thoughts, feelings, and
    external stimuli, without regard for past learning or consideration of future con-
    sequences.
5. **Psychoticism** (vs. Lucidity): Exhibiting a wide range of culturally incongruent
    odd, eccentric, or unusual behaviors and cognitions, including both process
    (e.g., perception, dissociation) and content (e.g., beliefs).

Criteria A and B

The individual must have moderate or greater impairment in two or more of four ar-
eas: identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy (Criterion A). The clinician should
endorse one or more of five pathological trait domains or specific trait facets within
domains (Criterion B). This approach allows the clinician to take a broad perspective
and record the person’s prominent maladaptive personality features. He or she can
simply record which of the five personality trait domains characterize an individual,
or choose to specify more detailed features and record which of the trait facets (within
the domains) are most characteristic. The decision to use this category depends on the
needs of the clinical situation.
