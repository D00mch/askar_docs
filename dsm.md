[]{#index_split_004.html#p42}**Preface**

The American Psychiatric Association's *Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of* *Mental Disorders* (DSM) is a classification of mental
disorders with associated criteria designed to facilitate more reliable
diagnoses of these disorders. With successive editions over the past 60
years, it has become a standard reference for clinical practice in the
mental health field. Since a complete description of the underlying
pathological processes is not possible for most mental disorders, it is
important to emphasize that the current diagnostic criteria are the best
available description of how mental disorders are expressed and can be
recognized by trained clinicians. DSM is intended to serve as a
practical, functional, and flexible guide for organizing information
that can aid in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of mental
disorders. It is a tool for clinicians, an essential educational
resource for students and practitioners, and a reference for researchers
in the field.

Although this edition of DSM was designed first and foremost to be a
useful guide to clinical practice, as an official nomenclature it must
be applicable in a wide diversity of contexts. DSM has been used by
clinicians and researchers from different orientations (biological,
psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, family/systems),
all of whom strive for a common language to communicate the essential
characteristics of mental disorders presented by their patients. The
information is of value to all professionals associated with various
aspects of mental health care, including psychiatrists, other
physicians, psychologists, social workers, nurses, counselors, forensic
and legal specialists, occupational and rehabilitation therapists, and
other health professionals. The criteria are concise and explicit and
intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations
in a variety of clinical settings---inpatient, outpatient, partial
hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary
care---as well in general community epidemiological studies of mental
disorders. DSM-5 is also a tool for collecting and communicating
accurate public health statistics on mental disorder morbidity and
mortality rates. Finally, the criteria and corresponding text serve as a
textbook for students early in their profession who need a structured
way to understand and diagnose mental disorders as well as for seasoned
professionals encountering rare disorders for the first time.
Fortu-nately, all of these uses are mutually compatible.

These diverse needs and interests were taken into consideration in
planning DSM-5.

The classification of disorders is harmonized with the World Health
Organization's *International Classification of Diseases* (ICD), the
official coding system used in the United States, so that the DSM
criteria define disorders identified by ICD diagnostic names and code
numbers. In DSM-5, both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes (the latter
scheduled for adoption in October 2014) are attached to the relevant
disorders in the classification.

Although DSM-5 remains a categorical classification of separate
disorders, we recognize that mental disorders do not always fit
completely within the boundaries of a single disorder. Some symptom
domains, such as depression and anxiety, involve multiple diagnostic
categories and may reflect common underlying vulnerabilities for a
larger group of disorders. In recognition of this reality, the disorders
included in DSM-5 were reordered into a revised organizational structure
meant to stimulate new clinical perspectives. This new structure
corresponds with the organizational arrangement of disorders planned for
ICD-11 scheduled for release in 2015. Other enhancements have been
introduced to promote ease of use across all settings: **xli**

## Preface {#index_split_005.html#calibre_pb_4 .calibre3}

• **Representation of developmental issues related to diagnosis.** The
change in chapter organization better reflects a lifespan approach, with
disorders more frequently diagnosed in childhood (e.g.,
neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual and
disorders more applicable to older adulthood (e.g., neurocognitive
disorders) at the end of the manual. Also, within the text, subheadings
on development and course provide descriptions of how disorder
presentations may change across the lifespan.

Age-related factors specific to diagnosis (e.g., symptom presentation
and prevalence differences in certain age groups) are also included in
the text. For added emphasis, these age-related factors have been added
to the criteria themselves where applicable (e.g., in the criteria sets
for insomnia disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, specific
criteria describe how symptoms might be expressed in children).
Likewise, gender and cultural issues have been integrated into the
disorders where applicable.

• **Integration of scientific findings from the latest research in
genetics and neuroimaging.** The revised chapter structure was informed
by recent research in neuroscience and by emerging genetic linkages
between diagnostic groups. Genetic and physiological risk factors,
prognostic indicators, and some putative diagnostic markers are
highlighted in the text. This new structure should improve clinicians'
ability to identify diagnoses in a disorder spectrum based on common
neurocircuitry, genetic vulnerability, and environmental exposures.

• **Consolidation of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and
pervasive developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder.**
Symptoms of these disorders represent a single continuum of mild to
severe impairments in the two domains of social communication and
restrictive repetitive behaviors/interests rather than being distinct
disorders. This change is designed to improve the sensitivity and
specificity of the criteria for the diagnosis of autism spectrum
disorder and to identify more focused treatment targets for the specific
impairments identified.

• **Streamlined classification of bipolar and depressive disorders.**
Bipolar and depressive disorders are the most commonly diagnosed
conditions in psychiatry. It was therefore important to streamline the
presentation of these disorders to enhance both clinical and educational
use. Rather than separating the definition of manic, hypomanic, and
major depressive episodes from the definition of bipolar I disorder,
bipolar II disorder, and major depressive disorder as in the previous
edition, we included all of the component criteria within the respective
criteria for each disorder. This approach will facilitate bedside
diagnosis and treatment of these important disorders. Likewise, the
explanatory notes for differentiating bereavement and major depressive
disorders will provide far greater clinical guidance than was previously
provided in the simple bereavement exclusion criterion. The new
specifiers of anxious distress and mixed features are now fully
described in the narrative on specifier variations that accompanies the
criteria for these disorders.

• **Restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and
clarity.** The categories of substance abuse and substance dependence
have been eliminated and replaced with an overarching new category of
substance use disorders---with the specific substance used defining the
specific disorders. "Dependence" has been easily confused with the term
"addiction" when, in fact, the tolerance and withdrawal that previously
defined dependence are actually very normal responses to prescribed
medications that affect the central nervous system and do not
necessarily indicate the presence of an addiction.

By revising and clarifying these criteria in DSM-5, we hope to alleviate
some of the widespread misunderstanding about these issues.

• **Enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders.**
Given the explo-sion in neuroscience, neuropsychology, and brain imaging
over the past 20 years, it was critical to convey the current
state-of-the-art in the diagnosis of specific types of disorders that
were previously referred to as the "dementias" or organic brain
diseases. Biological markers identified by imaging for vascular and
traumatic brain disorders and []{#index_split_005.html#p44}Preface

**xliii**

specific molecular genetic findings for rare variants of Alzheimer's
disease and Huntington's disease have greatly advanced clinical
diagnoses, and these disorders and others have now been separated into
specific subtypes.

• **Transition in conceptualizing personality disorders.** Although the
benefits of a more dimensional approach to personality disorders have
been identified in previous editions, the transition from a categorical
diagnostic system of individual disorders to one based on the relative
distribution of personality traits has not been widely accepted. In
DSM-5, the categorical personality disorders are virtually unchanged
from the previous edition. However, an alternative "hybrid" model has
been proposed in Section III to guide future research that separates
interpersonal functioning assessments and the expression of pathological
personality traits for six specific disorders. A more dimensional
profile of personality trait expression is also proposed for a
trait-specified approach.

• **Section III: new disorders and features.** A new section (Section
III) has been added to highlight disorders that require further study
but are not sufficiently well established to be a part of the official
classification of mental disorders for routine clinical use. Dimensional
measures of symptom severity in 13 symptom domains have also been
incorporated to allow for the measurement of symptom levels of varying
severity across all diagnostic groups. Likewise, the WHO Disability
Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), a standard method for assessing global
disability levels for mental disorders that is based on the
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)
and is applicable in all of medicine, has been provided to replace the
more limited Global Assessment of Functioning scale. It is our hope that
as these measures are implemented over time, they will provide greater
accuracy and flexibility in the clinical description of individual
symptomatic presentations and associated disability during diagnostic
assessments.

• **Online enhancements.** DSM-5 features online supplemental
information.

Additional cross-cutting and diagnostic severity measures are available
online (www.psychiatry.org/dsm5), linked to the relevant disorders. In
addition, the Cultural Formulation Interview, Cultural Formulation
Interview---Informant Version, and supplementary modules to the core
Cultural Formulation Interview are also included online at
www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

These innovations were designed by the leading authorities on mental
disorders in the world and were implemented on the basis of their expert
review, public commentary, and independent peer review. The 13 work
groups, under the direction of the DSM-5 Task Force, in conjunction with
other review bodies and, eventually, the APA Board of Trustees,
collectively represent the global expertise of the specialty. This
effort was supported by an extensive base of advisors and by the
professional staff of the APA Division of Research; the names of
everyone involved are too numerous to mention here but are listed in the
Appendix. We owe tremendous thanks to those who devoted countless hours
and in-valuable expertise to this effort to improve the diagnosis of
mental disorders.

We would especially like to acknowledge the chairs, text coordinators,
and members of the 13 work groups, listed in the front of the manual,
who spent many hours in this volunteer effort to improve the scientific
basis of clinical practice over a sustained 6-year period. Susan K.
Schultz, M.D., who served as text editor, worked tirelessly with Emily
A.

Kuhl, Ph.D., senior science writer and DSM-5 staff text editor, to
coordinate the efforts of the work groups into a cohesive whole. William
E. Narrow, M.D., M.P.H., led the research group that developed the
overall research strategy for DSM-5, including the field trials, that
greatly enhanced the evidence base for this revision. In addition, we
are grateful to those who contributed so much time to the independent
review of the revision proposals, including Kenneth S. Kendler, M.D.,
and Robert Freedman, M.D., co-chairs of the Scientific Review Committee;
John S. McIntyre, M.D., and Joel Yager, M.D., co-chairs of the Clinical
and Public Health Committee; and Glenn Martin, M.D., chair of the APA

her expert statistical consultation; Michael B. First, M.D., for his
valuable input on the coding and review of criteria; and Paul S.
Appelbaum, M.D., for feedback on forensic issues. Maria N. Ward, M.Ed.,
RHIT, CCS-P, also helped in verifying all ICD coding. The Summit Group,
which included these consultants, the chairs of all review groups, the
task force chairs, and the APA executive officers, chaired by Dilip V.
Jeste, M.D., provided leadership and vision in helping to achieve
compromise and consensus. This level of commitment has contributed to
the balance and objectivity that we feel are hallmarks of DSM-5.

We especially wish to recognize the outstanding APA Division of Research
staff---

identified in the Task Force and Work Group listing at the front of this
manual---who worked tirelessly to interact with the task force, work
groups, advisors, and reviewers to resolve issues, serve as liaisons
between the groups, direct and manage the academic and routine clinical
practice field trials, and record decisions in this important process.
In particular, we appreciate the support and guidance provided by James
H. Scully Jr., M.D., Medical Director and CEO of the APA, through the
years and travails of the development process. Finally, we thank the
editorial and production staff of American Psychiatric
Publishing---specifically, Rebecca Rinehart, Publisher; John McDuffie,
Editorial Director; Ann Eng, Senior Editor; Greg Kuny, Managing Editor;
and Tammy Cordova, Graphics Design Manager---for their guidance in
bringing this all together and creating the final product. It is the
culmination of efforts of many talented individuals who dedicated their
time, expertise, and passion that made DSM-5 possible.

[]{#index_split_006.html#p48}This section is a basic orientation to the
purpose, structure, content, and use of DSM-5. It is not intended to
provide an exhaustive account of the evolution of DSM-5, but rather to
give readers a succinct overview of its key elements. The introductory
section describes the public, professional, and expert review process
that was used to extensively evaluate the diagnostic criteria presented
in Section II. A summary of the DSM-5 structure, harmonization with
ICD-11, and the transition to a nonaxial system with a new approach to
assessing disability is also presented. "Use of the Manual" includes
"Definition of a Mental Disorder," forensic considerations, and a brief
overview of the diagnostic process and use of coding and recording
procedures.

[]{#index_split_006.html#p50}**Introduction**

The creation of the fifth edition of *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders* (DSM-5) was a massive undertaking that involved
hundreds of people working toward a common goal over a 12-year process.
Much thought and deliberation were involved in evaluating the diagnostic
criteria, considering the organization of every aspect of the manual,
and creating new features believed to be most useful to clinicians. All
of these efforts were directed toward the goal of enhancing the clinical
usefulness of DSM-5 as a guide in the diagnosis of mental disorders.

Reliable diagnoses are essential for guiding treatment recommendations,
identifying prevalence rates for mental health service planning,
identifying patient groups for clinical and basic research, and
documenting important public health information such as morbidity and
mortality rates. As the understanding of mental disorders and their
treatments has evolved, medical, scientific, and clinical professionals
have focused on the characteristics of specific disorders and their
implications for treatment and research.

While DSM has been the cornerstone of substantial progress in
reliability, it has been well recognized by both the American
Psychiatric Association (APA) and the broad scientific community working
on mental disorders that past science was not mature enough to yield
fully validated diagnoses---that is, to provide consistent, strong, and
objective scientific validators of individual DSM disorders. The science
of mental disorders continues to evolve. However, the last two decades
since DSM-IV was released have seen real and durable progress in such
areas as cognitive neuroscience, brain imaging, epidemiology, and
genetics. The DSM-5 Task Force overseeing the new edition recognized
that research advances will require careful, iterative changes if DSM is
to maintain its place as the touchstone classification of mental
disorders. Finding the right balance is critical. Speculative results do
not belong in an official nosology, but at the same time, DSM must
evolve in the context of other clinical research initiatives in the
field. One important aspect of this transition derives from the broad
recognition that a too-rigid categorical system does not capture
clinical experience or important scientific observations. The results of
numerous studies of comorbidity and disease transmission in families,
including twin studies and molecular genetic studies, make strong
arguments for what many astute clinicians have long observed: the
boundaries between many disorder "categories" are more fluid over the
life course than DSM-IV recognized, and many symptoms assigned to a
single disorder may occur, at varying levels of severity, in many other
disorders.

These findings mean that DSM, like other medical disease
classifications, should accommodate ways to introduce dimensional
approaches to mental disorders, including dimensions that cut across
current categories. Such an approach should permit a more accurate
description of patient presentations and increase the validity of a
diagnosis (i.e., the degree to which diagnostic criteria reflect the
comprehensive manifestation of an underlying psychopathological
disorder). DSM-5 is designed to better fill the need of clinicians,
patients, families, and researchers for a clear and concise description
of each mental disorder organized by explicit diagnostic criteria,
supplemented, when appropriate, by dimensional measures that cross
diagnostic boundaries, and a brief digest of information about the
diagnosis, risk factors, associated features, research advances, and
various expressions of the disorder.

Clinical training and experience are needed to use DSM for determining a
diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors,
cognitive functions, personality traits, physical signs, syndrome
combinations, and durations that require clinical expertise to
differentiate from normal life variation and transient responses to
stress. To facilitate a thorough **5**

## Introduction {#index_split_007.html#calibre_pb_6 .calibre3}

examination of the range of symptoms present, DSM can serve clinicians
as a guide to identify the most prominent symptoms that should be
assessed when diagnosing a disorder. Although some mental disorders may
have well-defined boundaries around symptom clusters, scientific
evidence now places many, if not most, disorders on a spectrum with
closely related disorders that have shared symptoms, shared genetic and
environmental risk factors, and possibly shared neural substrates
(perhaps most strongly established for a subset of anxiety disorders by
neuroimaging and animal models). In short, we have come to recognize
that the boundaries between disorders are more porous than originally
perceived.

Many health profession and educational groups have been involved in the
development and testing of DSM-5, including physicians, psychologists,
social workers, nurses, counselors, epidemiologists, statisticians,
neuroscientists, and neuropsychologists. Finally, patients, families,
lawyers, consumer organizations, and advocacy groups have all
participated in revising DSM-5 by providing feedback on the mental
disorders described in this volume. Their monitoring of the descriptions
and explanatory text is essential to improve understanding, reduce
stigma, and advance the treatment and eventual cures for these
conditions.

A Brief History

The APA first published a predecessor of DSM in 1844, as a statistical
classification of institutionalized mental patients. It was designed to
improve communication about the types of patients cared for in these
hospitals. This forerunner to DSM also was used as a component of the
full U.S. census. After World War II, DSM evolved through four major
editions into a diagnostic classification system for psychiatrists,
other physicians, and other mental health professionals that described
the essential features of the full range of mental disorders. The
current edition, DSM-5, builds on the goal of its predecessors (most
recently, DSM-IV-TR, or Text Revision, published in 2000) of providing
guidelines for diagnoses that can inform treatment and management
decisions.

DSM-5 Revision Process

In 1999, the APA launched an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses
of DSM based on emerging research that did not support the boundaries
established for some mental disorders. This effort was coordinated with
the World Health Organization (WHO) Division of Mental Health, the World
Psychiatric Association, and the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH) in the form of several conferences, the proceedings of which were
published in 2002 in a monograph entitled *A Research Agenda for DSM-V.*
Thereafter, from 2003 to 2008, a cooperative agreement with the APA and
the WHO was supported by the NIMH, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA), and the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse
(NIAAA) to convene 13 international DSM-5 research planning conferences,
involving 400 participants from 39 countries, to review the world
literature in specific diagnostic areas to prepare for revisions in
developing both DSM-5 and the *International Classification of
Diseases,* 11th Revision (ICD-11). Reports from these conferences formed
the basis for future DSM-5 Task Force reviews and set the stage for the
new edition of DSM.

In 2006, the APA named David J. Kupfer, M.D., as Chair and Darrel A.
Regier, M.D., M.P.H., as Vice-Chair of the DSM-5 Task Force. They were
charged with recommending chairs for the 13 diagnostic work groups and
additional task force members with a multidisciplinary range of
expertise who would oversee the development of DSM-5. An additional
vetting process was initiated by the APA Board of Trustees to disclose
sources of income and thus avoid conflicts of interest by task force and
work group members. The full disclosure of all income and research
grants from commercial sources, including the pharmaceutical industry,
in the previous 3 years, the imposition of an income cap from all
commercial sources, and the publication of disclosures on a Web site set
a new standard for the []{#index_split_007.html#p52}Introduction

field. Thereafter, the task force of 28 members was approved in 2007,
and appointments of more than 130 work group members were approved in
2008. More than 400 additional work group advisors with no voting
authority were also approved to participate in the process. A clear
concept of the next evolutionary stage for the classification of mental
disorders was central to the efforts of the task force and the work
groups. This vision emerged as the task force and work groups recounted
the history of DSM-IV's classification, its current strengths and
limitations, and strategic directions for its revision. An intensive
6-year process involved conducting literature reviews and secondary
analyses, publishing research reports in scientific journals, developing
draft diagnostic criteria, posting preliminary drafts on the DSM-5 Web
site for public comment, presenting preliminary findings at professional
meetings, performing field trials, and revising criteria and text.

Proposals for Revisions

Proposals for the revision of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria were developed
by members of the work groups on the basis of rationale, scope of
change, expected impact on clinical management and public health,
strength of the supporting research evidence, overall clarity, and
clinical utility. Proposals encompassed changes to diagnostic criteria;
the addition of new disorders, subtypes, and specifiers; and the
deletion of existing disorders.

In the proposals for revisions, strengths and weaknesses in the current
criteria and nosology were first identified. Novel scientific findings
over the previous two decades were considered, leading to the creation
of a research plan to assess potential changes through literature
reviews and secondary data analyses. Four principles guided the draft
revisions: 1) DSM-5 is primarily intended to be a manual to be used by
clinicians, and revisions must be feasible for routine clinical
practice; 2) recommendations for revisions should be guided by research
evidence; 3) where possible, continuity should be maintained with
previous editions of DSM; and 4) no a priori constraints should be
placed on the degree of change between DSM-IV and DSM-5.

Building on the initial literature reviews, work groups identified key
issues within their diagnostic areas. Work groups also examined broader
methodological concerns, such as the presence of contradictory findings
within the literature; development of a refined definition of mental
disorder; cross-cutting issues relevant to all disorders; and the
revision of disorders categorized in DSM-IV as "not otherwise
specified." Inclusion of a proposal for revision in Section II was
informed by consideration of its advantages and disadvantages for public
health and clinical utility, the strength of the evidence, and the
magnitude of the change. New diagnoses and disorder subtypes and
specifiers were subject to additional stipulations, such as
demonstration of reliability (i.e., the degree to which two clinicians
could independently arrive at the same diagnosis for a given patient).
Disorders with low clinical utility and weak validity were considered
for deletion. Placement of conditions in "Conditions for Further Study"
in Section III was contingent on the amount of empirical evidence
generated on the diagnosis, diagnostic reliability or validity, presence
of clear clinical need, and potential benefit in advancing research.

DSM-5 Field Trials

The use of field trials to empirically demonstrate reliability was a
noteworthy improvement introduced in DSM-III. The design and
implementation strategy of the DSM-5 Field Trials represent several
changes over approaches used for DSM-III and DSM-IV, particularly in
obtaining data on the precision of kappa reliability estimates (a
statistical measure that assesses level of agreement between raters that
corrects for chance agreement due to prevalence rates) in the context of
clinical settings with high levels of diagnostic comorbidity. For DSM-5,
field trials were extended by using two distinctive designs: one in
large, diverse medical-academic settings, and the other in routine
clinical practices. The former capitalized on the need for large sample
sizes to test hypotheses on reliability and clinical utility of a range
of diagnoses in a []{#index_split_007.html#p53}**8**

[]{#index_split_008.html}

## Introduction {#index_split_008.html#calibre_pb_7 .calibre3}

variety of patient populations; the latter supplied valuable information
about how proposed revisions performed in everyday clinical settings
among a diverse sample of DSM users. It is anticipated that future
clinical and basic research studies will focus on the validity of the
revised categorical diagnostic criteria and the underlying dimensional
features of these disorders (including those now being explored by the
NIMH Research Domain Criteria initiative).

The medical-academic field trials were conducted at 11 North American
medical-academic sites and assessed the reliability, feasibility, and
clinical utility of select revisions, with priority given to those that
represented the greatest degree of change from DSM-IV or those
potentially having the greatest public health impact. The full clinical
patient populations coming to each site were screened for DSM-IV
diagnoses or qualifying symptoms likely to predict several specific
DSM-5 disorders of interest. Stratified samples of four to seven
specific disorders, plus a stratum containing a representative sample of
all other diagnoses, were identified for each site.

Patients consented to the study and were randomly assigned for a
clinical interview by a clinician blind to the diagnosis, followed by a
second interview with a clinician blind to previous diagnoses. Patients
first filled out a computer-assisted inventory of cross-cutting symptoms
in more than a dozen psychological domains. These inventories were
scored by a central server, and results were provided to clinicians
before they conducted a typical clinical interview (with no structured
protocol). Clinicians were required to score the presence of qualifying
criteria on a computer-assisted DSM-5 diagnostic checklist, determine
diagnoses, score the severity of the diagnosis, and submit all data to
the central Web-based server. This study design allowed the calculation
of the degree to which two independent clinicians could agree on a
diagnosis (using the intraclass kappa statistic) and the agreement of a
single patient or two different clinicians on two separate ratings of
cross-cutting symptoms, personality traits, disability, and diagnostic
severity measures (using intraclass correlation coefficients) along with
information on the precision of these estimates of reliability. It was
also possible to assess the prevalence rates of both DSM-IV and DSM-5
conditions in the respective clinical populations.

The routine clinical practice field trials involved recruitment of
individual psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians. A volunteer
sample was recruited that included gener-alist and specialty
psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers,
counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice
psychiatric mental health nurses.

The field trials provided exposure of the proposed DSM-5 diagnoses and
dimensional measures to a wide range of clinicians to assess their
feasibility and clinical utility.

Public and Professional Review

In 2010, the APA launched a unique Web site to facilitate public and
professional input into DSM-5. All draft diagnostic criteria and
proposed changes in organization were posted on www.dsm5.org for a
2-month comment period. Feedback totaled more than 8,000 submissions,
which were systematically reviewed by each of the 13 work groups, whose
members, where appropriate, integrated questions and comments into
discussions of draft revisions and plans for field trial testing. After
revisions to the initial draft criteria and proposed chapter
organization, a second posting occurred in 2011. Work groups considered
feedback from both Web postings and the results of the DSM-5 Field
Trials when drafting proposed final criteria, which were posted on the
Web site for a third and final time in 2012. These three iterations of
external review produced more than 13,000 individually signed comments
on the Web site that were received and reviewed by the work groups, plus
thousands of organized petition signers for and against some proposed
revisions, all of which allowed the task force to actively address
concerns of DSM users, as well as patients and advocacy groups, and
ensure that clinical utility remained a high priority.

Expert Review

The members of the 13 work groups, representing expertise in their
respective areas, collaborated with advisors and reviewers under the
overall direction of the DSM-5 Task

Force to draft the diagnostic criteria and accompanying text. This
effort was supported by a team of APA Division of Research staff and
developed through a network of text coordinators from each work group.
The preparation of the text was coordinated by the text editor, working
in close collaboration with the work groups and under the direction of
the task force chairs. The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) was
established to provide a scientific peer review process that was
external to that of the work groups. The SRC chair, vice-chair, and six
committee members were charged with reviewing the degree to which the
proposed changes from DSM-IV could be supported with scientific
evidence. Each proposal for diagnostic revision required a memorandum of
evidence for change prepared by the work group and accompanied by a
summary of supportive data organized around validators for the proposed
diagnostic criteria (i.e., antecedent validators such as familial
aggregation, concurrent validators such as biological markers, and
prospective validators such as response to treatment or course of
illness). The submissions were reviewed by the SRC and scored according
to the strength of the supportive scientific data.

Other justifications for change, such as those arising from clinical
experience or need or from a conceptual reframing of diagnostic
categories, were generally seen as outside the purview of the SRC. The
reviewers' scores, which varied substantially across the different
proposals, and an accompanying brief commentary were then returned to
the APA Board of Trustees and the work groups for consideration and
response.

The Clinical and Public Health Committee (CPHC), composed of a chair,
vice-chair, and six members, was appointed to consider additional
clinical utility, public health, and logical clarification issues for
criteria that had not yet accumulated the type or level of evidence
deemed sufficient for change by the SRC. This review process was
particularly important for DSM-IV disorders with known deficiencies for
which proposed remedies had neither been previously considered in the
DSM revision process nor been subjected to replicated research studies.
These selected disorders were evaluated by four to five external
reviewers, and the blinded results were reviewed by CPHC members, who in
turn made recommendations to the APA Board of Trustees and the work
groups.

Forensic reviews by the members of the APA Council on Psychiatry and Law
were conducted for disorders frequently appearing in forensic
environments and ones with high potential for influencing civil and
criminal judgments in courtroom settings. Work groups also added
forensic experts as advisors in pertinent areas to complement expertise
provided by the Council on Psychiatry and Law.

The work groups themselves were charged with the responsibility to
review the entire research literature surrounding a diagnostic area,
including old, revised, and new diagnostic criteria, in an intensive
6-year review process to assess the pros and cons of making either small
iterative changes or major conceptual changes to address the inevitable
reification that occurs with diagnostic conceptual approaches that
persist over several decades. Such changes included the merger of
previously separate diagnostic areas into more dimensional spectra, such
as that which occurred with autism spectrum disorder, substance use
disorders, sexual dysfunctions, and somatic symptom and related
disorders. Other changes included correcting flaws that had become
apparent over time in the choice of operational criteria for some
disorders. These types of changes posed particular challenges to the SRC
and CPHC review processes, which were not constructed to evaluate the
validity of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.

However, the DSM-5 Task Force, which had reviewed proposed changes and
had responsibility for reviewing the text describing each disorder
contemporaneously with the work groups during this period, was in a
unique position to render an informed judgment on the scientific merits
of such revisions. Furthermore, many of these major changes were subject
to field trial testing, although comprehensive testing of all proposed
changes could not be accommodated by such testing because of time
limitations and availability of resources.

A final recommendation from the task force was then provided to the APA
Board of Trustees and the APA Assembly's Committee on DSM-5 to consider
some of the clinical utility and feasibility features of the proposed
revisions. The assembly is a deliberative

[]{#index_split_008.html#p55}**10**

## Introduction {#index_split_009.html#calibre_pb_8 .calibre3}

body of the APA representing the district branches and wider membership
that is composed of psychiatrists from throughout the United States who
provide geographic, practice size, and interest-based diversity. The
Committee on DSM-5 is a committee made up of a diverse group of assembly
leaders.

Following all of the preceding review steps, an executive "summit
committee" session was held to consolidate input from review and
assembly committee chairs, task force chairs, a forensic advisor, and a
statistical advisor, for a preliminary review of each disorder by the
assembly and APA Board of Trustees executive committees. This preceded a
preliminary review by the full APA Board of Trustees. The assembly
voted, in November 2012, to recommend that the board approve the
publication of DSM-5, and the APA Board of Trustees approved its
publication in December 2012. The many experts, reviewers, and advisors
who contributed to this process are listed in the Appendix.

Organizational Structure

The individual disorder definitions that constitute the operationalized
sets of diagnostic criteria provide the core of DSM-5 for clinical and
research purposes. These criteria have been subjected to scientific
review, albeit to varying degrees, and many disorders have undergone
field testing for interrater reliability. In contrast, the
classification of disorders (the way in which disorders are grouped,
which provides a high-level organization for the manual) has not
generally been thought of as scientifically significant, despite the
fact that judgments had to be made when disorders were initially divided
into chapters for DSM-III.

DSM is a medical classification of disorders and as such serves as a
historically determined cognitive schema imposed on clinical and
scientific information to increase its com-prehensibility and utility.
Not surprisingly, as the foundational science that ultimately led to
DSM-III has approached a half-century in age, challenges have begun to
emerge for clinicians and scientists alike that are inherent in the DSM
structure rather than in the description of any single disorder. These
challenges include high rates of comorbidity within and across DSM
chapters, an excessive use of and need to rely on "not otherwise
specified"

(NOS) criteria, and a growing inability to integrate DSM disorders with
the results of genetic studies and other scientific findings.

As the APA and the WHO began to plan their respective revisions of the
DSM and the *International Classification of Disorders* (ICD), both
considered the possibility of improving clinical utility (e.g., by
helping to explain apparent comorbidity) and facilitating scientific
investigation by rethinking the organizational structures of both
publications in a linear system designated by alphanumeric codes that
sequence chapters according to some rational and relational structure.
It was critical to both the DSM-5 Task Force and the WHO

International Advisory Group on the revision of the ICD-10 Section on
Mental and Behavioral Disorders that the revisions to the organization
enhance clinical utility and remain within the bounds of well-replicated
scientific information. Although the need for reform seemed apparent, it
was important to respect the state of the science as well as the
challenge that overly rapid change would pose for the clinical and
research communities. In that spirit, revision of the organization was
approached as a conservative, evolutionary diagnostic reform that would
be guided by emerging scientific evidence on the relationships between
disorder groups. By reordering and regrouping the existing disorders,
the revised structure is meant to stimulate new clinical perspectives
and to encourage researchers to identify the psychological and
physiological cross-cutting factors that are not bound by strict
categorical designations.

The use of DSM criteria has the clear virtue of creating a common
language for communication between clinicians about the diagnosis of
disorders. The official criteria and disorders that were determined to
have accepted clinical applicability are located in Section II of the
manual. However, it should be noted that these diagnostic criteria and
their

[]{#index_split_009.html#p56}Introduction

**11**

relationships within the classification are based on current research
and may need to be modified as new evidence is gathered by future
research both within and across the domains of proposed disorders.
"Conditions for Further Study," described in Section III, are those for
which we determined that the scientific evidence is not yet available to
support widespread clinical use. These diagnostic criteria are included
to highlight the evolution and direction of scientific advances in these
areas to stimulate further research.

With any ongoing review process, especially one of this complexity,
different viewpoints emerge, and an effort was made to consider various
viewpoints and, when warranted, accommodate them. For example,
personality disorders are included in both Sections II and III. Section
II represents an update of the text associated with the same criteria
found in DSM-IV-TR, whereas Section III includes the proposed research
model for personality disorder diagnosis and conceptualization developed
by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group. As this
field evolves, it is hoped that both versions will serve clinical
practice and research initiatives.

Harmonization With ICD-11

The groups tasked with revising the DSM and ICD systems shared the
overarching goal of harmonizing the two classifications as much as
possible, for the following reasons:

• The existence of two major classifications of mental disorders hinders
the collection and use of national health statistics, the design of
clinical trials aimed at developing new treatments, and the
consideration of global applicability of the results by international
regulatory agencies.

• More broadly, the existence of two classifications complicates
attempts to replicate scientific results across national boundaries.

• Even when the intention was to identify identical patient populations,
DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnoses did not always agree.

Early in the course of the revisions, it became apparent that a shared
organizational structure would help harmonize the classifications. In
fact, the use of a shared framework helped to integrate the work of DSM
and ICD work groups and to focus on scientific issues. The DSM-5
organization and the proposed linear structure of the ICD-11 have been
endorsed by the leadership of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
project as consistent with the initial overall structure of that
project.

Of course, principled disagreements on the classification of
psychopathology and on specific criteria for certain disorders were
expected given the current state of scientific knowledge. However, most
of the salient differences between the DSM and the ICD classifications
do not reflect real scientific differences, but rather represent
historical by-products of independent committee processes.

To the surprise of participants in both revision processes, large
sections of the content fell relatively easily into place, reflecting
real strengths in some areas of the scientific literature, such as
epidemiology, analyses of comorbidity, twin studies, and certain other
genetically informed designs. When disparities emerged, they almost
always reflected the need to make a judgment about where to place a
disorder in the face of incomplete---or, more often, conflicting---data.
Thus, for example, on the basis of patterns of symptoms, comorbidity,
and shared risk factors, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
was placed with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the same data also
supported strong arguments to place ADHD within disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders.

These issues were settled with the preponderance of evidence (most
notably validators approved by the DSM-5 Task Force). The work groups
recognize, however, that future discoveries might change the placement
as well as the contours of individual disorders and, furthermore, that
the simple and linear organization that best supports clinical practice

[]{#index_split_009.html#p57}**12**

[]{#index_split_010.html}

## Introduction {#index_split_010.html#calibre_pb_9 .calibre3}

may not fully capture the complexity and heterogeneity of mental
disorders. The revised organization is coordinated with the mental and
behavioral disorders chapter (Chapter V) of ICD-11, which will utilize
an expanded numeric--alphanumeric coding system. However, the official
coding system in use in the United States at the time of publication of
this manual is that of the *International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification* (ICD-9-CM)---the U.S. adaptation
of ICD-9. *International Classification of Diseases, Tenth* *Revision,
Clinical Modification* (ICD-10-CM), adapted from ICD-10, is scheduled
for implementation in the United States in October 2014. Given the
impending release of ICD-11, it was decided that this iteration, and not
ICD-10, would be the most relevant on which to focus harmonization.
However, given that adoption of the ICD-9-CM coding system will remain
at the time of the DSM-5 release, it will be necessary to use the
ICD-9-CM codes. Furthermore, given that DSM-5's organizational structure
reflects the anticipated structure of ICD-11, the eventual ICD-11 codes
will follow the sequential order of diagnoses in the DSM-5 chapter
structure more closely. At present, both the ICD-9-CM and the ICD-10-CM

codes have been indicated for each disorder. These codes will not be in
sequential order throughout the manual because they were assigned to
complement earlier organizational structures.

Dimensional Approach to Diagnosis

Structural problems rooted in the basic design of the previous DSM
classification, constructed of a large number of narrow diagnostic
categories, have emerged in both clinical practice and research.
Relevant evidence comes from diverse sources, including studies of
comorbidity and the substantial need for not otherwise specified
diagnoses, which represent the majority of diagnoses in areas such as
eating disorders, personality disorders, and autism spectrum disorder.
Studies of both genetic and environmental risk factors, whether based on
twin designs, familial transmission, or molecular analyses, also raise
concerns about the categorical structure of the DSM system. Because the
previous DSM approach considered each diagnosis as categorically
separate from health and from other diagnoses, it did not capture the
widespread sharing of symptoms and risk factors across many disorders
that is apparent in studies of comorbidity. Earlier editions of DSM
focused on excluding false-positive results from diagnoses; thus, its
categories were overly narrow, as is apparent from the widespread need
to use NOS diagnoses. Indeed, the once plausible goal of identifying
homogeneous populations for treatment and research resulted in narrow
diagnostic categories that did not capture clinical reality, symptom
heterogeneity within disorders, and significant sharing of symptoms
across multiple disorders. The historical aspiration of achieving
diagnostic homogeneity by progressive subtyping within disorder
categories no longer is sensible; like most common human ills, mental
disorders are heterogeneous at many levels, ranging from genetic risk
factors to symptoms.

Related to recommendations about alterations in the chapter structure of
DSM-5, members of the diagnostic spectra study group examined whether
scientific validators could inform possible new groupings of related
disorders within the existing categorical framework. Eleven such
indicators were recommended for this purpose: shared neural substrates,
family traits, genetic risk factors, specific environmental risk
factors, biomarkers, temperamental antecedents, abnormalities of
emotional or cognitive processing, symptom similarity, course of
illness, high comorbidity, and shared treatment response. These
indicators served as empirical guidelines to inform decision making by
the work groups and the task force about how to cluster disorders to
maximize their validity and clinical utility.

A series of papers was developed and published in a prominent
international journal ( *Psychological Medicine,* Vol. 39, 2009) as part
of both the DSM-5 and the ICD-11 developmental processes to document
that such validators were most useful for suggesting large groupings of
disorders rather than for "validating" individual disorder diagnostic
criteria.

The regrouping of mental disorders in DSM-5 is intended to enable future
research to en-

hance understanding of disease origins and pathophysiological
commonalities between disorders and provide a base for future
replication wherein data can be reanalyzed over time to continually
assess validity. Ongoing revisions of DSM-5 will make it a "living
document," adaptable to future discoveries in neurobiology, genetics,
and epidemiology.

On the basis of the published findings of this common DSM-5 and ICD-11
analysis, it was demonstrated that clustering of disorders according to
what has been termed *internalizing* and *externalizing* factors
represents an empirically supported framework. Within both the
internalizing group (representing disorders with prominent anxiety,
depressive, and somatic symptoms) and the externalizing group
(representing disorders with prominent impulsive, disruptive conduct,
and substance use symptoms), the sharing of genetic and environmental
risk factors, as shown by twin studies, likely explains much of the
systematic comorbidities seen in both clinical and community samples.
The adjacent placement of "internalizing disorders," characterized by
depressed mood, anxiety, and related physiological and cognitive
symptoms, should aid in developing new diagnostic approaches, including
dimensional approaches, while facilitating the identification of
biological markers.

Similarly, adjacencies of the "externalizing group," including disorders
exhibiting antisocial behaviors, conduct disturbances, addictions, and
impulse-control disorders, should encourage advances in identifying
diagnoses, markers, and underlying mechanisms.

Despite the problem posed by categorical diagnoses, the DSM-5 Task Force
recognized that it is premature scientifically to propose alternative
definitions for most disorders. The organizational structure is meant to
serve as a bridge to new diagnostic approaches without disrupting
current clinical practice or research. With support from DSM-associated
training materials, the National Institutes of Health other funding
agencies, and scientific publications, the more dimensional DSM-5
approach and organizational structure can facilitate research across
current diagnostic categories by encouraging broad investigations within
the proposed chapters and across adjacent chapters. Such a reformulation
of research goals should also keep DSM-5 central to the development of
dimensional approaches to diagnosis that will likely supplement or
supersede current categorical approaches in coming years.

Developmental and Lifespan Considerations

To improve clinical utility, DSM-5 is organized on developmental and
lifespan considerations. It begins with diagnoses thought to reflect
developmental processes that manifest early in life (e.g.,
neurodevelopmental and schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders), followed by diagnoses that more commonly manifest in
adolescence and young adulthood (e.g., bipolar, depressive, and anxiety
disorders), and ends with diagnoses relevant to adulthood and later life
(e.g., neurocognitive disorders). A similar approach has been taken,
where possible, within each chapter. This organizational structure
facilitates the comprehensive use of lifespan information as a way to
assist in diagnostic decision making.

The proposed organization of chapters of DSM-5, after the
neurodevelopmental disorders, is based on groups of internalizing
(emotional and somatic) disorders, externalizing disorders,
neurocognitive disorders, and other disorders. It is hoped that this
organization will encourage further study of underlying
pathophysiological processes that give rise to diagnostic comorbidity
and symptom heterogeneity. Furthermore, by arranging disorder clusters
to mirror clinical reality, DSM-5 should facilitate identification of
potential diagnoses by non--mental health specialists, such as primary
care physicians.

The organizational structure of DSM-5, along with ICD harmonization, is
designed to provide better and more flexible diagnostic concepts for the
next epoch of research and to serve as a useful guide to clinicians in
explaining to patients why they might have received multiple diagnoses
or why they might have received additional or altered diagnoses over
their lifespan.

## Introduction {#index_split_011.html#calibre_pb_10 .calibre3 title="Introduction, Cultural Issues"}

### Cultural Issues {.calibre4}

Mental disorders are defined in relation to cultural, social, and
familial norms and values.

Culture provides interpretive frameworks that shape the experience and
expression of the symptoms, signs, and behaviors that are criteria for
diagnosis. Culture is transmitted, revised, and recreated within the
family and other social systems and institutions. Diagnostic assessment
must therefore consider whether an individual's experiences, symptoms,
and behaviors differ from sociocultural norms and lead to difficulties
in adaptation in the cultures of origin and in specific social or
familial contexts. Key aspects of culture relevant to diagnostic
classification and assessment have been considered in the development of
DSM-5.

In Section III, the "Cultural Formulation" contains a detailed
discussion of culture and diagnosis in DSM-5, including tools for
in-depth cultural assessment. In the Appendix, the

"Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" provides a description of
some common cultural syndromes, idioms of distress, and causal
explanations relevant to clinical practice.

The boundaries between normality and pathology vary across cultures for
specific types of behaviors. Thresholds of tolerance for specific
symptoms or behaviors differ across cultures, social settings, and
families. Hence, the level at which an experience becomes problematic or
pathological will differ. The judgment that a given behavior is abnormal
and requires clinical attention depends on cultural norms that are
internalized by the individual and applied by others around them,
including family members and clinicians. Awareness of the significance
of culture may correct mistaken interpretations of psychopathology, but
culture may also contribute to vulnerability and suffering (e.g., by
amplifying fears that maintain panic disorder or health anxiety).
Cultural meanings, habits, and traditions can also contribute to either
stigma or support in the social and familial response to mental illness.

Culture may provide coping strategies that enhance resilience in
response to illness, or suggest help seeking and options for accessing
health care of various types, including alternative and complementary
health systems. Culture may influence acceptance or rejection of a
diagnosis and adherence to treatments, affecting the course of illness
and recovery. Culture also affects the conduct of the clinical
encounter; as a result, cultural differences between the clinician and
the patient have implications for the accuracy and acceptance of
diagnosis as well as for treatment decisions, prognostic considerations,
and clinical outcomes.

Historically, the construct of the culture-bound syndrome has been a key
interest of cultural psychiatry. In DSM-5, this construct has been
replaced by three concepts that offer greater clinical utility:

1\. *Cultural syndrome* is a cluster or group of co-occurring,
relatively invariant symptoms found in a specific cultural group,
community, or context (e.g., *ataque de nervios*). The syndrome may or
may not be recognized as an illness within the culture (e.g., it might
be labeled in various ways), but such cultural patterns of distress and
features of illness may nevertheless be recognizable by an outside
observer.

2\. *Cultural idiom of distress* is a linguistic term, phrase, or way of
talking about suffering among individuals of a cultural group (e.g.,
similar ethnicity and religion) referring to shared concepts of
pathology and ways of expressing, communicating, or naming essential
features of distress (e.g., *kufungisisa*). An idiom of distress need
not be associated with specific symptoms, syndromes, or perceived
causes. It may be used to convey a wide range of discomfort, including
everyday experiences, subclinical conditions, or suffering due to social
circumstances rather than mental disorders. For example, most cultures
have common bodily idioms of distress used to express a wide range of
suffering and concerns.

3\. *Cultural explanation or perceived cause* is a label, attribution,
or feature of an explanatory model that provides a culturally conceived
etiology or cause for symptoms, illness, or distress (e.g., *maladi
moun*). Causal explanations may be salient features of folk
classifications of disease used by laypersons or healers.

[]{#index_split_011.html#p60}Introduction

**15**

These three concepts (for which discussion and examples are provided in
Section III and the Appendix) suggest cultural ways of understanding and
describing illness experiences that can be elicited in the clinical
encounter. They influence symptomatology, help seeking, clinical
presentations, expectations of treatment, illness adaptation, and
treatment response. The same cultural term often serves more than one of
these functions.

Gender Differences

Sex and gender differences as they relate to the causes and expression
of medical conditions are established for a number of diseases,
including selected mental disorders. Revisions to DSM-5 included review
of potential differences between men and women in the expression of
mental illness. In terms of nomenclature, *sex differences* are
variations attributable to an individual's reproductive organs and XX or
XY chromosomal complement. *Gender differences* are variations that
result from biological sex as well as an individual's
self-representation that includes the psychological, behavioral, and
social consequences of one's perceived gender. The term *gender
differences* is used in DSM-5 because, more commonly, the differences
between men and women are a result of both biological sex and individual
self-representation. However, some of the differences are based on only
biological sex.

Gender can influence illness in a variety of ways. First, it may
exclusively determine whether an individual is at risk for a disorder
(e.g., as in premenstrual dysphoric disorder). Second, gender may
moderate the overall risk for development of a disorder as shown by
marked gender differences in the prevalence and incidence rates for
selected mental disorders. Third, gender may influence the likelihood
that particular symptoms of a disorder are experienced by an individual.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is an example of a disorder
with differences in presentation that are most commonly experienced by
boys or girls. Gender likely has other effects on the experience of a
disorder that are indirectly relevant to psychiatric diagnosis. It may
be that certain symptoms are more readily endorsed by men or women, and
that this contributes to differences in service provision (e.g., women
may be more likely to recognize a depressive, bipolar, or anxiety
disorder and endorse a more comprehensive list of symptoms than men).

Reproductive life cycle events, including estrogen variations, also
contribute to gender differences in risk and expression of illness.
Thus, a specifier for postpartum onset of mania or major depressive
episode denotes a time frame wherein women may be at increased risk for
the onset of an illness episode. In the case of sleep and energy,
alterations are often normative postpartum and thus may have lower
diagnostic reliability in postpartum women.

The manual is configured to include information on gender at multiple
levels. If there are gender-specific symptoms, they have been added to
the diagnostic criteria. A gender-related specifier, such as perinatal
onset of a mood episode, provides additional information on gender and
diagnosis. Finally, other issues that are pertinent to diagnosis and
gender considerations can be found in the section "Gender-Related
Diagnostic Issues."

Use of Other Specified and Unspecified Disorders

To enhance diagnostic specificity, DSM-5 replaces the previous NOS
designation with two options for clinical use: *other specified
disorder* and *unspecified disorder.* The other specified disorder
category is provided to allow the clinician to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific
category within a diagnostic class. This is done by recording the name
of the category, followed by the specific reason. For example, for an
individual with clinically significant depressive symptoms lasting 4
weeks but whose symptomatology falls short of the diagnostic threshold
for a major depressive episode, the clinician would record "other
specified depressive disorder, depressive episode with insufficient
symptoms." If the clinician chooses not to specify the
[]{#index_split_011.html#p61}**16**

[]{#index_split_012.html}

## Introduction {#index_split_012.html#calibre_pb_11 .calibre3}

reason that the criteria are not met for a specific disorder, then
"unspecified depressive disorder" would be diagnosed. Note that the
differentiation between other specified and unspecified disorders is
based on the clinician's decision, providing maximum flexibility for
diagnosis. Clinicians do not have to differentiate between other
specified and unspecified disorders based on some feature of the
presentation itself. When the clinician determines that there is
evidence to specify the nature of the clinical presentation, the other
specified diagnosis can be given. When the clinician is not able to
further specify and describe the clinical presentation, the unspecified
diagnosis can be given. This is left entirely up to clinical judgment.

For a more detailed discussion of how to use other specified and
unspecified designations, see "Use of the Manual" in Section I.

The Multiaxial System

Despite widespread use and its adoption by certain insurance and
governmental agencies, the multiaxial system in DSM-IV was not required
to make a mental disorder diagnosis. A nonaxial assessment system was
also included that simply listed the appropriate Axis I, II, and III
disorders and conditions without axial designations. DSM-5 has moved to
a nonaxial documentation of diagnosis (formerly Axes I, II, and III),
with separate notations for important psychosocial and contextual
factors (formerly Axis IV) and disability (formerly Axis V). This
revision is consistent with the DSM-IV text that states, "The multiaxial
distinction among Axis I, Axis II, and Axis III disorders does not imply
that there are fundamental differences in their conceptualization, that
mental disorders are unrelated to physical or biological factors or
processes, or that general medical conditions are unrelated to
behavioral or psychosocial factors or processes." The approach of
separately noting diagnosis from psychosocial and contextual factors is
also consistent with established WHO

and ICD guidance to consider the individual's functional status
separately from his or her diagnoses or symptom status. In DSM-5, Axis
III has been combined with Axes I and II.

Clinicians should continue to list medical conditions that are important
to the understanding or management of an individual's mental
disorder(s).

DSM-IV Axis IV covered psychosocial and environmental problems that may
affect the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of mental disorders.
Although this axis provided helpful information, even if it was not used
as frequently as intended, the DSM-5 Task Force recommended that DSM-5
should not develop its own classification of psychosocial and
environmental problems, but rather use a selected set of the ICD-9-CM V
codes and the new Z codes contained in ICD-10-CM. The ICD-10 Z codes
were examined to determine which are most relevant to mental disorders
and also to identify gaps.

DSM-IV Axis V consisted of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)
scale, representing the clinician\'s judgment of the individual's
overall level of "functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental
health--illness." It was recommended that the GAF be dropped from DSM-5
for several reasons, including its conceptual lack of clarity (i.e.,
including symptoms, suicide risk, and disabilities in its descriptors)
and questionable psychometrics in routine practice. In order to provide
a global measure of disability, the WHO

Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) is included, for further study,
in Section III of DSM-5 (see the chapter "Assessment Measures"). The
WHODAS is based on the International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF) for use across all of medicine and health
care. The WHODAS (version 2.0), and a modification developed for
children/

adolescents and their parents by the Impairment and Disability Study
Group were included in the DSM-5 field trial.

Online Enhancements

It was challenging to determine what to include in the print version of
DSM-5 to be most clinically relevant and useful and at the same time
maintain a manageable size. For this reason, the inclusion of clinical
rating scales and measures in the print edition is limited to those
considered most relevant. Additional assessment measures used in the
field trials are available online (www.psychiatry.org/dsm5), linked to
the relevant disorders. The Cultural Formulation Interview, Cultural
Formulation Interview---Informant Version, and supplementary modules to
the core Cultural Formulation Interview are also available online at
www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

DSM-5 is available as an online subscription at PsychiatryOnline.org as
well as an ebook. The online component contains modules and assessment
tools to enhance the diagnostic criteria and text. Also available online
is a complete set of supportive references as well as additional helpful
information. The organizational structure of DSM-5, its use of
dimensional measures, and compatibility with ICD codes will allow it to
be readily adaptable to future scientific discoveries and refinements in
its clinical utility. DSM-5 will be analyzed over time to continually
assess its validity and enhance its value to clinicians.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p63} *This page intentionally left blank*

[]{#index_split_012.html#p64}**Use of the Manual**

The introduction contains much of the history and developmental process
of the DSM-5 revision. This section is designed to provide a practical
guide to using DSM-5, particularly in clinical practice. The primary
purpose of DSM-5 is to assist trained clinicians in the diagnosis of
their patients' mental disorders as part of a case formulation
assessment that leads to a fully informed treatment plan for each
individual. The symptoms contained in the respective diagnostic criteria
sets do not constitute comprehensive definitions of underlying
disorders, which encompass cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and
physiological processes that are far more complex than can be described
in these brief summaries. Rather, they are intended to summarize
characteristic syndromes of signs and symptoms that point to an
underlying disorder with a characteristic developmental history,
biological and environmental risk factors, neuropsychological and
physiological correlates, and typical clinical course.

Approach to Clinical Case Formulation

The case formulation for any given patient must involve a careful
clinical history and concise summary of the social, psychological, and
biological factors that may have contributed to developing a given
mental disorder. Hence, it is not sufficient to simply check off the
symptoms in the diagnostic criteria to make a mental disorder diagnosis.
Although a systematic check for the presence of these criteria as they
apply to each patient will assure a more reliable assessment, the
relative severity and valence of individual criteria and their
contribution to a diagnosis require clinical judgment. The symptoms in
our diagnostic criteria are part of the relatively limited repertoire of
human emotional responses to internal and external stresses that are
generally maintained in a homeostatic balance without a disruption in
normal functioning. It requires clinical training to recognize when the
combination of predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective
factors has resulted in a psychopathological condition in which physical
signs and symptoms exceed normal ranges. The ultimate goal of a clinical
case formulation is to use the available contextual and diagnostic
information in developing a comprehensive treatment plan that is
informed by the individual's cultural and social context. However,
recommendations for the selection and use of the most appropriate
evidence-based treatment options for each disorder are beyond the scope
of this manual.

Although decades of scientific effort have gone into developing the
diagnostic criteria sets for the disorders included in Section II, it is
well recognized that this set of categorical diagnoses does not fully
describe the full range of mental disorders that individuals experience
and present to clinicians on a daily basis throughout the world. As
noted previously in the introduction, the range of genetic/environmental
interactions over the course of human development affecting cognitive,
emotional and behavioral function is virtually limitless. As a result,
it is impossible to capture the full range of psychopathology in the
categorical diagnostic categories that we are now using. Hence, it is
also necessary to include "other specified/unspecified" disorder options
for presentations that do not fit exactly into the diagnostic boundaries
of disorders in each chapter. In an emergency department setting, it may
be possible to identify only the most prominent symptom expressions
associated with a particular chapter---for example, delusions,
hallucinations, **19**

[]{#index_split_012.html#p65}**20**

Use of the Manual

mania, depression, anxiety, substance intoxication, or neurocognitive
symptoms---so that an "unspecified" disorder in that category is
identified until a fuller differential diagnosis is possible.

Definition of a Mental Disorder

Each disorder identified in Section II of the manual (excluding those in
the chapters entitled "Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other
Adverse Effects of Medication" and "Other Conditions That May Be a Focus
of Clinical Attention") must meet the definition of a mental disorder.
Although no definition can capture all aspects of all disorders in the
range contained in DSM-5, the following elements are required: A mental
disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant
disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or
behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological,
or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental
disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability
in social, occupational, or other important activities.

An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or
loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder.
Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and
conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not
mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a
dysfunction in the individual, as described above.

The diagnosis of a mental disorder should have clinical utility: it
should help clinicians to determine prognosis, treatment plans, and
potential treatment outcomes for their patients. However, the diagnosis
of a mental disorder is not equivalent to a need for treatment. Need for
treatment is a complex clinical decision that takes into consideration
symptom severity, symptom salience (e.g., the presence of suicidal
ideation), the patient's distress (mental pain) associated with the
symptom(s), disability related to the patient's symptoms, risks and
benefits of available treatments, and other factors (e.g., psychiatric
symptoms complicating other illness). Clinicians may thus encounter
individuals whose symptoms do not meet full criteria for a mental
disorder but who demonstrate a clear need for treatment or care. The
fact that some individuals do not show all symptoms indicative of a
diagnosis should not be used to justify limiting their access to
appropriate care.

Approaches to validating diagnostic criteria for discrete categorical
mental disorders have included the following types of evidence:
antecedent validators (similar genetic markers, family traits,
temperament, and environmental exposure), concurrent validators (similar
neural substrates, biomarkers, emotional and cognitive processing, and
symptom similarity), and predictive validators (similar clinical course
and treatment response). In DSM-5, we recognize that the current
diagnostic criteria for any single disorder will not necessarily
identify a homogeneous group of patients who can be characterized
reliably with all of these validators. Available evidence shows that
these validators cross existing diagnostic boundaries but tend to
congregate more frequently within and across adjacent DSM-5 chapter
groups. Until incontrovertible etiological or pathophysiological
mechanisms are identified to fully validate specific disorders or
disorder spectra, the most important standard for the DSM-5 disorder
criteria will be their clinical utility for the assessment of clinical
course and treatment response of individuals grouped by a given set of
diagnostic criteria.

This definition of mental disorder was developed for clinical, public
health, and research purposes. Additional information is usually
required beyond that contained in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria in order
to make legal judgments on such issues as criminal responsibility,
eligibility for disability compensation, and competency (see "Cautionary
Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5" elsewhere in this manual).

[]{#index_split_012.html#p66}Use of the Manual

**21**

Criterion for Clinical Significance

There have been substantial efforts by the DSM-5 Task Force and the
World Health Organization (WHO) to separate the concepts of mental
disorder and disability (impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning). In the WHO system, the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) covers all diseases and disorders,
while the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
Health (ICF) provides a separate classification of global disability.
The WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) is based on the ICF and
has proven useful as a standardized measure of disability for mental
disorders. However, in the absence of clear biological markers or
clinically useful measurements of severity for many mental disorders, it
has not been possible to completely separate normal and pathological
symptom expressions contained in diagnostic criteria.

This gap in information is particularly problematic in clinical
situations in which the patient's symptom presentation by itself
(particularly in mild forms) is not inherently pathological and may be
encountered in individuals for whom a diagnosis of "mental disorder"
would be inappropriate. Therefore, a generic diagnostic criterion
requiring distress or disability has been used to establish disorder
thresholds, usually worded "the disturbance causes clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning." The text following the revised
definition of a mental disorder acknowledges that this criterion may be
especially helpful in determining a patient's need for treatment. Use of
information from family members and other third parties (in addition to
the individual) regarding the individual's performance is recommended
when necessary.

Elements of a Diagnosis

Diagnostic Criteria and Descriptors

Diagnostic criteria are offered as guidelines for making diagnoses, and
their use should be informed by clinical judgment. Text descriptions,
including introductory sections of each diagnostic chapter, can help
support diagnosis (e.g., providing differential diagnoses; describing
the criteria more fully under "Diagnostic Features").

Following the assessment of diagnostic criteria, clinicians should
consider the application of disorder subtypes and/or specifiers as
appropriate. Severity and course specifiers should be applied to denote
the individual's current presentation, but only when the full criteria
are met. When full criteria are not met, clinicians should consider
whether the symptom presentation meets criteria for an "other specified"
or "unspecified" designation. Where applicable, specific criteria for
defining disorder severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe, extreme),
descriptive features (e.g., with good to fair insight; in a controlled
environment), and course (e.g., in partial remission, in full remission,
recurrent) are provided with each diagnosis. On the basis of the
clinical interview, text descriptions, criteria, and clinician judgment,
a final diagnosis is made.

The general convention in DSM-5 is to allow multiple diagnoses to be
assigned for those presentations that meet criteria for more than one
DSM-5 disorder.

Subtypes and Specifiers

Subtypes and specifiers (some of which are coded in the fourth, fifth,
or sixth digit) are provided for increased specificity. *Subtypes*
define mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive phenomenological
subgroupings within a diagnosis and are indicated by the instruction
"*Specify* whether" in the criteria set. In contrast, *specifiers* are
not intended to be mutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive, and as a
consequence, more than one specifier may be given. Specifiers are
indicated by the instruction "*Specify*" or "*Specify* if" in the
criteria set. Specifiers provide an opportunity to define a more
homogeneous subgrouping of []{#index_split_012.html#p67}**22**

Use of the Manual

individuals with the disorder who share certain features (e.g., major
depressive disorder, with mixed features) and to convey information that
is relevant to the management of the individual's disorder, such as the
"with other medical comorbidity" specifier in sleep-wake disorders.
Although a fifth digit is sometimes assigned to code a subtype or
specifier (e.g., 294.11 \[F02.81\] major neurocognitive disorder due to
Alzheimer's disease, with behavioral disturbance) or severity (296.21
\[F32.0\] major depressive disorder, single episode, mild), the majority
of subtypes and specifiers included in DSM-5 cannot be coded within the
ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM systems and are indicated only by including the
subtype or specifier after the name of the disorder (e.g., social
anxiety disorder \[social phobia\], performance type). Note that in some
cases, a specifier or subtype is codable in ICD-10-CM

but not in ICD-9-CM. Accordingly, in some cases the 4th or 5th character
codes for the subtypes or specifiers are provided only for the ICD-10-CM
coding designations.

A DSM-5 diagnosis is usually applied to the individual's current
presentation; previous diagnoses from which the individual has recovered
should be clearly noted as such.

Specifiers indicating *course* (e.g., in partial remission, in full
remission) may be listed after the diagnosis and are indicated in a
number of criteria sets. Where available, *severity specifiers* are
provided to guide clinicians in rating the intensity, frequency,
duration, symptom count, or other severity indicator of a disorder.
Severity specifiers are indicated by the instruction "*Specify* current
severity" in the criteria set and include disorder-specific definitions.
*Descriptive features specifiers* have also been provided in the
criteria set and convey additional information that can inform treatment
planning (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder, with poor insight). Not
all disorders include course, severity, and/or descriptive features
specifiers.

Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other

Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention

In addition to important psychosocial and environmental factors (see
"The Multiaxial System" in the "Introduction" elsewhere in this manual),
these chapters in Section II also contain other conditions that are not
mental disorders but may be encountered by mental health clinicians.
These conditions may be listed as a reason for clinical visit in
addition to, or in place of, the mental disorders listed in Section II.
A separate chapter is devoted to medication-induced disorders and other
adverse effects of medication that may be assessed and treated by
clinicians in mental health practice such as akathisia, tardive
dyskinesia, and dystonia. The description of neuroleptic malignant
syndrome is expanded from that provided in DSM-IV-TR to highlight the
emergent and potentially life-threatening nature of this condition, and
a new entry on antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is provided. An
additional chapter discusses other conditions that may be a focus of
clinical attention. These include relational problems, problems related
to abuse and neglect, problems with adherence to treatment regimens,
obesity, antisocial behavior, and malingering.

Principal Diagnosis

When more than one diagnosis for an individual is given in an inpatient
setting, the principal diagnosis is the condition established after
study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the
individual. When more than one diagnosis is given for an individual in
an outpatient setting, the reason for visit is the condition that is
chiefly responsible for the ambulatory care medical services received
during the visit. In most cases, the principal diagnosis or the reason
for visit is also the main focus of attention or treatment. It is often
difficult (and somewhat arbitrary) to determine which diagnosis is the
principal diagnosis or the reason for visit, especially when, for
example, a substance-related diagnosis such as alcohol use disorder is
accompanied by a nonsubstance-related diagnosis such as schizophrenia.
For example, it may be unclear which diagnosis should
[]{#index_split_012.html#p68}Use of the Manual

**23**

be considered "principal" for an individual hospitalized with both
schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder, because each condition may have
contributed equally to the need for admission and treatment. The
principal diagnosis is indicated by listing it first, and the remaining
disorders are listed in order of focus of attention and treatment. When
the principal diagnosis or reason for visit is a mental disorder due to
another medical condition (e.g., major neurocognitive disorder due to
Alzheimer's disease, psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm),
ICD coding rules require that the etiological medical condition be
listed first. In that case, the principal diagnosis or reason for visit
would be the mental disorder due to the medical condition, the second
listed diagnosis. In most cases, the disorder listed as the principal
diagnosis or the reason for visit is followed by the qualifying phrase
"(principal diagnosis)" or "(reason for visit)."

Provisional Diagnosis

The specifier "provisional" can be used when there is a strong
presumption that the full criteria will ultimately be met for a disorder
but not enough information is available to make a firm diagnosis. The
clinician can indicate the diagnostic uncertainty by recording

"(provisional)" following the diagnosis. For example, this diagnosis
might be used when an individual who appears to have a major depressive
disorder is unable to give an adequate history, and thus it cannot be
established that the full criteria are met. Another use of the term
*provisional* is for those situations in which differential diagnosis
depends exclusively on the duration of illness. For example, a diagnosis
of schizophreniform disorder requires a duration of less than 6 months
but of at least 1 month and can only be given provisionally if assigned
before remission has occurred.

Coding and Reporting Procedures

Each disorder is accompanied by an identifying diagnostic and
statistical code, which is typically used by institutions and agencies
for data collection and billing purposes. There are specific recording
protocols for these diagnostic codes (identified as coding notes in the
text) that were established by WHO, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics to ensure consistent
international recording of prevalence and mortality rates for identified
health conditions. For most clinicians, the codes are used to identify
the diagnosis or reason for visit for CMS and private insurance service
claims. The official coding system in use in the United States as of
publication of this manual is ICD-9-CM. Official adoption of ICD-10-CM
is scheduled to take place on October 1, 2014, and these codes, which
are shown parenthetically in this manual, should not be used until the
official implementation occurs. Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes have
been listed 1) preceding the name of the disorder in the classification
and 2) accompanying the criteria set for each disorder. For some
diagnoses (e.g., neurocognitive and substance/medication-induced
disorders), the appropriate code depends on further specification and is
listed within the criteria set for the disorder, as coding notes, and,
in some cases, further clarified in a section on recording procedures.
The names of some disorders are followed by alternative terms enclosed
in parentheses, which, in most cases, were the DSM-IV names for the
disorders.

Assessment and Monitoring Tools

The various components of DSM-5 are provided to facilitate patient
assessment and to aid in developing a comprehensive case formulation.
Whereas the diagnostic criteria in Section II are well-established
measures that have undergone extensive review, the assess-

ment tools, a cultural formulation interview, and conditions for further
study included in Section III are those for which we determined that the
scientific evidence is not yet available to support widespread clinical
use. These diagnostic aids and criteria are included to highlight the
evolution and direction of scientific advances in these areas and to
stimulate further research.

Each of the measures in Section III is provided to aid in a
comprehensive assessment of individuals that will contribute to a
diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to the individual presentation and
clinical context. Where cultural dynamics are particularly important for
diagnostic assessment, the cultural formulation interview should be
considered as a useful aid to communication with the individual.
Cross-cutting symptom and diagnosis-specific severity measures provide
quantitative ratings of important clinical areas that are designed to be
used at the initial evaluation to establish a baseline for comparison
with ratings on subsequent encounters to monitor changes and inform
treatment planning.

The use of such measures will undoubtedly be facilitated by digital
applications, and the measures are included in Section III to provide
for further evaluation and development. As with each DSM edition, the
diagnostic criteria and the DSM-5 classification of mental disorders
reflect the current consensus on the evolving knowledge in our field.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p70}**Cautionary Statement for**

**Forensic Use of DSM-5**

Although the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and text are primarily designed
to assist clinicians in conducting clinical assessment, case
formulation, and treatment planning, DSM-5 is also used as a reference
for the courts and attorneys in assessing the forensic consequences of
mental disorders. As a result, it is important to note that the
definition of mental disorder included in DSM-5 was developed to meet
the needs of clinicians, public health professionals, and research
investigators rather than all of the technical needs of the courts and
legal professionals. It is also important to note that DSM-5 does not
provide treatment guidelines for any given disorder.

When used appropriately, diagnoses and diagnostic information can assist
legal decision makers in their determinations. For example, when the
presence of a mental disorder is the predicate for a subsequent legal
determination (e.g., involuntary civil commitment), the use of an
established system of diagnosis enhances the value and reliability of
the determination. By providing a compendium based on a review of the
pertinent clinical and research literature, DSM-5 may facilitate legal
decision makers' understanding of the relevant characteristics of mental
disorders. The literature related to diagnoses also serves as a check on
ungrounded speculation about mental disorders and about the functioning
of a particular individual. Finally, diagnostic information about
longitudinal course may improve decision making when the legal issue
concerns an individual's mental functioning at a past or future point in
time.

However, the use of DSM-5 should be informed by an awareness of the
risks and limitations of its use in forensic settings. When DSM-5
categories, criteria, and textual descriptions are employed for forensic
purposes, there is a risk that diagnostic information will be misused or
misunderstood. These dangers arise because of the imperfect fit between
the questions of ultimate concern to the law and the information
contained in a clinical diagnosis. In most situations, the clinical
diagnosis of a DSM-5 mental disorder such as intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder), schizophrenia, major
neurocognitive disorder, gambling disorder, or pedophilic disorder does
not imply that an individual with such a condition meets legal criteria
for the presence of a mental disorder or a specified legal standard
(e.g., for competence, criminal responsibility, or disability). For the
latter, additional information is usually required beyond that contained
in the DSM-5 diagnosis, which might include information about the
individual's functional impairments and how these impairments affect the
particular abilities in question. It is precisely because impairments,
abilities, and disabilities vary widely within each diagnostic category
that assignment of a particular diagnosis does not imply a specific
level of impairment or disability.

Use of DSM-5 to assess for the presence of a mental disorder by
nonclinical, nonmedical, or otherwise insufficiently trained individuals
is not advised. Nonclinical decision makers should also be cautioned
that a diagnosis does not carry any necessary implications regarding the
etiology or causes of the individual's mental disorder or the
individual's degree of control over behaviors that may be associated
with the disorder. Even when diminished control over one's behavior is a
feature of the disorder, having the diagnosis in itself does not
demonstrate that a particular individual is (or was) unable to control
his or her behavior at a particular time.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p76}**Neurodevelopmental**

**Disorders**

The neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of conditions with onset in
the developmental period. The disorders typically manifest early in
development, often before the child enters grade school, and are
characterized by developmental deficits that produce impairments of
personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning. The range of
developmental deficits varies from very specific limitations of learning
or control of executive functions to global impairments of social skills
or intelligence. The neurodevelopmental disorders frequently co-occur;
for example, individuals with autism spectrum disorder often have
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and many
children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also have
a specific learning disorder. For some disorders, the clinical
presentation includes symptoms of excess as well as deficits and delays
in achieving expected milestones. For example, autism spectrum disorder
is diagnosed only when the characteristic deficits of social
communication are accompanied by excessively repetitive behaviors,
restricted interests, and insistence on sameness.

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is
characterized by deficits in general mental abilities, such as
reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment,
academic learning, and learning from experience. The deficits result in
impairments of adaptive functioning, such that the individual fails to
meet standards of personal independence and social responsibility in one
or more aspects of daily life, including communication, social
participation, academic or occupational functioning, and personal
independence at home or in community settings. Global developmental
delay, as its name implies, is diagnosed when an individual fails to
meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual
functioning. The diagnosis is used for individuals who are unable to
undergo systematic assessments of intellectual functioning, including
children who are too young to participate in standardized testing.
Intellectual disability may result from an acquired insult during the
developmental period from, for example, a severe head injury, in which
case a neurocognitive disorder also may be diagnosed.

The communication disorders include language disorder, speech sound
disorder, social (pragmatic) communication disorder, and childhood-onset
fluency disorder (stuttering). The first three disorders are
characterized by deficits in the development and use of language,
speech, and social communication, respectively. Childhood-onset fluency
disorder is characterized by disturbances of the normal fluency and
motor production of speech, including repetitive sounds or syllables,
prolongation of consonants or vowel sounds, broken words, blocking, or
words produced with an excess of physical tension.

Like other neurodevelopmental disorders, communication disorders begin
early in life and may produce lifelong functional impairments.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in
social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts,
including deficits in social reciprocity, nonverbal communicative
behaviors used for social interaction, and skills in developing,
maintaining, and understanding relationships. In addition to the social
communication deficits, the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder
requires the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior,
interests, or activities. Because symptoms change with development and
may be masked by compensatory mechanisms, the diagnostic criteria may
**31**

[]{#index_split_012.html#p77}**32**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

be met based on historical information, although the current
presentation must cause significant impairment.

Within the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, individual clinical
characteristics are noted through the use of specifiers (with or without
accompanying intellectual impairment; with or without accompanying
structural language impairment; associated with a known medical/genetic
or environmental/acquired condition; associated with another
neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder), as well as
specifiers that describe the autistic symptoms (age at first concern;
with or without loss of established skills; severity). These specifiers
provide clinicians with an opportunity to individualize the diagnosis
and communicate a richer clinical description of the affected
individuals. For example, many individuals previously diagnosed with
Asperger's disorder would now receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum
disorder without language or intellectual impairment.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by impairing levels of
inattention, disorganization, and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity.
Inattention and disorganization entail inability to stay on task,
seeming not to listen, and losing materials, at levels that are
inconsistent with age or developmental level. Hyperactivity-impulsivity
entails overactivity, fidgeting, inability to stay seated, intruding
into other people's activities, and inability to wait---symptoms that
are excessive for age or developmental level. In childhood, ADHD
frequently overlaps with disorders that are often considered to be
"externalizing disorders," such as oppositional defiant disorder and
conduct disorder. ADHD often persists into adulthood, with resultant
impairments of social, academic and occupational functioning.

The neurodevelopmental motor disorders include developmental
coordination disorder, stereotypic movement disorder, and tic disorders.
Developmental coordination disorder is characterized by deficits in the
acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills and is manifested
by clumsiness and slowness or inaccuracy of performance of motor skills
that cause interference with activities of daily living. Stereotypic
movement disorder is diagnosed when an individual has repetitive,
seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor behaviors, such as
hand flapping, body rocking, head banging, self-biting, or hitting. The
movements interfere with social, academic, or other activities. If the
behaviors cause self-injury, this should be specified as part of the
diagnostic description.

Tic disorders are characterized by the presence of motor or vocal tics,
which are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic, sterotyped motor
movements or vocalizations. The duration, presumed etiology, and
clinical presentation define the specific tic disorder that is
diagnosed: Tourette's disorder, persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic
disorder, provisional tic disorder, other specified tic disorder, and
unspecified tic disorder. Tourette's disorder is diagnosed when the
individual has multiple motor and vocal tics that have been present for
at least 1 year and that have a waxing-waning symptom course.

Specific learning disorder, as the name implies, is diagnosed when there
are specific deficits in an individual's ability to perceive or process
information efficiently and accurately. This neurodevelopmental disorder
first manifests during the years of formal schooling and is
characterized by persistent and impairing difficulties with learning
foundational academic skills in reading, writing, and/or math. The
individual's performance of the affected academic skills is well below
average for age, or acceptable performance levels are achieved only with
extraordinary effort. Specific learning disorder may occur in
individuals identified as intellectually gifted and manifest only when
the learning demands or assessment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose
barriers that cannot be overcome by their innate intelligence and
compensatory strategies. For all individuals, specific learning disorder
can produce lifelong impairments in activities dependent on the skills,
including occupational performance.

The use of specifiers for the neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses
enriches the clinical description of the individual's clinical course
and current symptomatology. In addition to specifiers that describe the
clinical presentation, such as age at onset or severity ratings, the
neurodevelopmental disorders may include the specifier "associated with
a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor." This
specifier gives clini-

[]{#index_split_012.html#p78}Intellectual Disability (Intellectual
Developmental Disorder) **33**

cians an opportunity to document factors that may have played a role in
the etiology of the disorder, as well as those that might affect the
clinical course. Examples include genetic disorders, such as fragile X
syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Rett syndrome; medical conditions such
as epilepsy; and environmental factors, including very low birth weight
and fetal alcohol exposure (even in the absence of stigmata of fetal
alcohol syndrome).

**Intellectual Disabilities**

Intellectual Disability

(Intellectual Developmental Disorder)

Diagnostic Criteria

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is a
disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both
intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social,
and practical domains. The following three criteria must be met: A.
Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving,
planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning
from experience, confirmed by both clinical assessment and
individualized, standardized intelligence testing.

B. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet
developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and
social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits
limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as
communication, social participation, and independent living, across
multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.

C. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental
period.

**Note:** The diagnostic term *intellectual disability* is the
equivalent term for the ICD-11 diagnosis of *intellectual developmental
disorders.* Although the term *intellectual disability* is used
throughout this manual, both terms are used in the title to clarify
relationships with other classification systems. Moreover, a federal
statute in the United States (Public Law 111-256, Rosa's Law) replaces
the term *mental retardation* with *intellectual disability,* and
research journals use the term *intellectual disability.* Thus,
*intellectual disability* is the term in common use by medical,
educational, and other professions and by the lay public and advocacy
groups.

*Specify* current severity (see Table 1):

**317 (F70) Mild**

**318.0 (F71) Moderate**

**318.1 (F72) Severe**

**318.2 (F73) Profound**

Specifiers

The various levels of severity are defined on the basis of adaptive
functioning, and not IQ

scores, because it is adaptive functioning that determines the level of
supports required.

Moreover, IQ measures are less valid in the lower end of the IQ range.

Developmental Disorder) **37**

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder) are deficits in general mental abilities
(Criterion A) and impairment in everyday adaptive functioning, in
comparison to an individual's age-, gender-, and socioculturally matched
peers (Criterion B). Onset is during the developmental period (Criterion
C). The diagnosis of intellectual disability is based on both clinical
assessment and standardized testing of intellectual and adaptive
functions.

Criterion A refers to intellectual functions that involve reasoning,
problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, learning from
instruction and experience, and practical understanding. Critical
components include verbal comprehension, working memory, perceptual
reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract thought, and cognitive
efficacy. Intellectual functioning is typically measured with
individually administered and psychometrically valid, comprehensive,
culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound tests of intelligence.
Individuals with intellectual disability have scores of approximately
two standard deviations or more below the population mean, including a
margin for measurement error (generally +5 points). On tests with a
standard deviation of 15 and a mean of 100, this involves a score of
65--75 (70 ± 5). Clinical training and judgment are required to
interpret test results and assess intellectual performance.

Factors that may affect test scores include practice effects and the
"Flynn effect' (i.e., overly high scores due to out-of-date test norms).
Invalid scores may result from the use of brief intelligence screening
tests or group tests; highly discrepant individual subtest scores may
make an overall IQ score invalid. Instruments must be normed for the
individual's sociocultural background and native language. Co-occurring
disorders that affect communication, language, and/or motor or sensory
function may affect test scores. Individual cognitive profiles based on
neuropsychological testing are more useful for understanding
intellectual abilities than a single IQ score. Such testing may identify
areas of relative strengths and weaknesses, an assessment important for
academic and vocational planning.

IQ test scores are approximations of conceptual functioning but may be
insufficient to assess reasoning in real-life situations and mastery of
practical tasks. For example, a person with an IQ score above 70 may
have such severe adaptive behavior problems in social judgment, social
understanding, and other areas of adaptive functioning that the person's
actual functioning is comparable to that of individuals with a lower IQ
score. Thus, clinical judgment is needed in interpreting the results of
IQ tests.

Deficits in adaptive functioning (Criterion B) refer to how well a
person meets community standards of personal independence and social
responsibility, in comparison to others of similar age and sociocultural
background. Adaptive functioning involves adaptive reasoning in three
domains: conceptual, social, and practical. The *conceptual (academic)
domain* involves competence in memory, language, reading, writing, math
reasoning, acquisition of practical knowledge, problem solving, and
judgment in novel situations, among others. The *social domain* involves
awareness of others' thoughts, feelings, and experiences; empathy;
interpersonal communication skills; friendship abilities; and social
judgment, among others. The *practical domain* involves learning and
self-management across life settings, including personal care, job
responsibilities, money management, recreation, self-management of
behavior, and school and work task organization, among others.
Intellectual capacity, education, motivation, socialization, personality
features, vocational opportunity, cultural experience, and coexisting
general medical conditions or mental disorders influence adaptive
functioning.

Adaptive functioning is assessed using both clinical evaluation and
individualized, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound measures.
Standardized measures are used with knowledgeable informants (e.g.,
parent or other family member; teacher; counselor; care provider) and
the individual to the extent possible. Additional sources of information
include educational, developmental, medical, and mental health
evaluations.

Scores from standardized measures and interview sources must be
interpreted using clinical judgment. When standardized testing is
difficult or impossible, because of a variety of

[]{#index_split_012.html#p83}**38**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

factors (e.g., sensory impairment, severe problem behavior), the
individual may be diagnosed with unspecified intellectual disability.
Adaptive functioning may be difficult to assess in a controlled setting
(e.g., prisons, detention centers); if possible, corroborative
information reflecting functioning outside those settings should be
obtained.

Criterion B is met when at least one domain of adaptive
functioning---conceptual, social, or practical---is sufficiently
impaired that ongoing support is needed in order for the person to
perform adequately in one or more life settings at school, at work, at
home, or in the community. To meet diagnostic criteria for intellectual
disability, the deficits in adaptive functioning must be directly
related to the intellectual impairments described in Criterion A.
Criterion C, onset during the developmental period, refers to
recognition that intellectual and adaptive deficits are present during
childhood or adolescence.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Intellectual disability is a heterogeneous condition with multiple
causes. There may be associated difficulties with social judgment;
assessment of risk; self-management of behavior, emotions, or
interpersonal relationships; or motivation in school or work
environments.

Lack of communication skills may predispose to disruptive and aggressive
behaviors. Gullibility is often a feature, involving naiveté in social
situations and a tendency for being easily led by others. Gullibility
and lack of awareness of risk may result in exploitation by others and
possible victimization, fraud, unintentional criminal involvement, false
confessions, and risk for physical and sexual abuse. These associated
features can be important in criminal cases, including Atkins-type
hearings involving the death penalty.

Individuals with a diagnosis of intellectual disability with
co-occurring mental disorders are at risk for suicide. They think about
suicide, make suicide attempts, and may die from them. Thus, screening
for suicidal thoughts is essential in the assessment process. Because of
a lack of awareness of risk and danger, accidental injury rates may be
increased.

Prevalence

Intellectual disability has an overall general population prevalence of
approximately 1%, and prevalence rates vary by age. Prevalence for
severe intellectual disability is approximately 6 per 1,000.

Development and Course

Onset of intellectual disability is in the developmental period. The age
and characteristic features at onset depend on the etiology and severity
of brain dysfunction. Delayed motor, language, and social milestones may
be identifiable within the first 2 years of life among those with more
severe intellectual disability, while mild levels may not be
identifiable until school age when difficulty with academic learning
becomes apparent. All criteria (including Criterion C) must be fulfilled
by history or current presentation. Some children under age 5 years
whose presentation will eventually meet criteria for intellectual
disability have deficits that meet criteria for global developmental
delay.

When intellectual disability is associated with a genetic syndrome,
there may be a characteristic physical appearance (as in, e.g., Down
syndrome). Some syndromes have a *behavioral phenotype,* which refers to
specific behaviors that are characteristic of particular genetic
disorder (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). In acquired forms, the onset may
be abrupt following an illness such as meningitis or encephalitis or
head trauma occurring during the developmental period. When intellectual
disability results from a loss of previously acquired cognitive skills,
as in severe traumatic brain injury, the diagnoses of intellectual
disability and of a neurocognitive disorder may both be assigned.

Although intellectual disability is generally nonprogressive, in certain
genetic disorders (e.g., Rett syndrome) there are periods of worsening,
followed by stabilization, and in

[]{#index_split_012.html#p84}Intellectual Disability (Intellectual
Developmental Disorder) **39**

others (e.g., San Phillippo syndrome) progressive worsening of
intellectual function. After early childhood, the disorder is generally
lifelong, although severity levels may change over time. The course may
be influenced by underlying medical or genetic conditions and
co-occurring conditions (e.g., hearing or visual impairments, epilepsy).
Early and ongoing interventions may improve adaptive functioning
throughout childhood and adulthood. In some cases, these result in
significant improvement of intellectual functioning, such that the
diagnosis of intellectual disability is no longer appropriate. Thus, it
is common practice when assessing infants and young children to delay
diagnosis of intellectual disability until after an appropriate course
of intervention is provided. For older children and adults, the extent
of support provided may allow for full participation in all activities
of daily living and improved adaptive function. Diagnostic assessments
must determine whether improved adaptive skills are the result of a
stable, generalized new skill acquisition (in which case the diagnosis
of intellectual disability may no longer be appropriate) or whether the
improvement is contingent on the presence of supports and ongoing
interventions (in which case the diagnosis of intellectual disability
may still be appropriate).

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Prenatal etiologies include genetic syndromes (e.g., sequence variations
or copy number variants involving one or more genes; chromosomal
disorders), inborn errors of metabolism, brain malformations, maternal
disease (including placental disease), and environmental influences
(e.g., alcohol, other drugs, toxins, teratogens). Perinatal causes
include a variety of labor and delivery-related events leading to
neonatal encephalopathy. Postnatal causes include hypoxic ischemic
injury, traumatic brain injury, infections, demyelinating disorders,
seizure disorders (e.g., infantile spasms), severe and chronic social
deprivation, and toxic metabolic syndromes and intoxications (e.g.,
lead, mercury).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Intellectual disability occurs in all races and cultures. Cultural
sensitivity and knowledge are needed during assessment, and the
individual's ethnic, cultural, and linguistic background, available
experiences, and adaptive functioning within his or her community and
cultural setting must be taken into account.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Overall, males are more likely than females to be diagnosed with both
mild (average male:female ratio 1.6:1) and severe (average male:female
ratio 1.2:1) forms of intellectual disability. However, gender ratios
vary widely in reported studies. Sex-linked genetic factors and male
vulnerability to brain insult may account for some of the gender
differences.

Diagnostic Markers

A comprehensive evaluation includes an assessment of intellectual
capacity and adaptive functioning; identification of genetic and
nongenetic etiologies; evaluation for associated medical conditions
(e.g., cerebral palsy, seizure disorder); and evaluation for
co-occurring mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Components of
the evaluation may include basic pre-and perinatal medical history,
three-generational family pedigree, physical examination, genetic
evaluation (e.g., karyotype or chromosomal microarray analysis and
testing for specific genetic syndromes), and metabolic screening and
neuroimaging assessment.

Differential Diagnosis

The diagnosis of intellectual disability should be made whenever
Criteria A, B, and C are met. A diagnosis of intellectual disability
should not be assumed because of a particular

[]{#index_split_012.html#p85}**40**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

genetic or medical condition. A genetic syndrome linked to intellectual
disability should be noted as a concurrent diagnosis with the
intellectual disability.

Major and mild neurocognitive disorders.

Intellectual disability is categorized as a neurodevelopmental disorder
and is distinct from the neurocognitive disorders, which are
characterized by a loss of cognitive functioning. Major neurocognitive
disorder may co-occur with intellectual disability (e.g., an individual
with Down syndrome who develops Alzheimer's disease, or an individual
with intellectual disability who loses further cognitive capacity
following a head injury). In such cases, the diagnoses of intellectual
disability and neurocognitive disorder may both be given.

Communication disorders and specific learning disorder.

These neurodevelopmental

disorders are specific to the communication and learning domains and do
not show deficits in intellectual and adaptive behavior. They may
co-occur with intellectual disability.

Both diagnoses are made if full criteria are met for intellectual
disability and a communication disorder or specific learning disorder.

Autism spectrum disorder.

Intellectual disability is common among individuals with autism spectrum
disorder. Assessment of intellectual ability may be complicated by
social-communication and behavior deficits inherent to autism spectrum
disorder, which may interfere with understanding and complying with test
procedures. Appropriate assessment of intellectual functioning in autism
spectrum disorder is essential, with reassessment across the
developmental period, because IQ scores in autism spectrum disorder may
be unstable, particularly in early childhood.

Comorbidity

Co-occurring mental, neurodevelopmental, medical, and physical
conditions are frequent in intellectual disability, with rates of some
conditions (e.g., mental disorders, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy) three
to four times higher than in the general population. The prognosis and
outcome of co-occurring diagnoses may be influenced by the presence of
intellectual disability. Assessment procedures may require modifications
because of associated disorders, including communication disorders,
autism spectrum disorder, and motor, sensory, or other disorders.
Knowledgeable informants are essential for identifying symptoms such as
irritability, mood dysregulation, aggression, eating problems, and sleep
problems, and for assessing adaptive functioning in various community
settings.

The most common co-occurring mental and neurodevelopmental disorders are
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; depressive and bipolar
disorders; anxiety disorders; autism spectrum disorder; stereotypic
movement disorder (with or without self-injurious behavior);
impulse-control disorders; and major neurocognitive disorder. Major
depressive disorder may occur throughout the range of severity of
intellectual disability. Self-injurious behavior requires prompt
diagnostic attention and may warrant a separate diagnosis of stereotypic
movement disorder. Individuals with intellectual disability,
particularly those with more severe intellectual disability, may also
exhibit aggression and disruptive behaviors, including harm of others or
property destruction.

Relationship to Other Classifications

ICD-11 (in development at the time of this publication) uses the term
*intellectual developmental disorders* to indicate that these are
disorders that involve impaired brain functioning early in life. These
disorders are described in ICD-11 as a metasyndrome occurring in the
developmental period analogous to dementia or neurocognitive disorder in
later life.

There are four subtypes in ICD-11: mild, moderate, severe, and profound.

The American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
(AAIDD) also uses the term *intellectual disability* with a similar
meaning to the term as used in this

[]{#index_split_012.html#p86}Global Developmental Delay

**41**

manual. The AAIDD's classification is multidimensional rather than
categorical and is based on the disability construct. Rather than
listing specifiers as is done in DSM-5, the AAIDD emphasizes a profile
of supports based on severity.

Global Developmental Delay

**315.8 (F88)**

This diagnosis is reserved for individuals *under* the age of 5 years
when the clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed during
early childhood. This category is diagnosed when an individual fails to
meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual
functioning, and applies to individuals who are unable to undergo
systematic assessments of intellectual functioning, including children
who are too young to participate in standardized testing. This category
requires reassessment after a period of time.

Unspecified Intellectual Disability

(Intellectual Developmental Disorder)

**319 (F79)**

This category is reserved for individuals *over* the age of 5 years when
assessment of the degree of intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder) by means of locally available procedures is
rendered difficult or impossible because of associated sensory or
physical impairments, as in blindness or prelingual deafness; locomotor
disability; or presence of severe problem behaviors or co-occurring
mental disorder. This category should only be used in exceptional
circumstances and requires reassessment after a period of time.

**Communication Disorders**

Disorders of communication include deficits in language, speech, and
communication.

*Speech* is the expressive production of sounds and includes an
individual's articulation, fluency, voice, and resonance quality.
*Language* includes the form, function, and use of a conventional system
of symbols (i.e., spoken words, sign language, written words, pictures)
in a rule-governed manner for communication. *Communication* includes
any verbal or nonverbal behavior (whether intentional or unintentional)
that influences the behavior, ideas, or attitudes of another individual.
Assessments of speech, language and communication abilities must take
into account the individual\'s cultural and language context,
particularly for individuals growing up in bilingual environments. The
standardized measures of language development and of nonverbal
intellectual capacity must be relevant for the cultural and linguistic
group (i.e., tests developed and standardized for one group may not
provide appropriate norms for a different group). The diagnostic
category of communication disorders includes the following: language
disorder, speech sound disorder, childhood-onset fluency disorder
(stuttering), social (pragmatic) communication disorder, and other
specified and unspecified communication disorders.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p87}**42**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Language Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**315.32 (F80.2)**

A. Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across
modalities (i.e., spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to
deficits in comprehension or production that include the following:

1\. Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use).

2\. Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word endings
together to form sentences based on the rules of grammar and
morphology).

3\. Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and connect
sentences to explain or describe a topic or series of events or have a
conversation).

B. Language abilities are substantially and quantifiably below those
expected for age, resulting in functional limitations in effective
communication, social participation, academic achievement, or
occupational performance, individually or in any combination.

C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.

D. The difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory
impairment, motor dysfunction, or another medical or neurological
condition and are not better explained by intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay.

Diagnostic Features

The core diagnostic features of language disorder are difficulties in
the acquisition and use of language due to deficits in the comprehension
or production of vocabulary, sentence structure, and discourse. The
language deficits are evident in spoken communication, written
communication, or sign language. Language learning and use is dependent
on both receptive and expressive skills. *Expressive ability* refers to
the production of vocal, gestural, or verbal signals, while *receptive
ability* refers to the process of receiving and comprehending language
messages. Language skills need to be assessed in both expressive and
receptive modalities as these may differ in severity. For example, an
individual's expressive language may be severely impaired, while his
receptive language is hardly impaired at all.

Language disorder usually affects vocabulary and grammar, and these
effects then limit the capacity for discourse. The child's first words
and phrases are likely to be delayed in onset; vocabulary size is
smaller and less varied than expected; and sentences are shorter and
less complex with grammatical errors, especially in past tense. Deficits
in comprehension of language are frequently underestimated, as children
may be good at using context to infer meaning. There may be word-finding
problems, impoverished verbal definitions, or poor understanding of
synonyms, multiple meanings, or word play appropriate for age and
culture. Problems with remembering new words and sentences are
manifested by difficulties following instructions of increasing length,
difficulties rehears-ing strings of verbal information (e.g.,
remembering a phone number or a shopping list), and difficulties
remembering novel sound sequences, a skill that may be important for
learning new words. Difficulties with discourse are shown by a reduced
ability to provide adequate information about the key events and to
narrate a coherent story.

The language difficulty is manifest by abilities substantially and
quantifiably below that expected for age and significantly interfering
with academic achievement, occupational performance, effective
communication, or socialization (Criterion B). A diagnosis of language
disorder is made based on the synthesis of the individual's history,
direct clinical observation in different contexts (i.e., home, school,
or work), and scores from standardized tests of language ability that
can be used to guide estimates of severity.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p88}Language Disorder

**43**

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A positive family history of language disorders is often present.
Individuals, even children, can be adept at accommodating to their
limited language. They may appear to be shy or reticent to talk.
Affected individuals may prefer to communicate only with family members
or other familiar individuals. Although these social indicators are not
diagnostic of a language disorder, if they are notable and persistent,
they warrant referral for a full language assessment. Language disorder,
particularly expressive deficits, may co-occur with speech sound
disorder.

Development and Course

Language acquisition is marked by changes from onset in toddlerhood to
the adult level of competency that appears during adolescence. Changes
appear across the dimensions of language (sounds, words, grammar,
narratives/expository texts, and conversational skills) in age-graded
increments and synchronies. Language disorder emerges during the early
developmental period; however, there is considerable variation in early
vocabulary acquisition and early word combinations, and individual
differences are not, as single indicators, highly predictive of later
outcomes. By age 4 years, individual differences in language ability are
more stable, with better measurement accuracy, and are highly predictive
of later outcomes. Language disorder diagnosed from 4 years of age is
likely to be stable over time and typically persists into adulthood,
although the particular profile of language strengths and deficits is
likely to change over the course of development.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Children with receptive language impairments have a poorer prognosis
than those with predominantly expressive impairments. They are more
resistant to treatment, and difficulties with reading comprehension are
frequently seen.

Genetic and physiological.

Language disorders are highly heritable, and family members are more
likely to have a history of language impairment.

Differential Diagnosis

Normal variations in language.

Language disorder needs to be distinguished from normal developmental
variations, and this distinction may be difficult to make before 4 years
of age. Regional, social, or cultural/ethnic variations of language
(e.g., dialects) must be considered when an individual is being assessed
for language impairment.

Hearing or other sensory impairment.

Hearing impairment needs to be excluded as the

primary cause of language difficulties. Language deficits may be
associated with a hearing impairment, other sensory deficit, or a
speech-motor deficit. When language deficits are in excess of those
usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of language disorder
may be made.

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).

Language delay is often the

presenting feature of intellectual disability, and the definitive
diagnosis may not be made until the child is able to complete
standardized assessments. A separate diagnosis is not given unless the
language deficits are clearly in excess of the intellectual limitations.

Neurological disorders.

Language disorder can be acquired in association with neurological
disorders, including epilepsy (e.g., acquired aphasia or Landau-Kleffner
syndrome).

Language regression.

Loss of speech and language in a child younger than 3 years may be a
sign of autism spectrum disorder (with developmental regression) or a
specific neurological condition, such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Among
children older than 3 years, language loss may be a symptom of seizures,
and a diagnostic assessment is necessary to exclude the presence of
epilepsy (e.g., routine and sleep electroencephalogram).

[]{#index_split_012.html#p89}**44**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Comorbidity

Language disorder is strongly associated with other neurodevelopmental
disorders in terms of specific learning disorder (literacy and
numeracy), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum
disorder, and developmental coordination disorder. It is also associated
with social (pragmatic) communication disorder. A positive family
history of speech or language disorders is often present.

Speech Sound Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**315.39 (F80.0)**

A. Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes
with speech intelligibility or prevents verbal communication of
messages.

B. The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that
interfere with social participation, academic achievement, or
occupational performance, individually or in any combination.

C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.

D. The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired
conditions, such as cerebral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing
loss, traumatic brain injury, or other medical or neurological
conditions.

Diagnostic Features

Speech sound production describes the clear articulation of the phonemes
(i.e., individual sounds) that in combination make up spoken words.
Speech sound production requires both the phonological knowledge of
speech sounds and the ability to coordinate the movements of the
articulators (i.e., the jaw, tongue, and lips,) with breathing and
vocalizing for speech. Children with speech production difficulties may
experience difficulty with phonological knowledge of speech sounds or
the ability to coordinate movements for speech in varying degrees.

Speech sound disorder is thus heterogeneous in its underlying mechanisms
and includes phonological disorder and articulation disorder. A speech
sound disorder is diagnosed when speech sound production is not what
would be expected based on the child's age and developmental stage and
when the deficits are not the result of a physical, structural,
neurological, or hearing impairment. Among typically developing children
at age 4 years, overall speech should be intelligible, whereas at age 2
years, only 50% may be understandable.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Language disorder, particularly expressive deficits, may be found to
co-occur with speech sound disorder. A positive family history of speech
or language disorders is often present.

If the ability to rapidly coordinate the articulators is a particular
aspect of difficulty, there may be a history of delay or incoordination
in acquiring skills that also utilize the articulators and related
facial musculature; among others, these skills include chewing,
maintaining mouth closure, and blowing the nose. Other areas of motor
coordination may be impaired as in developmental coordination disorder.
*Verbal dyspraxia* is a term also used for speech production problems.

Speech may be differentially impaired in certain genetic conditions
(e.g., Down syndrome, 22q deletion, *FoxP2* gene mutation). If present,
these should also be coded.

Development and Course

Learning to produce speech sounds clearly and accurately and learning to
produce connected speech fluently are developmental skills. Articulation
of speech sounds follows a

[]{#index_split_012.html#p90}Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder
(Stuttering) **45**

developmental pattern, which is reflected in the age norms of
standardized tests. It is not unusual for typically developing children
to use developmental processes for shortening words and syllables as
they are learning to talk, but their progression in mastering speech
sound production should result in mostly intelligible speech by age 3
years. Children with speech sound disorder continue to use immature
phonological simplification processes past the age when most children
can produce words clearly.

Most speech sounds should be produced clearly and most words should be
pronounced accurately according to age and community norms by age 7
years. The most frequently misarticulated sounds also tend to be learned
later, leading them to be called the "late eight" ( *l,* *r,* *s,* *z,*
*th,* *ch,* *dzh,* and *zh*). Misarticulation of any of these sounds by
itself could be considered within normal limits up to age 8 years. When
multiple sounds are involved, it may be appropriate to target some of
those sounds as part of a plan to improve intelligibility prior to the
age at which almost all children can produce them accurately. Lisping
(i.e., misarticulating sibi-lants) is particularly common and may
involve frontal or lateral patterns of airstream direction. It may be
associated with an abnormal tongue-thrust swallowing pattern.

Most children with speech sound disorder respond well to treatment, and
speech difficulties improve over time, and thus the disorder may not be
lifelong. However, when a language disorder is also present, the speech
disorder has a poorer prognosis and may be associated with specific
learning disorders.

Differential Diagnosis

Normal variations in speech.

Regional, social, or cultural/ethnic variations of speech should be
considered before making the diagnosis.

Hearing or other sensory impairment.

Hearing impairment or deafness may result in

abnormalities of speech. Deficits of speech sound production may be
associated with a hearing impairment, other sensory deficit, or a
speech-motor deficit. When speech deficits are in excess of those
usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of speech sound
disorder may be made.

Structural deficits.

Speech impairment may be due to structural deficits (e.g., cleft
palate).

Dysarthria.

Speech impairment may be attributable to a motor disorder, such as
cerebral palsy. Neurological signs, as well as distinctive features of
voice, differentiate dysarthria from speech sound disorder, although in
young children (under 3 years) differentiation may be difficult,
particularly when there is no or minimal general body motor involvement
(as in, e.g., Worster-Drought syndrome).

Selective mutism.

Limited use of speech may be a sign of selective mutism, an anxiety
disorder that is characterized by a lack of speech in one or more
contexts or settings. Selective mutism may develop in children with a
speech disorder because of embarassment about their impairments, but
many children with selective mutism exhibit normal speech in "safe"
settings, such as at home or with close friends.

Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)

Diagnostic Criteria

**315.35 (F80.81)**

A. Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that
are inappropriate for the individual's age and language skills, persist
over time, and are characterized by frequent and marked occurrences of
one (or more) of the following: 1. Sound and syllable repetitions.

2\. Sound prolongations of consonants as well as vowels.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p91}**46**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

3\. Broken words (e.g., pauses within a word).

4\. Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech).

5\. Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic words).

6\. Words produced with an excess of physical tension.

7\. Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., "I-I-I-I see him").

B. The disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in
effective communication, social participation, or academic or
occupational performance, individually or in any combination.

C. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.
(**Note:** Later-onset cases are diagnosed as 307.0 \[F98.5\]
adult-onset fluency disorder.) D. The disturbance is not attributable to
a speech-motor or sensory deficit, dysfluency associated with
neurological insult (e.g., stroke, tumor, trauma), or another medical
condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering)
is a disturbance in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech
that is inappropriate for the individual's age. This disturbance is
characterized by frequent repetitions or prolongations of sounds or
syllables and by other types of speech dysfluencies, including broken
words (e.g., pauses within a word), audible or silent blocking (i.e.,
filled or unfilled pauses in speech), circumlocutions (i.e., word
substitutions to avoid problematic words), words produced with an excess
of physical tension, and monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g.,
"I-I-I-I see him"). The disturbance in fluency interferes with academic
or occupational achievement or with social communication. The extent of
the disturbance varies from situation to situation and often is more
severe when there is special pressure to communicate (e.g., giving a
report at school, interviewing for a job). Dysfluency is often absent
during oral reading, singing, or talking to inanimate objects or to
pets.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Fearful anticipation of the problem may develop. The speaker may attempt
to avoid dysfluencies by linguistic mechanisms (e.g., altering the rate
of speech, avoiding certain words or sounds) or by avoiding certain
speech situations, such as telephoning or public speaking. In addition
to being features of the condition, stress and anxiety have been shown
to exacerbate dysfluency.

Childhood-onset fluency disorder may also be accompanied by motor
movements (e.g., eye blinks, tics, tremors of the lips or face, jerking
of the head, breathing movements, fist clenching). Children with fluency
disorder show a range of language abilities, and the relationship
between fluency disorder and language abilities is unclear.

Development and Course

Childhood-onset fluency disorder, or developmental stuttering, occurs by
age 6 for 80%--

90% of affected individuals, with age at onset ranging from 2 to 7
years. The onset can be insidious or more sudden. Typically,
dysfluencies start gradually, with repetition of initial consonants,
first words of a phrase, or long words. The child may not be aware of
dysfluencies. As the disorder progresses, the dysfluencies become more
frequent and interfering, occurring on the most meaningful words or
phrases in the utterance. As the child becomes aware of the speech
difficulty, he or she may develop mechanisms for avoiding the
dysfluencies and emotional responses, including avoidance of public
speaking and use of short and simple utterances. Longitudinal research
shows that 65%--85% of children re-

[]{#index_split_012.html#p92}Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder
**47**

cover from the dysfluency, with severity of fluency disorder at age 8
years predicting recovery or persistence into adolescence and beyond.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

The risk of stuttering among first-degree biological relatives of
individuals with childhood-onset fluency disorder is more than three
times the risk in the general population.

Functional Consequences of

Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)

In addition to being features of the condition, stress and anxiety can
exacerbate dysfluency. Impairment of social functioning may result from
this anxiety.

Differential Diagnosis

Sensory deficits.

Dysfluencies of speech may be associated with a hearing impairment or
other sensory deficit or a speech-motor deficit. When the speech
dysfluencies are in excess of those usually associated with these
problems, a diagnosis of childhood-onset fluency disorder may be made.

Normal speech dysfluencies.

The disorder must be distinguished from normal dysfluencies that occur
frequently in young children, which include whole-word or phrase
repetitions (e.g., "I want, I want ice cream"), incomplete phrases,
interjections, unfilled pauses, and parenthetical remarks. If these
difficulties increase in frequency or complexity as the child grows
older, a diagnosis of childhood-onset fluency disorder is appropriate.

Medication side effects.

Stuttering may occur as a side effect of medication and may be detected
by a temporal relationship with exposure to the medication.

Adult-onset dysfluencies.

If onset of dysfluencies is during or after adolescence, it is an

"adult-onset dysfluency" rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder.
Adult-onset dysfluencies are associated with specific neurological
insults and a variety of medical conditions and mental disorders and may
be specified with them, but they are not a DSM-5 diagnosis.

Tourette's disorder.

Vocal tics and repetitive vocalizations of Tourette's disorder should be
distinguishable from the repetitive sounds of childhood-onset fluency
disorder by their nature and timing.

Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**315.39 (F80.89)**

A. Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal
communication as manifested by all of the following:

1\. Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as
greeting and sharing information, in a manner that is appropriate for
the social context.

2\. Impairment of the ability to change communication to match context
or the needs of the listener, such as speaking differently in a
classroom than on a playground, talking differently to a child than to
an adult, and avoiding use of overly formal language.

3\. Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling, such
as taking turns in conversation, rephrasing when misunderstood, and
knowing how to use verbal and nonverbal signals to regulate interaction.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p93}**48**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

4\. Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g.,
making inferences) and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language
(e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors, multiple meanings that depend on the
context for interpretation).

B. The deficits result in functional limitations in effective
communication, social participation, social relationships, academic
achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in
combination.

C. The onset of the symptoms is in the early developmental period (but
deficits may not become fully manifest until social communication
demands exceed limited capacities).

D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological
condition or to low abilities in the domains of word structure and
grammar, and are not better explained by autism spectrum disorder,
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), global
developmental delay, or another mental disorder.

Diagnostic Features

Social (pragmatic) communication disorder is characterized by a primary
difficulty with pragmatics, or the social use of language and
communication, as manifested by deficits in understanding and following
social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in naturalistic
contexts, changing language according to the needs of the listener or
situation, and following rules for conversations and storytelling. The
deficits in social communication result in functional limitations in
effective communication, social participation, development of social
relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance. The
deficits are not better explained by low abilities in the domains of
structural language or cognitive ability.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The most common associated feature of social (pragmatic) communication
disorder is language impairment, which is characterized by a history of
delay in reaching language milestones, and historical, if not current,
structural language problems (see "Language Disorder"

earlier in this chapter). Individuals with social communication deficits
may avoid social interactions. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), behavioral problems, and specific learning disorders are also
more common among affected individuals.

Development and Course

Because social (pragmatic) communication depends on adequate
developmental progress in speech and language, diagnosis of social
(pragmatic) communication disorder is rare among children younger than 4
years. By age 4 or 5 years, most children should possess adequate speech
and language abilities to permit identification of specific deficits in
social communication. Milder forms of the disorder may not become
apparent until early adolescence, when language and social interactions
become more complex.

The outcome of social (pragmatic) communication disorder is variable,
with some children improving substantially over time and others
continuing to have difficulties persisting into adulthood. Even among
those who have significant improvements, the early deficits in
pragmatics may cause lasting impairments in social relationships and
behavior and also in acquisition of other related skills, such as
written expression.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

A family history of autism spectrum disorder, communication disorders,
or specific learning disorder appears to increase the risk for social
(pragmatic) communication disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Autism spectrum disorder.

Autism spectrum disorder is the primary diagnostic consideration for
individuals presenting with social communication deficits. The two
disorders can be differentiated by the presence in autism spectrum
disorder of restricted/

repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities and their
absence in social (pragmatic) communication disorder. Individuals with
autism spectrum disorder may only display the restricted/repetitive
patterns of behavior, interests, and activities during the early
developmental period, so a comprehensive history should be obtained.
Current absence of symptoms would not preclude a diagnosis of autism
spectrum disorder, if the restricted interests and repetitive behaviors
were present in the past. A diagnosis of social (pragmatic)
communication disorder should be considered only if the developmental
history fails to reveal any evidence of restricted/repetitive patterns
of behavior, interests, or activities.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Primary deficits of ADHD may cause impairments in social communication
and functional limitations of effective communication, social
participation, or academic achievement.

Social anxiety disorder (social phobia).

The symptoms of social communication disorder overlap with those of
social anxiety disorder. The differentiating feature is the timing of
the onset of symptoms. In social (pragmatic) communication disorder, the
individual has never had effective social communication; in social
anxiety disorder, the social communication skills developed
appropriately but are not utilized because of anxiety, fear, or distress
about social interactions.

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) and global
developmental delay.

Social communication skills may be deficient among individuals with
global developmental delay or intellectual disability, but a separate
diagnosis is not given unless the social communication deficits are
clearly in excess of the intellectual limitations.

Unspecified Communication Disorder

**307.9 (F80.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of communication disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
communication disorder or for any of the disorders in the
neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
communication disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for communication disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Diagnostic Criteria

**299.00 (F84.0)**

A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction
across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or
by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):

1\. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from
abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth
conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to
failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.

2\. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social
interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and
nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body
language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total
lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.

3\. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding
relationships, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting
behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing
imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers.

*Specify* current severity:

**Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted,
repetitive patterns of behavior** (seeTable 2).

B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or
activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or
by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):

1\. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech
(e.g., simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects,
echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).

2\. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or
ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme
distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking
patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat same food
every day).

3\. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity
or focus (e.g., strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual
objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests).

4\. Hyperor hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in
sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to
pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures,
excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with
lights or movement).

*Specify* current severity:

**Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted,
repetitive patterns of behavior** (see Table 2).

C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may
not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited
capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).

D. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p96}Autism Spectrum Disorder

**51**

E. These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual
disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental
delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently
co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and
intellectual disability, social communication should be below that
expected for general developmental level.

**Note:** Individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of
autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental
disorder not otherwise specified should be given the diagnosis of autism
spectrum disorder. Individuals who have marked deficits in social
communication, but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for
autism spectrum disorder, should be evaluated for social (pragmatic)
communication disorder.

*Specify* if:

**With or without accompanying intellectual impairment** **With or
without accompanying language impairment**

**Associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental
factor** (**Coding note:** Use additional code to identify the
associated medical or genetic condition.) **Associated with another
neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder** (**Coding note:**
Use additional code\[s\] to identify the associated neurodevelopmental,
mental, or behavioral disorder\[s\].)

**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with
another mental disorder, pp. 119--120, for definition) (**Coding note:**
Use additional code 293.89 \[F06.1\]

catatonia associated with autism spectrum disorder to indicate the
presence of the comorbid catatonia.)

Recording Procedures

For autism spectrum disorder that is associated with a known medical or
genetic condition or environmental factor, or with another
neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder, record autism
spectrum disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder, or
factor) (e.g., autism spectrum disorder associated with Rett syndrome).
Severity should be recorded as level of support needed for each of the
two psychopathological domains in Table 2 (e.g., "requiring very
substantial support for deficits in social communication and requiring
substantial support for restricted, repetitive behaviors").
Specification of "with accompanying intellectual impairment" or "without
accompanying intellectual impairment" should be recorded next. Language
impairment specification should be recorded thereafter. If there is
accompanying language impairment, the current level of verbal
functioning should be recorded (e.g., "with accompanying language
impairment---no intelligible speech" or "with accompanying language
impairment---phrase speech"). If catatonia is present, record separately
"catatonia associated with autism spectrum disorder."

Specifiers

The severity specifiers (see Table 2) may be used to describe succinctly
the current symptomatology (which might fall below level 1), with the
recognition that severity may vary by context and fluctuate over time.
Severity of social communication difficulties and restricted, repetitive
behaviors should be separately rated. The descriptive severity
categories should not be used to determine eligibility for and provision
of services; these can only be developed at an individual level and
through discussion of personal priorities and targets.

Regarding the specifier "with or without accompanying intellectual
impairment," understanding the (often uneven) intellectual profile of a
child or adult with autism spectrum disorder is necessary for
interpreting diagnostic features. Separate estimates of verbal and
nonverbal skill are necessary (e.g., using untimed nonverbal tests to
assess potential strengths in individuals with limited language).

**53**

To use the specifier "with or without accompanying language impairment,"
the current level of verbal functioning should be assessed and
described. Examples of the specific descriptions for "with accompanying
language impairment" might include no intelligible speech (nonverbal),
single words only, or phrase speech. Language level in individuals

"without accompanying language impairment" might be further described by
speaks in full sentences or has fluent speech. Since receptive language
may lag behind expressive language development in autism spectrum
disorder, receptive and expressive language skills should be considered
separately.

The specifier "associated with a known medical or genetic condition or
environmental factor" should be used when the individual has a known
genetic disorder (e.g., Rett syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Down
syndrome), a medical disorder (e.g. epilepsy), or a history of
environmental exposure (e.g., valproate, fetal alcohol syndrome, very
low birth weight).

Additional neurodevelopmental, mental or behavioral conditions should
also be noted (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder;
developmental coordination disorder; disruptive behavior,
impulse-control, or conduct disorders; anxiety, depressive, or bipolar
disorders; tics or Tourette's disorder; self-injury; feeding,
elimination, or sleep disorders).

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of autism spectrum disorder are persistent
impairment in reciprocal social communication and social interaction
(Criterion A), and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior,
interests, or activities (Criterion B). These symptoms are present from
early childhood and limit or impair everyday functioning (Criteria C and
D). The stage at which functional impairment becomes obvious will vary
according to characteristics of the individual and his or her
environment. Core diagnostic features are evident in the developmental
period, but intervention, compensation, and current supports may mask
difficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations of the disorder
also vary greatly depending on the severity of the autistic condition,
developmental level, and chronological age; hence, the term *spectrum.*
Autism spectrum disorder encompasses disorders previously referred to as
early infantile autism, childhood autism, Kanner's autism,
high-functioning autism, atypical autism, pervasive developmental
disorder not otherwise specified, childhood disintegrative disorder, and
Asperger's disorder.

The impairments in communication and social interaction specified in
Criterion A are pervasive and sustained. Diagnoses are most valid and
reliable when based on multiple sources of information, including
clinician's observations, caregiver history, and, when possible,
self-report. Verbal and nonverbal deficits in social communication have
varying manifestations, depending on the individual's age, intellectual
level, and language ability, as well as other factors such as treatment
history and current support. Many individuals have language deficits,
ranging from complete lack of speech through language delays, poor
comprehension of speech, echoed speech, or stilted and overly literal
language. Even when formal language skills (e.g., vocabulary, grammar)
are intact, the use of language for reciprocal social communication is
impaired in autism spectrum disorder.

Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity (i.e., the ability to engage
with others and share thoughts and feelings) are clearly evident in
young children with the disorder, who may show little or no initiation
of social interaction and no sharing of emotions, along with reduced or
absent imitation of others' behavior. What language exists is often
one-sided, lacking in social reciprocity, and used to request or label
rather than to comment, share feelings, or converse. In adults without
intellectual disabilities or language delays, deficits in
social-emotional reciprocity may be most apparent in difficulties
processing and responding to complex social cues (e.g., when and how to
join a conversation, what not to say). Adults who have developed
compensation strategies for some social challenges still struggle in
novel or unsupported situations and suffer from the effort and anxiety
of consciously calculating what is socially intuitive for most
individuals.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p99}**54**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social
interaction are manifested by absent, reduced, or atypical use of eye
contact (relative to cultural norms), gestures, facial expressions, body
orientation, or speech intonation. An early feature of autism spectrum
disorder is impaired joint attention as manifested by a lack of
pointing, showing, or bringing objects to share interest with others, or
failure to follow someone's pointing or eye gaze. Individuals may learn
a few functional gestures, but their repertoire is smaller than that of
others, and they often fail to use expressive gestures spontaneously in
communication. Among adults with fluent language, the difficulty in
coordinating nonverbal communication with speech may give the impression
of odd, wooden, or exaggerated "body language" during interactions.
Impairment may be relatively subtle within individual modes (e.g.,
someone may have relatively good eye contact when speaking) but
noticeable in poor integration of eye contact, gesture, body posture,
prosody, and facial expression for social communication.

Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships
should be judged against norms for age, gender, and culture. There may
be absent, reduced, or atypical social interest, manifested by rejection
of others, passivity, or inappropriate approaches that seem aggressive
or disruptive. These difficulties are particularly evident in young
children, in whom there is often a lack of shared social play and
imagination (e.g., age-appropriate flexible pretend play) and, later,
insistence on playing by very fixed rules.

Older individuals may struggle to understand what behavior is considered
appropriate in one situation but not another (e.g., casual behavior
during a job interview), or the different ways that language may be used
to communicate (e.g., irony, white lies). There may be an apparent
preference for solitary activities or for interacting with much younger
or older people. Frequently, there is a desire to establish friendships
without a complete or realistic idea of what friendship entails (e.g.,
one-sided friendships or friendships based solely on shared special
interests). Relationships with siblings, coworkers, and caregivers are
also important to consider (in terms of reciprocity).

Autism spectrum disorder is also defined by restricted, repetitive
patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (as specified in
Criterion B), which show a range of manifestations according to age and
ability, intervention, and current supports. Stereotyped or repetitive
behaviors include simple motor stereotypies (e.g., hand flapping, finger
flicking), repetitive use of objects (e.g., spinning coins, lining up
toys), and repetitive speech (e.g., echolalia, the delayed or immediate
parroting of heard words; use of "you" when referring to self;
stereotyped use of words, phrases, or prosodic patterns). Excessive
adherence to routines and restricted patterns of behavior may be
manifest in resistance to change (e.g., distress at apparently small
changes, such as in packaging of a favorite food; insistence on
adherence to rules; rigidity of thinking) or ritualized patterns of
verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., repetitive questioning, pacing a
perimeter). Highly restricted, fixated interests in autism spectrum
disorder tend to be abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., a toddler
strongly attached to a pan; a child preoccupied with vacuum cleaners; an
adult spending hours writing out timetables). Some fascinations and
routines may relate to apparent hyperor hyporeactivity to sensory input,
manifested through extreme responses to specific sounds or textures,
excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights or
spinning objects, and sometimes apparent indifference to pain, heat, or
cold. Extreme reaction to or rituals involving taste, smell, texture, or
appearance of food or excessive food restrictions are common and may be
a presenting feature of autism spectrum disorder.

Many adults with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual or
language disabilities learn to suppress repetitive behavior in public.
Special interests may be a source of pleasure and motivation and provide
avenues for education and employment later in life.

Diagnostic criteria may be met when restricted, repetitive patterns of
behavior, interests, or activities were clearly present during childhood
or at some time in the past, even if symptoms are no longer present.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p100}Autism Spectrum Disorder

**55**

Criterion D requires that the features must cause clinically significant
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current
functioning. Criterion E specifies that the social communication
deficits, although sometimes accompanied by intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder), are not in line with the
individual's developmental level; impairments exceed difficulties
expected on the basis of developmental level.

Standardized behavioral diagnostic instruments with good psychometric
properties, including caregiver interviews, questionnaires and clinician
observation measures, are available and can improve reliability of
diagnosis over time and across clinicians.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder also have intellectual
impairment and/or language impairment (e.g., slow to talk, language
comprehension behind production). Even those with average or high
intelligence have an uneven profile of abilities. The gap between
intellectual and adaptive functional skills is often large. Motor
deficits are often present, including odd gait, clumsiness, and other
abnormal motor signs (e.g., walking on tiptoes). Self-injury (e.g., head
banging, biting the wrist) may occur, and disruptive/challenging
behaviors are more common in children and adolescents with autism
spectrum disorder than other disorders, including intellectual
disability. Adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder are
prone to anxiety and depression. Some individuals develop catatonic-like
motor behavior (slowing and "freezing" mid-action), but these are
typically not of the magnitude of a catatonic episode. However, it is
possible for individuals with autism spectrum disorder to experience a
marked deterioration in motor symptoms and display a full catatonic
episode with symptoms such as mutism, posturing, grimacing and waxy
flexibility.

The risk period for comorbid catatonia appears to be greatest in the
adolescent years.

Prevalence

In recent years, reported frequencies for autism spectrum disorder
across U.S. and nonU.S. countries have approached 1% of the population,
with similar estimates in child and adult samples. It remains unclear
whether higher rates reflect an expansion of the diagnostic criteria of
DSM-IV to include subthreshold cases, increased awareness, differences
in study methodology, or a true increase in the frequency of autism
spectrum disorder.

Development and Course

The age and pattern of onset also should be noted for autism spectrum
disorder. Symptoms are typically recognized during the second year of
life (12--24 months of age) but may be seen earlier than 12 months if
developmental delays are severe, or noted later than 24 months if
symptoms are more subtle. The pattern of onset description might include
information about early developmental delays or any losses of social or
language skills. In cases where skills have been lost, parents or
caregivers may give a history of a gradual or relatively rapid
deterioration in social behaviors or language skills. Typically, this
would occur between 12 and 24 months of age and is distinguished from
the rare instances of developmental regression occurring after at least
2 years of normal development (previously described as childhood
disintegrative disorder).

The behavioral features of autism spectrum disorder first become evident
in early childhood, with some cases presenting a lack of interest in
social interaction in the first year of life. Some children with autism
spectrum disorder experience developmental plateaus or regression, with
a gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or use
of language, often during the first 2 years of life. Such losses are
rare in other disorders and may be a useful "red flag" for autism
spectrum disorder. Much more unusual and warranting more extensive
medical investigation are losses of skills beyond social communication
(e.g., loss of self-care, toileting, motor skills) or those occurring
after the []{#index_split_012.html#p101}**56**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

second birthday (see also Rett syndrome in the section "Differential
Diagnosis" for this disorder).

First symptoms of autism spectrum disorder frequently involve delayed
language development, often accompanied by lack of social interest or
unusual social interactions (e.g., pulling individuals by the hand
without any attempt to look at them), odd play patterns (e.g., carrying
toys around but never playing with them), and unusual communication
patterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to own name).
Deafness may be suspected but is typically ruled out. During the second
year, odd and repetitive behaviors and the absence of typical play
become more apparent. Since many typically developing young children
have strong preferences and enjoy repetition (e.g., eating the same
foods, watching the same video multiple times), distinguishing
restricted and repetitive behaviors that are diagnostic of autism
spectrum disorder can be difficult in preschoolers. The clinical
distinction is based on the type, frequency, and intensity of the
behavior (e.g., a child who daily lines up objects for hours and is very
distressed if any item is moved).

Autism spectrum disorder is not a degenerative disorder, and it is
typical for learning and compensation to continue throughout life.
Symptoms are often most marked in early childhood and early school
years, with developmental gains typical in later childhood in at least
some areas (e.g., increased interest in social interaction). A small
proportion of individuals deteriorate behaviorally during adolescence,
whereas most others improve.

Only a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder live and
work independently in adulthood; those who do tend to have superior
language and intellectual abilities and are able to find a niche that
matches their special interests and skills. In general, individuals with
lower levels of impairment may be better able to function independently.

However, even these individuals may remain socially naive and
vulnerable, have difficulties organizing practical demands without aid,
and are prone to anxiety and depression.

Many adults report using compensation strategies and coping mechanisms
to mask their difficulties in public but suffer from the stress and
effort of maintaining a socially acceptable facade. Scarcely anything is
known about old age in autism spectrum disorder.

Some individuals come for first diagnosis in adulthood, perhaps prompted
by the diagnosis of autism in a child in the family or a breakdown of
relations at work or home. Obtaining detailed developmental history in
such cases may be difficult, and it is important to consider
self-reported difficulties. Where clinical observation suggests criteria
are currently met, autism spectrum disorder may be diagnosed, provided
there is no evidence of good social and communication skills in
childhood. For example, the report (by parents or another relative) that
the individual had ordinary and sustained reciprocal friendships and
good nonverbal communication skills throughout childhood would rule out
a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder; however, the absence of
developmental information in itself should not do so.

Manifestations of the social and communication impairments and
restricted/repetitive behaviors that define autism spectrum disorder are
clear in the developmental period.

In later life, intervention or compensation, as well as current
supports, may mask these difficulties in at least some contexts.
However, symptoms remain sufficient to cause current impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

The best established prognostic factors for individual outcome within
autism spectrum disorder are presence or absence of associated
intellectual disability and language impairment (e.g., functional
language by age 5 years is a good prognostic sign) and additional mental
health problems. Epilepsy, as a comorbid diagnosis, is associated with
greater intellectual disability and lower verbal ability.

Environmental.

A variety of nonspecific risk factors, such as advanced parental age,
low birth weight, or fetal exposure to valproate, may contribute to risk
of autism spectrum disorder.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p102}Autism Spectrum Disorder

**57**

Genetic and physiological.

Heritability estimates for autism spectrum disorder have ranged from 37%
to higher than 90%, based on twin concordance rates. Currently, as many
as 15% of cases of autism spectrum disorder appear to be associated with
a known genetic mutation, with different de novo copy number variants or
de novo mutations in specific genes associated with the disorder in
different families. However, even when an autism spectrum disorder is
associated with a known genetic mutation, it does not appear to be fully
penetrant. Risk for the remainder of cases appears to be polygenic, with
perhaps hundreds of genetic loci making relatively small contributions.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Cultural differences will exist in norms for social interaction,
nonverbal communication, and relationships, but individuals with autism
spectrum disorder are markedly impaired against the norms for their
cultural context. Cultural and socioeconomic factors may affect age at
recognition or diagnosis; for example, in the United States, late or
underdiagnosis of autism spectrum disorder among African American
children may occur.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed four times more often in males
than in females. In clinic samples, females tend to be more likely to
show accompanying intellectual disability, suggesting that girls without
accompanying intellectual impairments or language delays may go
unrecognized, perhaps because of subtler manifestation of social and
communication difficulties.

Functional Consequences of Autism Spectrum Disorder

In young children with autism spectrum disorder, lack of social and
communication abilities may hamper learning, especially learning through
social interaction or in settings with peers. In the home, insistence on
routines and aversion to change, as well as sensory sensitivities, may
interfere with eating and sleeping and make routine care (e.g.,
haircuts, dental work) extremely difficult. Adaptive skills are
typically below measured IQ. Extreme difficulties in planning,
organization, and coping with change negatively impact academic
achievement, even for students with above-average intelligence. During
adulthood, these individuals may have difficulties establishing
independence because of continued rigidity and difficulty with novelty.

Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder, even without
intellectual disability, have poor adult psychosocial functioning as
indexed by measures such as independent living and gainful employment.
Functional consequences in old age are unknown, but social isolation and
communication problems (e.g., reduced help-seeking) are likely to have
consequences for health in older adulthood.

Differential Diagnosis

Rett syndrome.

Disruption of social interaction may be observed during the regressive
phase of Rett syndrome (typically between 1--4 years of age); thus, a
substantial proportion of affected young girls may have a presentation
that meets diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder. However,
after this period, most individuals with Rett syndrome improve their
social communication skills, and autistic features are no longer a major
area of concern. Consequently, autism spectrum disorder should be
considered only when all diagnostic criteria are met.

Selective mutism.

In selective mutism, early development is not typically disturbed.

The affected child usually exhibits appropriate communication skills in
certain contexts and settings. Even in settings where the child is mute,
social reciprocity is not impaired, nor are restricted or repetitive
patterns of behavior present.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p103}**58**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Language disorders and social (pragmatic) communication disorder.

In some forms

of language disorder, there may be problems of communication and some
secondary social difficulties. However, specific language disorder is
not usually associated with abnormal nonverbal communication, nor with
the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests,
or activities.

When an individual shows impairment in social communication and social
interactions but does not show restricted and repetitive behavior or
interests, criteria for social (pragmatic) communication disorder,
instead of autism spectrum disorder, may be met. The diagnosis of autism
spectrum disorder supersedes that of social (pragmatic) communication
disorder whenever the criteria for autism spectrum disorder are met, and
care should be taken to enquire carefully regarding past or current
restricted/repetitive behavior.

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) without
autism spectrum disorder.

Intellectual disability without autism spectrum disorder may be
difficult to differentiate from autism spectrum disorder in very young
children. Individuals with intellectual disability who have not
developed language or symbolic skills also present a challenge for
differential diagnosis, since repetitive behavior often occurs in such
individuals as well. A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in an
individual with intellectual disability is appropriate when social
communication and interaction are significantly impaired relative to the
developmental level of the individual's nonverbal skills (e.g., fine
motor skills, nonverbal problem solving). In contrast, intellectual
disability is the appropriate diagnosis when there is no apparent
discrepancy between the level of social-communicative skills and other
intellectual skills.

Stereotypic movement disorder.

Motor stereotypies are among the diagnostic characteristics of autism
spectrum disorder, so an additional diagnosis of stereotypic movement
disorder is not given when such repetitive behaviors are better
explained by the presence of autism spectrum disorder. However, when
stereotypies cause self-injury and become a focus of treatment, both
diagnoses may be appropriate.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Abnormalities of attention (overly focused or

easily distracted) are common in individuals with autism spectrum
disorder, as is hyperactivity. A diagnosis of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should be considered
when attentional difficulties or hyperactivity exceeds that typically
seen in individuals of comparable mental age.

Schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia with childhood onset usually develops after a period of
normal, or near normal, development. A prodromal state has been
described in which social impairment and atypical interests and beliefs
occur, which could be confused with the social deficits seen in autism
spectrum disorder. Hallucinations and delusions, which are defining
features of schizophrenia, are not features of autism spectrum disorder.
However, clinicians must take into account the potential for individuals
with autism spectrum disorder to be concrete in their interpretation of
questions regarding the key features of schizophrenia (e.g., "Do you
hear voices when no one is there?" "Yes \[on the radio\]").

Comorbidity

Autism spectrum disorder is frequently associated with intellectual
impairment and structural language disorder (i.e., an inability to
comprehend and construct sentences with proper grammar), which should be
noted under the relevant specifiers when applicable. Many individuals
with autism spectrum disorder have psychiatric symptoms that do not form
part of the diagnostic criteria for the disorder (about 70% of
individuals with autism spectrum disorder may have one comorbid mental
disorder, and 40% may have two or more comorbid mental disorders). When
criteria for both ADHD and autism spectrum disorder are met, both
diagnoses should be given. This same principle applies to concurrent
diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and developmental coordination
disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive
[]{#index_split_012.html#p104}Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
**59**

disorders, and other comorbid diagnoses. Among individuals who are
nonverbal or have language deficits, observable signs such as changes in
sleep or eating and increases in challenging behavior should trigger an
evaluation for anxiety or depression. Specific learning difficulties
(literacy and numeracy) are common, as is developmental coordination
disorder.

Medical conditions commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder
should be noted under the "associated with a known medical/genetic or
environmental/acquired condition"

specifier. Such medical conditions include epilepsy, sleep problems, and
constipation.

Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is a fairly frequent
presenting feature of autism spectrum disorder, and extreme and narrow
food preferences may persist.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity
that interferes with functioning or development, as characterized by (1)
and/or (2): 1. **Inattention:** Six (or more) of the following symptoms
have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent
with developmental level and that negatively impacts directly on social
and academic/occupational activities: **Note:** The symptoms are not
solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or
failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and
adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.

a\. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless
mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g.,
overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate).

b\. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play
activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining focused during lectures,
conversations, or lengthy reading).

c\. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g., mind
seems elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious distraction).

d\. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish
schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but
quickly loses focus and is easily sidetracked).

e\. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g.,
difficulty managing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and
belongings in order; messy, disorganized work; has poor time management;
fails to meet deadlines).

Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require
sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older
adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing
lengthy papers).

g\. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school
materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses,
mobile telephones).

h\. Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older
adolescents and adults, may include unrelated thoughts).

i\.

Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running
errands; for older adolescents and adults, returning calls, paying
bills, keeping appointments).

defiance, hostility, or a failure to understand tasks or instructions.
For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five
symptoms are required.

a\. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat.

unable to be or uncomfortable being still for extended time, as in
restaurants, meetings; may be experienced by others as being restless or
difficult to keep up with).

f\.

Often talks excessively.

g\. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed
(e.g., completes people's sentences; cannot wait for turn in
conversation).

h\. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in
line).

i\.

Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations,
games, or activities; may start using other people's things without
asking or receiving permission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude
into or take over what others are doing).

B. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present
prior to age 12 years.

C. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in
two or more settings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or
relatives; in other activities).

D. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce
the quality of, social, academic, or occupational functioning.

E. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of
schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder and are not better explained
by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder,
dissociative disorder, personality disorder, substance intoxication or
withdrawal).

occupational functioning.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
is a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity
that interferes with functioning or development. *Inattention* manifests
behaviorally in ADHD as wandering off task, lacking persistence, having
difficulty sustaining focus, and being disorganized and is not due to
defiance or lack of comprehension. *Hyperactivity* refers to excessive
motor activity (such as a child running about) when it is not
appropriate, or excessive fidgeting, tapping, or talkativeness. In
adults, hyperactivity may manifest as extreme restlessness or wearing
others out with their activity. *Impulsivity* refers to hasty actions
that occur in the moment without forethought and that have high
potential for harm to the individual (e.g., darting into the street
without looking). Impulsivity may reflect a desire for immediate rewards
or an inability to delay gratification. Impulsive behaviors may manifest
as social intrusiveness (e.g., interrupting others excessively) and/or
as making important decisions without consideration of long-term
consequences (e.g., taking a job without adequate information).

ADHD begins in childhood. The requirement that several symptoms be
present before age 12 years conveys the importance of a substantial
clinical presentation during childhood. At the same time, an earlier age
at onset is not specified because of difficulties in establishing
precise childhood onset retrospectively. Adult recall of childhood
symptoms tends to be unreliable, and it is beneficial to obtain
ancillary information.

Manifestations of the disorder must be present in more than one setting
(e.g., home and school, work). Confirmation of substantial symptoms
across settings typically cannot be done accurately without consulting
informants who have seen the individual in those settings. Typically,
symptoms vary depending on context within a given setting. Signs of the
disorder may be minimal or absent when the individual is receiving
frequent rewards for appropriate behavior, is under close supervision,
is in a novel setting, is engaged in especially interesting activities,
has consistent external stimulation (e.g., via electronic screens), or
is interacting in one-on-one situations (e.g., the clinician\'s office).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Mild delays in language, motor, or social development are not specific
to ADHD but often co-occur. Associated features may include low
frustration tolerance, irritability, or mood lability.

Even in the absence of a specific learning disorder, academic or work
performance is often impaired. Inattentive behavior is associated with
various underlying cognitive processes, and individuals with ADHD may
exhibit cognitive problems on tests of attention, executive function, or
memory, although these tests are not sufficiently sensitive or specific
to serve as diagnostic indices. By early adulthood, ADHD is associated
with an increased risk of suicide attempt, primarily when comorbid with
mood, conduct, or substance use disorders.

No biological marker is diagnostic for ADHD. As a group, compared with
peers, children with ADHD display increased slow wave
electroencephalograms, reduced total brain volume on magnetic resonance
imaging, and possibly a delay in posterior to anterior cortical
maturation, but these findings are not diagnostic. In the uncommon cases
where there is a known genetic cause (e.g., Fragile X syndrome, 22q11
deletion syndrome), the ADHD presentation should still be diagnosed.

Prevalence

Population surveys suggest that ADHD occurs in most cultures in about 5%
of children and about 2.5% of adults.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p107}**62**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Development and Course

Many parents first observe excessive motor activity when the child is a
toddler, but symptoms are difficult to distinguish from highly variable
normative behaviors before age 4

years. ADHD is most often identified during elementary school years, and
inattention becomes more prominent and impairing. The disorder is
relatively stable through early adolescence, but some individuals have a
worsened course with development of antisocial behaviors. In most
individuals with ADHD, symptoms of motoric hyperactivity become less
obvious in adolescence and adulthood, but difficulties with
restlessness, inattention, poor planning, and impulsivity persist. A
substantial proportion of children with ADHD

remain relatively impaired into adulthood.

In preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity. Inattention
becomes more prominent during elementary school. During adolescence,
signs of hyperactivity (e.g., running and climbing) are less common and
may be confined to fidgetiness or an inner feeling of jitteriness,
restlessness, or impatience. In adulthood, along with inattention and
restlessness, impulsivity may remain problematic even when hyperactivity
has diminished.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

ADHD is associated with reduced behavioral inhibition, effortful
control, or constraint; negative emotionality; and/or elevated novelty
seeking. These traits may predispose some children to ADHD but are not
specific to the disorder.

Environmental.

Very low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams) conveys a two-to threefold
risk for ADHD, but most children with low birth weight do not develop
ADHD. Although ADHD is correlated with smoking during pregnancy, some of
this association reflects common genetic risk. A minority of cases may
be related to reactions to aspects of diet. There may be a history of
child abuse, neglect, multiple foster placements, neurotoxin exposure
(e.g., lead), infections (e.g., encephalitis), or alcohol exposure in
utero. Exposure to environmental toxicants has been correlated with
subsequent ADHD, but it is not known whether these associations are
causal.

Genetic and physiological.

ADHD is elevated in the first-degree biological relatives of individuals
with ADHD. The heritability of ADHD is substantial. While specific genes
have been correlated with ADHD, they are neither necessary nor
sufficient causal factors.

Visual and hearing impairments, metabolic abnormalities, sleep
disorders, nutritional deficiencies, and epilepsy should be considered
as possible influences on ADHD symptoms.

ADHD is not associated with specific physical features, although rates
of minor physical anomalies (e.g., hypertelorism, highly arched palate,
low-set ears) may be relatively elevated. Subtle motor delays and other
neurological soft signs may occur. (Note that marked co-occurring
clumsiness and motor delays should be coded separately \[e.g.,
developmental coordination disorder\].)

Course modifiers.

Family interaction patterns in early childhood are unlikely to cause
ADHD but may influence its course or contribute to secondary development
of conduct problems.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Differences in ADHD prevalence rates across regions appear attributable
mainly to different diagnostic and methodological practices. However,
there also may be cultural variation in attitudes toward or
interpretations of children's behaviors. Clinical identification rates
in the United States for African American and Latino populations tend to
be lower than for Caucasian populations. Informant symptom ratings may
be influenced by cultural group of the child and the informant,
suggesting that culturally appropriate practices are relevant in
assessing ADHD.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p108}Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
**63**

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

ADHD is more frequent in males than in females in the general
population, with a ratio of approximately 2:1 in children and 1.6:1 in
adults. Females are more likely than males to present primarily with
inattentive features.

Functional Consequences of

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

ADHD is associated with reduced school performance and academic
attainment, social rejection, and, in adults, poorer occupational
performance, attainment, attendance, and higher probability of
unemployment as well as elevated interpersonal conflict. Children with
ADHD are significantly more likely than their peers without ADHD to
develop conduct disorder in adolescence and antisocial personality
disorder in adulthood, consequently increasing the likelihood for
substance use disorders and incarceration. The risk of subsequent
substance use disorders is elevated, especially when conduct disorder or
antisocial personality disorder develops. Individuals with ADHD are more
likely than peers to be injured. Traffic accidents and violations are
more frequent in drivers with ADHD.

There may be an elevated likelihood of obesity among individuals with
ADHD.

Inadequate or variable self-application to tasks that require sustained
effort is often interpreted by others as laziness, irresponsibility, or
failure to cooperate. Family relationships may be characterized by
discord and negative interactions. Peer relationships are often
disrupted by peer rejection, neglect, or teasing of the individual with
ADHD. On average, individuals with ADHD obtain less schooling, have
poorer vocational achievement, and have reduced intellectual scores than
their peers, although there is great variability. In its severe form,
the disorder is markedly impairing, affecting social, familial, and
scholastic/occupational adjustment.

Academic deficits, school-related problems, and peer neglect tend to be
most associated with elevated symptoms of inattention, whereas peer
rejection and, to a lesser extent, accidental injury are most salient
with marked symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity.

Differential Diagnosis

Oppositional defiant disorder.

Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder may resist work or school
tasks that require self-application because they resist conforming to
others\' demands. Their behavior is characterized by negativity,
hostility, and defiance.

These symptoms must be differentiated from aversion to school or
mentally demanding tasks due to difficulty in sustaining mental effort,
forgetting instructions, and impulsivity in individuals with ADHD.
Complicating the differential diagnosis is the fact that some
individuals with ADHD may develop secondary oppositional attitudes
toward such tasks and devalue their importance.

Intermittent explosive disorder.

ADHD and intermittent explosive disorder share high

levels of impulsive behavior. However, individuals with intermittent
explosive disorder show serious aggression toward others, which is not
characteristic of ADHD, and they do not experience problems with
sustaining attention as seen in ADHD. In addition, intermittent
explosive disorder is rare in childhood. Intermittent explosive disorder
may be diagnosed in the presence of ADHD.

Other neurodevelopmental disorders.

The increased motoric activity that may occur in

ADHD must be distinguished from the repetitive motor behavior that
characterizes stereotypic movement disorder and some cases of autism
spectrum disorder. In stereotypic movement disorder, the motoric
behavior is generally fixed and repetitive (e.g., body rocking,
self-biting), whereas the fidgetiness and restlessness in ADHD are
typically generalized and not characterized by repetitive stereotypic
movements. In Tourette's disorder, []{#index_split_012.html#p109}**64**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

frequent multiple tics can be mistaken for the generalized fidgetiness
of ADHD. Prolonged observation may be needed to differentiate
fidgetiness from bouts of multiple tics.

Specific learning disorder.

Children with specific learning disorder may appear inattentive because
of frustration, lack of interest, or limited ability. However,
inattention in individuals with a specific learning disorder who do not
have ADHD is not impairing outside of academic work.

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).

Symptoms of ADHD are

common among children placed in academic settings that are inappropriate
to their intellectual ability. In such cases, the symptoms are not
evident during non-academic tasks. A diagnosis of ADHD in intellectual
disability requires that inattention or hyperactivity be excessive for
mental age.

Autism spectrum disorder.

Individuals with ADHD and those with autism spectrum

disorder exhibit inattention, social dysfunction, and
difficult-to-manage behavior. The social dysfunction and peer rejection
seen in individuals with ADHD must be distinguished from the social
disengagement, isolation, and indifference to facial and tonal
communication cues seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorder.
Children with autism spectrum disorder may display tantrums because of
an inability to tolerate a change from their expected course of events.
In contrast, children with ADHD may misbehave or have a tantrum during a
major transition because of impulsivity or poor self-control.

Reactive attachment disorder.

Children with reactive attachment disorder may show

social disinhibition, but not the full ADHD symptom cluster, and display
other features such as a lack of enduring relationships that are not
characteristic of ADHD.

Anxiety disorders.

ADHD shares symptoms of inattention with anxiety disorders. Individuals
with ADHD are inattentive because of their attraction to external
stimuli, new activities, or preoccupation with enjoyable activities.
This is distinguished from the inattention due to worry and rumination
seen in anxiety disorders. Restlessness might be seen in anxiety
disorders. However, in ADHD, the symptom is not associated with worry
and rumination.

Depressive disorders.

Individuals with depressive disorders may present with inability to
concentrate. However, poor concentration in mood disorders becomes
prominent only during a depressive episode.

Bipolar disorder.

Individuals with bipolar disorder may have increased activity, poor
concentration, and increased impulsivity, but these features are
episodic, occurring several days at a time. In bipolar disorder,
increased impulsivity or inattention is accompanied by elevated mood,
grandiosity, and other specific bipolar features. Children with ADHD may
show significant changes in mood within the same day; such lability is
distinct from a manic episode, which must last 4 or more days to be a
clinical indicator of bipolar disorder, even in children. Bipolar
disorder is rare in preadolescents, even when severe irritability and
anger are prominent, whereas ADHD is common among children and
adolescents who display excessive anger and irritability.

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is

characterized by pervasive irritability, and intolerance of frustration,
but impulsiveness and disorganized attention are not essential features.
However, most children and adolescents with the disorder have symptoms
that also meet criteria for ADHD, which is diagnosed separately.

Substance use disorders.

Differentiating ADHD from substance use disorders may be problematic if
the first presentation of ADHD symptoms follows the onset of abuse or
frequent use. Clear evidence of ADHD before substance misuse from
informants or previous records may be essential for differential
diagnosis.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p110}Other Specified
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder **65**

Personality disorders.

In adolescents and adults, it may be difficult to distinguish ADHD

from borderline, narcissistic, and other personality disorders. All
these disorders tend to share the features of disorganization, social
intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and cognitive dysregulation.
However, ADHD is not characterized by fear of abandonment, self-injury,
extreme ambivalence, or other features of personality disorder. It may
take extended clinical observation, informant interview, or detailed
history to distinguish impulsive, socially intrusive, or inappropriate
behavior from narcissistic, aggressive, or domineering behavior to make
this differential diagnosis.

Psychotic disorders.

ADHD is not diagnosed if the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity
occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic disorder.

Medication-induced symptoms of ADHD.

Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or

impulsivity attributable to the use of medication (e.g.,
bronchodilators, isoniazid, neuroleptics \[resulting in akathisia\],
thyroid replacement medication) are diagnosed as other specified or
unspecified other (or unknown) substance--related disorders.

Neurocognitive disorders.

Early major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and/or mild
neurocognitive disorder are not known to be associated with ADHD but may
present with similar clinical features. These conditions are
distinguished from ADHD by their late onset.

Comorbidity

In clinical settings, comorbid disorders are frequent in individuals
whose symptoms meet criteria for ADHD. In the general population,
oppositional defiant disorder co-occurs with ADHD in approximately half
of children with the combined presentation and about a quarter with the
predominantly inattentive presentation. Conduct disorder co-occurs in
about a quarter of children or adolescents with the combined
presentation, depending on age and setting. Most children and
adolescents with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have symptoms
that also meet criteria for ADHD; a lesser percentage of children with
ADHD have symptoms that meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder. Specific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with ADHD.
Anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder occur in a minority of
individuals with ADHD but more often than in the general population.
Intermittent explosive disorder occurs in a minority of adults with
ADHD, but at rates above population levels. Although substance use
disorders are relatively more frequent among adults with ADHD in the
general population, the disorders are present in only a minority of
adults with ADHD. In adults, antisocial and other personality disorders
may co-occur with ADHD. Other disorders that may co-occur with ADHD
include obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorders, and autism
spectrum disorder.

Other Specified Attention-Deficit/

Hyperactivity Disorder

**314.01 (F90.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the
disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The
other specified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate
[]{#index_split_012.html#p111}**66**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for
attention-deficit/

hyperactivity disorder or any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This
is done by recording "other specified attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "with insufficient
inattention symptoms").

Unspecified Attention-Deficit/

Hyperactivity Disorder

**314.01 (F90.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the
disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason
that the criteria are not met for attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes
presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis.

**Specific Learning Disorder**

Specific Learning Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. Difficulties learning and using academic skills, as indicated by the
presence of at least one of the following symptoms that have persisted
for at least 6 months, despite the provision of interventions that
target those difficulties: 1. Inaccurate or slow and effortful word
reading (e.g., reads single words aloud incorrectly or slowly and
hesitantly, frequently guesses words, has difficulty sounding out
words).

2\. Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g., may read
text accurately but not understand the sequence, relationships,
inferences, or deeper meanings of what is read).

3\. Difficulties with spelling (e.g., may add, omit, or substitute
vowels or consonants).

4\. Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple
grammatical or punctuation errors within sentences; employs poor
paragraph organization; written expression of ideas lacks clarity).

5\. Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation
(e.g., has poor understanding of numbers, their magnitude, and
relationships; counts on fingers to add single-digit numbers instead of
recalling the math fact as peers do; gets lost in the midst of
arithmetic computation and may switch procedures).

6\. Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g., has severe
difficulty applying mathematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve
quantitative problems).

[]{#index_split_012.html#p112}Specific Learning Disorder

**67**

B. The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below
those expected for the individual's chronological age, and cause
significant interference with academic or occupational performance, or
with activities of daily living, as confirmed by individually
administered standardized achievement measures and comprehensive
clinical assessment. For individuals age 17 years and older, a
documented history of impairing learning difficulties may be substituted
for the standardized assessment.

C. The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not
become fully manifest until the demands for those affected academic
skills exceed the individual's limited capacities (e.g., as in timed
tests, reading or writing lengthy complex reports for a tight deadline,
excessively heavy academic loads).

D. The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by
intellectual disabilities, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, other
mental or neurological disorders, psychosocial adversity, lack of
proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inadequate
educational instruction.

**Note:** The four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on a clinical
synthesis of the individual's history (developmental, medical, family,
educational), school reports, and psycho-educational assessment.

**Coding note:** Specify all academic domains and subskills that are
impaired. When more than one domain is impaired, each one should be
coded individually according to the following specifiers.

*Specify* if:

**315.00 (F81.0) With impairment in reading:**

Word reading accuracy

Reading rate or fluency

Reading comprehension

**Note:** *Dyslexia* is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern
of learning difficulties characterized by problems with accurate or
fluent word recognition, poor decoding, and poor spelling abilities. If
dyslexia is used to specify this particular pattern of difficulties, it
is important also to specify any additional difficulties that are
present, such as difficulties with reading comprehension or math
reasoning.

**315.2 (F81.81) With impairment in written expression:** Spelling
accuracy

Grammar and punctuation accuracy

Clarity or organization of written expression

**315.1 (F81.2) With impairment in mathematics:**

Number sense

Memorization of arithmetic facts

Accurate or fluent calculation

Accurate math reasoning

**Note:** *Dyscalculia* is an alternative term used to refer to a
pattern of difficulties characterized by problems processing numerical
information, learning arithmetic facts, and performing accurate or
fluent calculations. If dyscalculia is used to specify this particular
pattern of mathematic difficulties, it is important also to specify any
additional difficulties that are present, such as difficulties with math
reasoning or word reasoning accuracy.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Some difficulties learning skills in one or two academic
domains, but of mild enough severity that the individual may be able to
compensate or function well when provided with appropriate
accommodations or support services, especially during the school years.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p113}**68**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

**Moderate:** Marked difficulties learning skills in one or more
academic domains, so that the individual is unlikely to become
proficient without some intervals of intensive and specialized teaching
during the school years. Some accommodations or supportive services at
least part of the day at school, in the workplace, or at home may be
needed to complete activities accurately and efficiently.

**Severe:** Severe difficulties learning skills, affecting several
academic domains, so that the individual is unlikely to learn those
skills without ongoing intensive individualized and specialized teaching
for most of the school years. Even with an array of appropriate
accommodations or services at home, at school, or in the workplace, the
individual may not be able to complete all activities efficiently.

Recording Procedures

Each impaired academic domain and subskill of specific learning disorder
should be recorded. Because of ICD coding requirements, impairments in
reading, impairments in written expression, and impairments in
mathematics, with their corresponding impairments in subskills, must be
coded separately. For example, impairments in reading and mathematics
and impairments in the subskills of reading rate or fluency, reading
comprehension, accurate or fluent calculation, and accurate math
reasoning would be coded and recorded as 315.00 (F81.0) specific
learning disorder with impairment in reading, with impairment in reading
rate or fluency and impairment in reading comprehension; 315.1 (F81.2)
specific learning disorder with impairment in mathematics, with
impairment in accurate or fluent calculation and impairment in accurate
math reasoning.

Diagnostic Features

Specific learning disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a
biological origin that is the basis for abnormalities at a cognitive
level that are associated with the behavioral signs of the disorder. The
biological origin includes an interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and
environmental factors, which affect the brain's ability to perceive or
process verbal or nonverbal information efficiently and accurately.

One essential feature of specific learning disorder is persistent
difficulties learning keystone academic skills (Criterion A), with onset
during the years of formal schooling (i.e., the developmental period).
Key academic skills include reading of single words accurately and
fluently, reading comprehension, written expression and spelling,
arithmetic calculation, and mathematical reasoning (solving mathematical
problems). In contrast to talking or walking, which are acquired
developmental milestones that emerge with brain maturation, academic
skills (e.g., reading, spelling, writing, mathematics) have to be taught
and learned explicitly.

Specific learning disorder disrupts the normal pattern of learning
academic skills; it is not simply a consequence of lack of opportunity
of learning or inadequate instruction. Difficulties mastering these key
academic skills may also impede learning in other academic subjects
(e.g., history, science, social studies), but those problems are
attributable to difficulties learning the underlying academic skills.
Difficulties learning to map letters with the sounds of one's
language---to read printed words (often called *dyslexia*)---is one of
the most common manifestations of specific learning disorder. The
learning difficulties manifest as a range of observable, descriptive
behaviors or symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1--A6). These clinical
symptoms may be observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or
ascertained from school reports, rating scales, or descriptions in
previous educational or psychological assessments. The learning
difficulties are persistent, not transitory. In children and
adolescents, *persistence* is defined as restricted progress in learning
(i.e., no evidence that the individual is catching up with class-mates)
for at least 6 months despite the provision of extra help at home or
school. For example, difficulties learning to read single words that do

learning disorder. Evidence of persistent learning difficulties may be
derived from cumulative school reports, portfolios of the child's
evaluated work, curriculum-based measures, or clinical interview. In
adults, persistent difficulty refers to ongoing difficulties in literacy
or numeracy skills that manifest during childhood or adolescence, as
indicated by cumulative evidence from school reports, evaluated
portfolios of work, or previous assessments.

A second key feature is that the individual's performance of the
affected academic skills is well below average for age (Criterion B).
One robust clinical indicator of difficulties learning academic skills
is low academic achievement for age or average achievement that is
sustain-able only by extraordinarily high levels of effort or support.
In children, the low academic skills cause significant interference in
school performance (as indicated by school reports and teacher's grades
or ratings). Another clinical indicator, particularly in adults, is
avoidance of activities that require the academic skills. Also in
adulthood, low academic skills interfere with occupational performance
or everyday activities requiring those skills (as indicated by
self-report or report by others). However, this criterion also requires
psychometric evidence from an individually administered,
psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate test of academic
achievement that is norm-referenced or criterion-referenced. Academic
skills are distributed along a continuum, so there is no natural
cutpoint that can be used to differentiate individuals with and without
specific learning disorder. Thus, any threshold used to specify what
constitutes significantly low academic achievement (e.g., academic
skills well below age expectation) is to a large extent arbitrary. Low
achievement scores on one or more standardized tests or subtests within
an academic domain (i.e., at least 1.5 standard deviations \[SD\] below
the population mean for age, which translates to a standard score of 78
or less, which is below the 7th percentile) are needed for the greatest
diagnostic certainty. However, precise scores will vary according to the
particular standardized tests that are used. On the basis of clinical
judgment, a more lenient threshold may be used (e.g., 1.0--2.5 SD below
the population mean for age), when learning difficulties are supported
by converging evidence from clinical assessment, academic history,
school reports, or test scores. Moreover, since standardized tests are
not available in all languages, the diagnosis may then be based in part
on clinical judgment of scores on available test measures.

A third core feature is that the learning difficulties are readily
apparent in the early school years in most individuals (Criterion C).
However, in others, the learning difficulties may not manifest fully
until later school years, by which time learning demands have increased
and exceed the individual's limited capacities.

Another key diagnostic feature is that the learning difficulties are
considered "specific," for four reasons. First, they are not
attributable to intellectual disabilities (intellectual disability
\[intellectual developmental disorder\]); global developmental delay;
hearing or vision disorders, or neurological or motor disorders)
(Criterion D). Specific learning disorder affects learning in
individuals who otherwise demonstrate normal levels of intellectual
functioning (generally estimated by an IQ score of greater than about 70

\[±5 points allowing for measurement error\]). The phrase "unexpected
academic underachievement" is often cited as the defining characteristic
of specific learning disorder in that the specific learning disabilities
are not part of a more general learning difficulty as manifested in
intellectual disability or global developmental delay. Specific learning
disorder may also occur in individuals identified as intellectually
"gifted." These individuals may be able to sustain apparently adequate
academic functioning by using compensatory strategies, extraordinarily
high effort, or support, until the learning demands or assessment
procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barriers to their demonstrating
their learning or accomplishing required tasks. Second, the learning
difficulty cannot be attributed to more general external factors, such
as economic or environmental disadvantage, chronic absenteeism, or lack
of education as typically provided in the individual's community
context.

Third, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to a neurological
(e.g., pediatric stroke) or motor disorders or to vision or hearing
disorders, which are often associated with problems learning academic
skills but are distinguishable by presence of neurological signs.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p115}**70**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Finally, the learning difficulty may be restricted to one academic skill
or domain (e.g., reading single words, retrieving or calculating number
facts).

Comprehensive assessment is required. Specific learning disorder can
only be diagnosed after formal education starts but can be diagnosed at
any point afterward in children, adolescents, or adults, providing there
is evidence of onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e., the
developmental period). No single data source is sufficient for a
diagnosis of specific learning disorder. Rather, specific learning
disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a synthesis of the
individual's medical, developmental, educational, and family history;
the history of the learning difficulty, including its previous and
current manifestation; the impact of the difficulty on academic,
occupational, or social functioning; previous or current school reports;
portfolios of work requiring academic skills; curriculum-based
assessments; and previous or current scores from individual standardized
tests of academic achievement. If an intellectual, sensory,
neurological, or motor disorder is suspected, then the clinical
assessment for specific learning disorder should also include methods
appropriate for these disorders. Thus, comprehensive assessment will
involve professionals with expertise in specific learning disorder and
psychological/cognitive assessment. Since specific learning disorder
typically persists into adulthood, reassessment is rarely necessary,
unless indicated by marked changes in the learning difficulties
(amelioration or worsening) or requested for specific purposes.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Specific learning disorder is frequently but not invariably preceded, in
preschool years, by delays in attention, language, or motor skills that
may persist and co-occur with specific learning disorder. An uneven
profile of abilities is common, such as above-average abilities in
drawing, design, and other visuospatial abilities, but slow, effortful,
and inaccurate reading and poor reading comprehension and written
expression. Individuals with specific learning disorder typically (but
not invariably) exhibit poor performance on psychological tests of
cognitive processing. However, it remains unclear whether these
cognitive abnormalities are the cause, correlate, or consequence of the
learning difficulties. Also, although cognitive deficits associated with
difficulties learning to read words are well documented, those
associated with other manifestations of specific learning disorder
(e.g., reading comprehension, arithmetic computation, written
expression) are underspecified or unknown. Moreover, individuals with
similar behavioral symptoms or test scores are found to have a variety
of cognitive deficits, and many of these processing deficits are also
found in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g.,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \[ADHD\], autistic spectrum
disorder, communication disorders, developmental coordination disorder).
Thus, assessment of cognitive processing deficits is not required for
diagnostic assessment. Specific learning disorder is associated with
increased risk for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in children,
adolescents, and adults.

There are no known biological markers of specific learning disorder. As
a group, individuals with the disorder show circumscribed alterations in
cognitive processing and brain structure and function. Genetic
differences are also evident at the group level. But cognitive testing,
neuroimaging, or genetic testing are not useful for diagnosis at this
time.

Prevalence

The prevalence of specific learning disorder across the academic domains
of reading, writing, and mathematics is 5%--15% among school-age
children across different languages and cultures. Prevalence in adults
is unknown but appears to be approximately 4%.

Development and Course

Onset, recognition, and diagnosis of specific learning disorder usually
occurs during the elementary school years when children are required to
learn to read, spell, write, and learn

[]{#index_split_012.html#p116}Specific Learning Disorder

**71**

mathematics. However, precursors such as language delays or deficits,
difficulties in rhyming or counting, or difficulties with fine motor
skills required for writing commonly occur in early childhood before the
start of formal schooling. Manifestations may be behavioral (e.g., a
reluctance to engage in learning; oppositional behavior). Specific
learning disorder is lifelong, but the course and clinical expression
are variable, in part depending on the interactions among the task
demands of the environment, the range and severity of the individual's
learning difficulties, the individual's learning abilities, comorbidity,
and the available support systems and intervention. Nonetheless,
problems with reading fluency and comprehension, spelling, written
expression, and numeracy skills in everyday life typically persist into
adulthood.

Changes in manifestation of symptoms occur with age, so that an
individual may have a persistent or shifting array of learning
difficulties across the lifespan.

Examples of symptoms that may be observed among preschool-age children
include a lack of interest in playing games with language sounds (e.g.,
repetition, rhyming), and they may have trouble learning nursery rhymes.
Preschool children with specific learning disorder may frequently use
baby talk, mispronounce words, and have trouble remembering names of
letters, numbers, or days of the week. They may fail to recognize
letters in their own names and have trouble learning to count.
Kindergarten-age children with specific learning disorder may be unable
to recognize and write letters, may be unable to write their own names,
or may use invented spelling. They may have trouble breaking down spoken
words into syllables (e.g., "cowboy" into "cow" and "boy") and trouble
recognizing words that rhyme (e.g., cat, bat, hat).

Kindergarten-age children also may have trouble connecting letters with
their sounds (e.g., letter b makes the sound *b*) and may be unable to
recognize phonemes (e.g., do not know which in a set of words \[e.g.,
dog, man, car\] starts with the same sound as "cat").

Specific learning disorder in elementary school--age children typically
manifests as marked difficulty learning letter-sound correspondence
(particularly in English-speaking children), fluent word decoding,
spelling, or math facts; reading aloud is slow, inaccurate, and
effortful, and some children struggle to understand the magnitude that a
spoken or written number represents. Children in primary grades (grades
1--3) may continue to have problems recognizing and manipulating
phonemes, be unable to read common one-syllable words (such as mat or
top), and be unable recognize common irregularly spelled words (e.g.,
said, two). They may commit reading errors that indicate problems in
connecting sounds and letters (e.g., "big" for "got") and have
difficulty sequencing numbers and letters. Children in grades 1-3 also
may have difficulty remembering number facts or arithmetic procedures
for adding, subtracting, and so forth, and may complain that reading or
arithmetic is hard and avoid doing it. Children with specific learning
disorder in the middle grades (grades 4--6) may mispronounce or skip
parts of long, multisyllable words (e.g., say "conible" for
"convertible," "aminal" for "animal") and confuse words that sound alike
(e.g., "tornado" for "volcano"). They may have trouble remembering
dates, names, and telephone numbers and may have trouble completing
homework or tests on time. Children in the middle grades also may have
poor comprehension with or without slow, effortful, and inaccurate
reading, and they may have trouble reading small function words (e.g.,
that, the, an, in). They may have very poor spelling and poor written
work.

They may get the first part of a word correctly, then guess wildly
(e.g., read "clover" as

"clock"), and may express fear of reading aloud or refuse to read aloud.

By contrast, adolescents may have mastered word decoding, but reading
remains slow and effortful, and they are likely to show marked problems
in reading comprehension and written expression (including poor
spelling) and poor mastery of math facts or mathematical problem
solving. During adolescence and into adulthood, individuals with
specific learning disorder may continue to make numerous spelling
mistakes and read single words and connected text slowly and with much
effort, with trouble pronouncing multisyllable words. They may
frequently need to reread material to understand or get the main point
and have trouble making inferences from written text. Adolescents and
adults may []{#index_split_012.html#p117}**72**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

avoid activities that demand reading or arithmetic (reading for
pleasure, reading instructions). Adults with specific learning disorder
have ongoing spelling problems, slow and effortful reading, or problems
making important inferences from numerical information in work-related
written documents. They may avoid both leisure and work-related
activities that demand reading or writing or use alternative approaches
to access print (e.g., text-to-speech/speech-to-text software,
audiobooks, audiovisual media).

An alternative clinical expression is that of circumscribed learning
difficulties that persist across the lifespan, such as an inability to
master the basic sense of number (e.g., to know which of a pair of
numbers or dots represents the larger magnitude), or lack of proficiency
in word identification or spelling. Avoidance of or reluctance to engage
in activities requiring academic skills is common in children,
adolescents, and adults. Episodes of severe anxiety or anxiety
disorders, including somatic complaints or panic attacks, are common
across the lifespan and accompany both the circumscribed and the broader
expression of learning difficulties.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Prematurity or very low birth weight increases the risk for specific
learning disorder, as does prenatal exposure to nicotine.

Genetic and physiological.

Specific learning disorder appears to aggregate in families,
particularly when affecting reading, mathematics, and spelling. The
relative risk of specific learning disorder in reading or mathematics is
substantially higher (e.g., 4--8 times and 5--10 times higher,
respectively) in first-degree relatives of individuals with these
learning difficulties compared with those without them. Family history
of reading difficulties (dyslexia) and parental literacy skills predict
literacy problems or specific learning disorder in offspring, indicating
the combined role of genetic and environmental factors.

There is high heritability for both reading ability and reading
disability in alphabetic and nonalphabetic languages, including high
heritability for most manifestations of learning abilities and
disabilities (e.g., heritability estimate values greater than 0.6).
Covariation between various manifestations of learning difficulties is
high, suggesting that genes related to one presentation are highly
correlated with genes related to another manifestation.

Course modifiers.

Marked problems with inattentive behavior in preschool years is
predictive of later difficulties in reading and mathematics (but not
necessarily specific learning disorder) and nonresponse to effective
academic interventions. Delay or disorders in speech or language, or
impaired cognitive processing (e.g., phonological awareness, working
memory, rapid serial naming) in preschool years, predicts later specific
learning disorder in reading and written expression. Comorbidity with
ADHD is predictive of worse mental health outcome than that associated
with specific learning disorder without ADHD. Systematic, intensive,
individualized instruction, using evidence-based interventions, may
improve or ameliorate the learning difficulties in some individuals or
promote the use of compensatory strategies in others, thereby mitigating
the otherwise poor outcomes.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Specific learning disorder occurs across languages, cultures, races, and
socioeconomic conditions but may vary in its manifestation according to
the nature of the spoken and written symbol systems and cultural and
educational practices. For example, the cognitive processing
requirements of reading and of working with numbers vary greatly across
or-thographies. In the English language, the observable hallmark
clinical symptom of difficulties learning to read is inaccurate and slow
reading of single words; in other alphabetic languages that have more
direct mapping between sounds and letters (e.g., Spanish, German) and in
nonalphabetic languages (e.g., Chinese, Japanese), the hallmark feature
is []{#index_split_012.html#p118}Specific Learning Disorder

**73**

slow but accurate reading. In English-language learners, assessment
should include consideration of whether the source of reading
difficulties is a limited proficiency with English or a specific
learning disorder. Risk factors for specific learning disorder in
English-language learners include a family history of specific learning
disorder or language delay in the native language, as well as learning
difficulties in English and failure to catch up with peers. If there is
suspicion of cultural or language differences (e.g., as in an
English-language learner), the assessment needs to take into account the
individual's language proficiency in his or her first or native language
as well as in the second language (in this example, English). Also,
assessment should consider the linguistic and cultural context in which
the individual is living, as well as his or her educational and learning
history in the original culture and language.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Specific learning disorder is more common in males than in females
(ratios range from about 2:1 to 3:1) and cannot be attributed to factors
such as ascertainment bias, definitional or measurement variation,
language, race, or socioeconomic status.

Functional Consequences of

Specific Learning Disorder

Specific learning disorder can have negative functional consequences
across the lifespan, including lower academic attainment, higher rates
of high school dropout, lower rates of postsecondary education, high
levels of psychological distress and poorer overall mental health,
higher rates of unemployment and under-employment, and lower incomes.
School dropout and co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk
for poor mental health outcomes, including suicidality, whereas high
levels of social or emotional support predict better mental health
outcomes.

Differential Diagnosis

Normal variations in academic attainment.

Specific learning disorder is distinguished

from normal variations in academic attainment due to external factors
(e.g., lack of educational opportunity, consistently poor instruction,
learning in a second language), because the learning difficulties
persist in the presence of adequate educational opportunity and exposure
to the same instruction as the peer group, and competency in the
language of instruction, even when it is different from one's primary
spoken language.

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).

Specific learning disorder

differs from general learning difficulties associated with intellectual
disability, because the learning difficulties occur in the presence of
normal levels of intellectual functioning (i.e., IQ score of at least 70
± 5). If intellectual disability is present, specific learning disorder
can be diagnosed only when the learning difficulties are in excess of
those usually associated with the intellectual disability.

Learning difficulties due to neurological or sensory disorders.

Specific learning disorder is distinguished from learning difficulties
due to neurological or sensory disorders (e.g., pediatric stroke,
traumatic brain injury, hearing impairment, vision impairment), because
in these cases there are abnormal findings on neurological examination.

Neurocognitive disorders.

Specific learning disorder is distinguished from learning problems
associated with neurodegenerative cognitive disorders, because in
specific learning disorder the clinical expression of specific learning
difficulties occurs during the developmental period, and the
difficulties do not manifest as a marked decline from a former state.

[]{#index_split_012.html#p119}**74**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Specific learning disorder is distinguished from

the poor academic performance associated with ADHD, because in the
latter condition the problems may not necessarily reflect specific
difficulties in learning academic skills but rather may reflect
difficulties in performing those skills. However, the co-occurrence of
specific learning disorder and ADHD is more frequent than expected by
chance. If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be
given.

Psychotic disorders.

Specific learning disorder is distinguished from the academic and
cognitive-processing difficulties associated with schizophrenia or
psychosis, because with these disorders there is a decline (often rapid)
in these functional domains.

Comorbidity

Specific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with neurodevelopmental
(e.g., ADHD, communication disorders, developmental coordination
disorder, autistic spectrum disorder) or other mental disorders (e.g.,
anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders).

These comorbidities do not necessarily exclude the diagnosis specific
learning disorder but may make testing and differential diagnosis more
difficult, because each of the co-occurring disorders independently
interferes with the execution of activities of daily living, including
learning. Thus, clinical judgment is required to attribute such
impairment to learning difficulties. If there is an indication that
another diagnosis could account for the difficulties learning keystone
academic skills described in Criterion A, specific learning disorder
should not be diagnosed.

**Motor Disorders**

[]{#index_split_013.html}

Developmental Coordination Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**315.4 (F82)**

A. The acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills is
substantially below that expected given the individual's chronological
age and opportunity for skill learning and use. Difficulties are
manifested as clumsiness (e.g., dropping or bumping into objects) as
well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor skills (e.g.,
catching an object, using scissors or cutlery, handwriting, riding a
bike, or participating in sports).

B. The motor skills deficit in Criterion A significantly and
persistently interferes with activities of daily living appropriate to
chronological age (e.g., self-care and self-maintenance) and impacts
academic/school productivity, prevocational and vocational activities,
leisure, and play.

C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.

D. The motor skills deficits are not better explained by intellectual
disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or visual impairment
and are not attributable to a neurological condition affecting movement
(e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, degenerative disorder).

Diagnostic Features

The diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder is made by a
clinical synthesis of the history (developmental and medical), physical
examination, school or workplace report, and individual assessment using
psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate standardized tests.
The manifestation of impaired skills requiring motor coordination
(Criterion A) varies

[]{#index_split_013.html#p120}Developmental Coordination Disorder

**75**

with age. Young children may be delayed in achieving motor milestones
(i.e., sitting, crawling, walking), although many achieve typical motor
milestones. They also may be delayed in developing skills such as
negotiating stairs, pedaling, buttoning shirts, completing puzzles, and
using zippers. Even when the skill is achieved, movement execution may
appear awkward, slow, or less precise than that of peers. Older children
and adults may display slow speed or inaccuracy with motor aspects of
activities such as assembling puzzles, building models, playing ball
games (especially in teams), handwriting, typing, driving, or carrying
out self-care skills.

Developmental coordination disorder is diagnosed only if the impairment
in motor skills significantly interferes with the performance of, or
participation in, daily activities in family, social, school, or
community life (Criterion B). Examples of such activities include
getting dressed, eating meals with age-appropriate utensils and without
mess, engaging in physical games with others, using specific tools in
class such as rulers and scissors, and participating in team exercise
activities at school. Not only is ability to perform these actions
impaired, but also marked slowness in execution is common. Handwriting
competence is frequently affected, consequently affecting legibility
and/or speed of written output and affecting academic achievement (the
impact is distinguished from specific learning difficulty by the
emphasis on the motoric component of written output skills). In adults,
everyday skills in education and work, especially those in which speed
and accuracy are required, are affected by coordination problems.

Criterion C states that the onset of symptoms of developmental
coordination disorder must be in the early developmental period.
However, developmental coordination disorder is typically not diagnosed
before age 5 years because there is considerable variation in the age at
acquisition of many motor skills or a lack of stability of measurement
in early childhood (e.g., some children catch up) or because other
causes of motor delay may not have fully manifested.

Criterion D specifies that the diagnosis of developmental coordination
disorder is made if the coordination difficulties are not better
explained by visual impairment or attributable to a neurological
condition. Thus, visual function examination and neurological
examination must be included in the diagnostic evaluation. If
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is
present, the motor difficulties are in excess of those expected for the
mental age; however, no IQ cut-off or discrepancy criterion is
specified.

Developmental coordination disorder does not have discrete subtypes;
however, individuals may be impaired predominantly in gross motor skills
or in fine motor skills, including handwriting skills.

Other terms used to describe developmental coordination disorder include
*childhood* *dyspraxia,* *specific developmental disorder of motor
function,* and *clumsy child syndrome.*

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Some children with developmental coordination disorder show additional
(usually suppressed) motor activity, such as choreiform movements of
unsupported limbs or mirror movements. These "overflow" movements are
referred to as *neurodevelopmental immaturities* or *neurological soft
signs* rather than neurological abnormalities. In both current
literature and clinical practice, their role in diagnosis is still
unclear, requiring further evaluation.

Prevalence

The prevalence of developmental coordination disorder in children ages
5--11 years is 5%--

6% (in children age 7 years, 1.8% are diagnosed with severe
developmental coordination disorder and 3% with probable developmental
coordination disorder). Males are more often affected than females, with
a male:female ratio between 2:1 and 7:1.

Development and Course

The course of developmental coordination disorder is variable but stable
at least to 1 year follow-up. Although there may be improvement in the
longer term, problems with coor-

[]{#index_split_013.html#p121}**76**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

dinated movements continue through adolescence in an estimated 50%--70%
of children.

Onset is in early childhood. Delayed motor milestones may be the first
signs, or the disorder is first recognized when the child attempts tasks
such as holding a knife and fork, buttoning clothes, or playing ball
games. In middle childhood, there are difficulties with motor aspects of
assembling puzzles, building models, playing ball, and handwriting, as
well as with organizing belongings, when motor sequencing and
coordination are required. In early adulthood, there is continuing
difficulty in learning new tasks involving complex/automatic motor
skills, including driving and using tools. Inability to take notes and
handwrite quickly may affect performance in the workplace. Co-occurrence
with other disorders (see the section "Comorbidity" for this disorder)
has an additional impact on presentation, course, and outcome.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Developmental coordination disorder is more common following prenatal
exposure to alcohol and in preterm and low-birth-weight children.

Genetic and physiological.

Impairments in underlying neurodevelopmental processes---

particularly in visual-motor skills, both in visual-motor perception and
spatial mentalizing---

have been found and affect the ability to make rapid motoric adjustments
as the complexity of the required movements increases. Cerebellar
dysfunction has been proposed, but the neural basis of developmental
coordination disorder remains unclear. Because of the co-occurrence of
developmental coordination disorder with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), specific learning disabilities, and autism spectrum
disorder, shared genetic effect has been proposed. However, consistent
co-occurrence in twins appears only in severe cases.

Course modifiers.

Individuals with ADHD and with developmental coordination disorder
demonstrate more impairment than individuals with ADHD without
developmental coordination disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Developmental coordination disorder occurs across cultures, races, and
socioeconomic conditions. By definition, "activities of daily living"
implies cultural differences necessitating consideration of the context
in which the individual child is living as well as whether he or she has
had appropriate opportunities to learn and practice such activities.

Functional Consequences of

Developmental Coordination Disorder

Developmental coordination disorder leads to impaired functional
performance in activities of daily living (Criterion B), and the
impairment is increased with co-occurring conditions. Consequences of
developmental coordination disorder include reduced participation in
team play and sports; poor self-esteem and sense of self-worth;
emotional or behavior problems; impaired academic achievement; poor
physical fitness; and reduced physical activity and obesity.

Differential Diagnosis

Motor impairments due to another medical condition.

Problems in coordination may

be associated with visual function impairment and specific neurological
disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy, progressive lesions of the cerebellum,
neuromuscular disorders). In such cases, there are additional findings
on neurological examination.

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).

If intellectual disability is

present, motor competences may be impaired in accordance with the
intellectual disabil-

[]{#index_split_013.html#p122}Stereotypic Movement Disorder

**77**

ity. However, if the motor difficulties are in excess of what could be
accounted for by the intellectual disability, and criteria for
developmental coordination disorder are met, developmental coordination
disorder can be diagnosed as well.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Individuals with ADHD may fall, bump into

objects, or knock things over. Careful observation across different
contexts is required to ascertain if lack of motor competence is
attributable to distractibility and impulsiveness rather than to
developmental coordination disorder. If criteria for both ADHD and
developmental coordination disorder are met, both diagnoses can be
given.

Autism spectrum disorder.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may be uninterested in
participating in tasks requiring complex coordination skills, such as
ball sports, which will affect test performance and function but not
reflect core motor competence. Co-occurrence of developmental
coordination disorder and autism spectrum disorder is common. If
criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.

Joint hypermobility syndrome.

Individuals with syndromes causing hyperextensible

joints (found on physical examination; often with a complaint of pain)
may present with symptoms similar to those of developmental coordination
disorder.

Comorbidity

Disorders that commonly co-occur with developmental coordination
disorder include speech and language disorder; specific learning
disorder (especially reading and writing); problems of inattention,
including ADHD (the most frequent coexisting condition, with about 50%
co-occurrence); autism spectrum disorder; disruptive and emotional
behavior problems; and joint hypermobility syndrome. Different clusters
of co-occurrence may be present (e.g., a cluster with severe reading
disorders, fine motor problems, and handwriting problems; another
cluster with impaired movement control and motor planning). Presence of
other disorders does not exclude developmental coordination disorder but
may make testing more difficult and may independently interfere with the
execution of activities of daily living, thus requiring examiner
judgment in ascribing impairment to motor skills.

Stereotypic Movement Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**307.3 (F98.4)**

A. Repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor
behavior (e.g., hand shaking or waving, body rocking, head banging,
self-biting, hitting own body).

B. The repetitive motor behavior interferes with social, academic, or
other activities and may result in self-injury.

C. Onset is in the early developmental period.

D. The repetitive motor behavior is not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance or neurological condition and is
not better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder
(e.g., trichotillomania \[hair-pulling disorder\], obsessive-compulsive
disorder).

*Specify* if:

**With self-injurious behavior** (or behavior that would result in an
injury if preventive measures were not used)

**Without self-injurious behavior**

*Specify* if:

**Associated with a known medical or genetic condition,
neurodevelopmental disorder, or environmental factor** (e.g.,
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, intellectual disability

\[intellectual developmental disorder\], intrauterine alcohol exposure)

[]{#index_split_013.html#p123}**78**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

**Coding note:** Use additional code to identify the associated medical
or genetic condition, or neurodevelopmental disorder.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Symptoms are easily suppressed by sensory stimulus or
distraction.

**Moderate:** Symptoms require explicit protective measures and
behavioral modification.

**Severe:** Continuous monitoring and protective measures are required
to prevent serious injury.

Recording Procedures

For stereotypic movement disorder that is associated with a known
medical or genetic condition, neurodevelopmental disorder, or
environmental factor, record stereotypic movement disorder associated
with (name of condition, disorder, or factor) (e.g., stereotypic
movement disorder associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome).

Specifiers

The severity of non-self-injurious stereotypic movements ranges from
mild presentations that are easily suppressed by a sensory stimulus or
distraction to continuous movements that markedly interfere with all
activities of daily living. Self-injurious behaviors range in severity
along various dimensions, including the frequency, impact on adaptive
functioning, and severity of bodily injury (from mild bruising or
erythema from hitting hand against body, to lacerations or amputation of
digits, to retinal detachment from head banging).

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of stereotypic movement disorder is repetitive,
seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor behavior (Criterion
A). These behaviors are often rhythmical movements of the head, hands,
or body without obvious adaptive function.

The movements may or may not respond to efforts to stop them. Among
typically developing children, the repetitive movements may be stopped
when attention is directed to them or when the child is distracted from
performing them. Among children with neurodevelopmental disorders, the
behaviors are typically less responsive to such efforts. In other cases,
the individual demonstrates self-restraining behaviors (e.g., sitting on
hands, wrapping arms in clothing, finding a protective device).

The repertoire of behaviors is variable; each individual presents with
his or her own individually patterned, "signature" behavior. Examples of
non-self-injurious stereotypic movements include, but are not limited
to, body rocking, bilateral flapping or rotating hand movements,
flicking or fluttering fingers in front of the face, arm waving or
flapping, and head nodding. Stereotyped self-injurious behaviors
include, but are not limited to, repetitive head banging, face slapping,
eye poking, and biting of hands, lips, or other body parts. Eye poking
is particularly concerning; it occurs more frequently among children
with visual impairment. Multiple movements may be combined (e.g.,
cocking the head, rocking the torso, waving a small string repetitively
in front of the face).

Stereotypic movements may occur many times during a day, lasting a few
seconds to several minutes or longer. Frequency can vary from many
occurrences in a single day to several weeks elapsing between episodes.
The behaviors vary in context, occurring when the individual is
engrossed in other activities, when excited, stressed, fatigued, or
bored.

Criterion A requires that the movements be "apparently" purposeless.
However, some functions may be served by the movements. For example,
stereotypic movements might reduce anxiety in response to external
stressors.

Criterion B states that the stereotypic movements interfere with social,
academic, or other activities and, in some children, may result in
self-injury (or would if protective measures were not used). If
self-injury is present, it should be coded using the specifier. Onset

of stereotypic movements is in the early developmental period (Criterion
C). Criterion D

states that the repetitive, stereotyped behavior in stereotypic movement
disorder is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance
or neurological condition and is not better explained by another
neurodevelopmental or mental disorder. The presence of stereotypic
movements may indicate an undetected neurodevelopmental problem,
especially in children ages 1--3 years.

Prevalence

Simple stereotypic movements (e.g., rocking) are common in young
typically developing children. Complex stereotypic movements are much
less common (occurring in approximately 3%--4%). Between 4% and 16% of
individuals with intellectual disability (intellectual developmental
disorder) engage in stereotypy and self-injury. The risk is greater in
individuals with severe intellectual disability. Among individuals with
intellectual disability living in residential facilities, 10%--15% may
have stereotypic movement disorder with self-injury.

Development and Course

Stereotypic movements typically begin within the first 3 years of life.
Simple stereotypic movements are common in infancy and may be involved
in acquisition of motor mastery. In children who develop complex motor
stereotypies, approximately 80% exhibit symptoms before 24 months of
age, 12% between 24 and 35 months, and 8% at 36 months or older. In most
typically developing children, these movements resolve over time or can
be suppressed. Onset of complex motor stereotypies may be in infancy or
later in the developmental period. Among individuals with intellectual
disability, the stereotyped, self-injurious behaviors may persist for
years, even though the typography or pattern of self-injury may change.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Social isolation is a risk factor for self-stimulation that may progress
to stereotypic movements with repetitive self-injury. Environmental
stress may also trigger stereotypic behavior. Fear may alter
physiological state, resulting in increased frequency of stereotypic
behaviors.

Genetic and physiological.

Lower cognitive functioning is linked to greater risk for stereotypic
behaviors and poorer response to interventions. Stereotypic movements
are more frequent among individuals with moderate-to-severe/profound
intellectual disability, who by virtue of a particular syndrome (e.g.,
Rett syndrome) or environmental factor (e.g., an environment with
relatively insufficient stimulation) seem to be at higher risk for
stereotypies. Repetitive self-injurious behavior may be a behavioral
phenotype in neurogenetic syndromes. For example, in Lesch-Nyhan
syndrome, there are both stereotypic dystonic movements and
self-mutilation of fingers, lip biting, and other forms of self-injury
unless the individual is restrained, and in Rett syndrome and Cornelia
de Lange syndrome, self-injury may result from the hand-to-mouth
stereotypies. Stereotypic behaviors may result from a painful medical
condition (e.g., middle ear infection, dental problems, gastroesophageal
reflux).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Stereotypic movement disorder, with or without self-injury, occurs in
all races and cultures.

Cultural attitudes toward unusual behaviors may result in delayed
diagnosis. Overall cultural tolerance and attitudes toward stereotypic
movement vary and must be considered.

Differential Diagnosis

Normal development.

Simple stereotypic movements are common in infancy and early childhood.
Rocking may occur in the transition from sleep to awake, a behavior that
usu-

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

ally resolves with age. Complex stereotypies are less common in
typically developing children and can usually be suppressed by
distraction or sensory stimulation. The individual's daily routine is
rarely affected, and the movements generally do not cause the child
distress. The diagnosis would not be appropriate in these circumstances.

Autism spectrum disorder.

Stereotypic movements may be a presenting symptom of

autism spectrum disorder and should be considered when repetitive
movements and behaviors are being evaluated. Deficits of social
communication and reciprocity manifesting in autism spectrum disorder
are generally absent in stereotypic movement disorder, and thus social
interaction, social communication, and rigid repetitive behaviors and
interests are distinguishing features. When autism spectrum disorder is
present, stereotypic movement disorder is diagnosed only when there is
self-injury or when the stereotypic behaviors are sufficiently severe to
become a focus of treatment.

Tic disorders.

Typically, stereotypies have an earlier age at onset (before 3 years)
than do tics, which have a mean age at onset of 5--7 years. They are
consistent and fixed in their pattern or topography compared with tics,
which are variable in their presentation. Stereotypies may involve arms,
hands, or the entire body, while tics commonly involve eyes, face, head,
and shoulders. Stereotypies are more fixed, rhythmic, and prolonged in
duration than tics, which, generally, are brief, rapid, random, and
fluctuating. Tics and stereotypic movements are both reduced by
distraction.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

Stereotypic movement disorder is distinguished from obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) by the absence of obsessions, as well as by the nature of
the repetitive behaviors. In OCD the individual feels driven to perform
repetitive behaviors in response to an obsession or according to rules
that must be applied rigidly, whereas in stereotypic movement disorder
the behaviors are seemingly driven but apparently purposeless.
Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking)
disorder are characterized by body-focused repetitive behaviors (i.e.,
hair pulling and skin picking) that may be seemingly driven but that are
not apparently purposeless, and that may not be patterned or rhythmical.
Furthermore, onset in trichotillomania and excoriation disorder is not
typically in the early developmental period, but rather around puberty
or later.

Other neurological and medical conditions.

The diagnosis of stereotypic movements

requires the exclusion of habits, mannerisms, paroxysmal dyskinesias,
and benign hereditary chorea. A neurological history and examination are
required to assess features suggestive of other disorders, such as
myoclonus, dystonia, tics, and chorea. Involuntary movements associated
with a neurological condition may be distinguished by their signs and
symptoms. For example, repetitive, stereotypic movements in tardive
dyskinesia can be distinguished by a history of chronic neuroleptic use
and characteristic oral or facial dyskinesia or irregular trunk or limb
movements. These types of movements do not result in self-injury. A
diagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder is not appropriate for
repetitive skin picking or scratching associated with amphetamine
intoxication or abuse (e.g., patients are diagnosed with
substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder)
and repetitive choreoathetoid movements associated with other
neurological disorders.

Comorbidity

Stereotypic movement disorder may occur as a primary diagnosis or
secondary to another disorder. For example, stereotypies are a common
manifestation of a variety of neurogenetic disorders, such as
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Cornelia de
Lange syndrome, and Smith-Magenis syndrome. When stereotypic movement
disorder co-occurs with another medical condition, both should be coded.

Specifiers

The "motor tics only" or "vocal tics only" specifier is only required
for persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder.

Diagnostic Features

Tic disorders comprise four diagnostic categories: Tourette's disorder,
persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, provisional tic
disorder, and the other specified and unspecified tic disorders.
Diagnosis for any tic disorder is based on the presence of motor and/or
vocal tics (Criterion A), duration of tic symptoms (Criterion B), age at
onset (Criterion C), and absence of any known cause such as another
medical condition or substance use (Criterion D).

The tic disorders are hierarchical in order (i.e., Tourette's disorder,
followed by persistent

\[chronic\] motor or vocal tic disorder, followed by provisional tic
disorder, followed by the

[]{#index_split_013.html#p127}**82**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

other specified and unspecified tic disorders), such that once a tic
disorder at one level of the hierarchy is diagnosed, a lower hierarchy
diagnosis cannot be made (Criterion E).

Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or
vocalizations. An individual may have various tic symptoms over time,
but at any point in time, the tic repertoire recurs in a characteristic
fashion. Although tics can include almost any muscle group or
vocalization, certain tic symptoms, such as eye blinking or throat
clearing, are common across patient populations. Tics are generally
experienced as involuntary but can be voluntarily suppressed for varying
lengths of time.

Tics can be either simple or complex. *Simple motor tics* are of short
duration (i.e., milli-seconds) and can include eye blinking, shoulder
shrugging, and extension of the extremities. Simple vocal tics include
throat clearing, sniffing, and grunting often caused by contraction of
the diaphragm or muscles of the oropharynx. *Complex motor tics* are of
longer duration (i.e., seconds) and often include a combination of
simple tics such as simultaneous head turning and shoulder shrugging.
Complex tics can appear purposeful, such as a tic-like sexual or obscene
gesture ( *copropraxia*) or a tic-like imitation of someone else's
movements ( *echopraxia*). Similarly, complex vocal tics include
repeating one's own sounds or words ( *palilalia*), repeating the
last-heard word or phrase ( *echolalia*), or uttering socially
unacceptable words, including obscenities, or ethnic, racial, or
religious slurs ( *coprolalia*).

Importantly, coprolalia is an abrupt, sharp bark or grunt utterance and
lacks the prosody of similar inappropriate speech observed in human
interactions.

The presence of motor and/or vocal tics varies across the four tic
disorders (Criterion A). For Tourette's disorder, both motor and vocal
tics must be present, whereas for persistent (chronic) motor or vocal
tic disorder, only motor or only vocal tics are present. For provisional
tic disorder, motor and/or vocal tics may be present. For other
specified or unspecified tic disorders, the movement disorder symptoms
are best characterized as tics but are atypical in presentation or age
at onset, or have a known etiology.

The 1-year minimum duration criterion (Criterion B) assures that
individuals diagnosed with either Tourette's disorder or persistent
(chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder have had persistent symptoms. Tics
wax and wane in severity, and some individuals may have tic-free periods
of weeks to months; however, an individual who has had tic symptoms of
greater than 1 year's duration since first tic onset would be considered
to have persistent symptoms regardless of duration of tic-free periods.
For an individual with motor and/or vocal tics of less than 1 year since
first tic onset, a provisional tic disorder diagnosis can be considered.
There is no duration specification for other specified and unspecified
tic disorders. The onset of tics must occur prior to age 18 years
(Criterion C). Tic disorders typically begin in the prepubertal period,
with an average age at onset between 4 and 6

years, and with the incidence of new-onset tic disorders decreasing in
the teen years. New onset of tic symptoms in adulthood is exceedingly
rare and is often associated with exposures to drugs (e.g., excessive
cocaine use) or is a result of a central nervous system insult (e.g.,
postviral encephalitis). Although tic onset is uncommon in teenagers and
adults, it is not uncommon for adolescents and adults to present for an
initial diagnostic assessment and, when carefully evaluated, provide a
history of milder symptoms dating back to childhood. New-onset abnormal
movements suggestive of tics outside of the usual age range should
result in evaluation for other movement disorders or for specific
etiologies.

Tic symptoms cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or another medical condition (Criterion D). When there is
strong evidence from the history, physical examination, and/or
laboratory results to suggest a plausible, proximal, and probable cause
for a tic disorder, a diagnosis of other specified tic disorder should
be used.

Having previously met diagnostic criteria for Tourette's disorder
negates a possible diagnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic
disorder (Criterion E). Similarly, a previous diagnosis of persistent
(chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder negates a diagnosis of provisional
tic disorder or other specified or unspecified tic disorder (Criterion
E).

[]{#index_split_013.html#p128}Tic Disorders

**83**

Prevalence

Tics are common in childhood but transient in most cases. The estimated
prevalence of Tourette's disorder ranges from 3 to 8 per 1,000 in
school-age children. Males are more commonly affected than females, with
the ratio varying from 2:1 to 4:1. A national survey in the United
States estimated 3 per 1,000 for the prevalence of clinically identified
cases.

The frequency of identified cases was lower among African Americans and
Hispanic Americans, which may be related to differences in access to
care.

Development and Course

Onset of tics is typically between ages 4 and 6 years. Peak severity
occurs between ages 10

and 12 years, with a decline in severity during adolescence. Many adults
with tic disorders experience diminished symptoms. A small percentage of
individuals will have persistently severe or worsening symptoms in
adulthood.

Tic symptoms manifest similarly in all age groups and across the
lifespan. Tics wax and wane in severity and change in affected muscle
groups and vocalizations over time. As children get older, they begin to
report their tics being associated with a premonitory urge---a somatic
sensation that precedes the tic---and a feeling of tension reduction
following the expression of the tic. Tics associated with a premonitory
urge may be experienced as not completely "involuntary" in that the urge
and the tic can be resisted. An individual may also feel the need to
perform a tic in a specific way or repeat it until he or she achieves
the feeling that the tic has been done "just right."

The vulnerability toward developing co-occurring conditions changes as
individuals pass through the age of risk for various co-occurring
conditions. For example, prepubertal children with tic disorders are
more likely to experience attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and separation anxiety
disorder than are teenagers and adults, who are more likely to
experience the new onset of major depressive disorder, substance use
disorder, or bipolar disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Tics are worsened by anxiety, excitement, and exhaustion and are better
during calm, focused activities. Individuals may have fewer tics when
engaged in schoolwork or tasks at work than when relaxing at home after
school or in the evening. Stressful/exciting events (e.g., taking a
test, participating in exciting activities) often make tics worse.

Environmental.

Observing a gesture or sound in another person may result in an
individual with a tic disorder making a similar gesture or sound, which
may be incorrectly perceived by others as purposeful. This can be a
particular problem when the individual is interacting with authority
figures (e.g., teachers, supervisors, police).

Genetic and physiological.

Genetic and environmental factors influence tic symptom expression and
severity. Important risk alleles for Tourette's disorder and rare
genetic variants in families with tic disorders have been identified.
Obstetrical complications, older paternal age, lower birth weight, and
maternal smoking during pregnancy are associated with worse tic
severity.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Tic disorders do not appear to vary in clinical characteristics, course,
or etiology by race, ethnicity, and culture. However, race, ethnicity,
and culture may impact how tic disorders are perceived and managed in
the family and community, as well as influencing patterns of help
seeking, and choices of treatment.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p129}**84**

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Males are more commonly affected than females, but there are no gender
differences in the kinds of tics, age at onset, or course. Women with
persistent tic disorders may be more likely to experience anxiety and
depression.

Functional Consequences of Tic Disorders

Many individuals with mild to moderate tic severity experience no
distress or impairment in functioning and may even be unaware of their
tics. Individuals with more severe symptoms generally have more
impairment in daily living, but even individuals with moderate or even
severe tic disorders may function well. The presence of a co-occurring
condition, such as ADHD or OCD, can have greater impact on functioning.
Less commonly, tics disrupt functioning in daily activities and result
in social isolation, interpersonal conflict, peer victimization,
inability to work or to go to school, and lower quality of life. The
individual also may experience substantial psychological distress. Rare
complications of Tourette's disorder include physical injury, such as
eye injury (from hitting oneself in the face), and orthopedic and
neurological injury (e.g., disc disease related to forceful head and
neck movements).

Differential Diagnosis

Abnormal movements that may accompany other medical conditions and
stereotypic movement disorder.

*Motor stereotypies* are defined as involuntary rhythmic, repetitive,
predictable movements that appear purposeful but serve no obvious
adaptive function or purpose and stop with distraction. Examples include
repetitive hand waving/rotating, arm flapping, and finger wiggling.
Motor stereotypies can be differentiated from tics based on the former's
earlier age at onset (younger than 3 years), prolonged duration (seconds
to minutes), constant repetitive fixed form and location, exacerbation
when engrossed in activities, lack of a premonitory urge, and cessation
with distraction (e.g., name called or touched). *Chorea* represents
rapid, random, continual, abrupt, irregular, unpredictable,
nonstereotyped actions that are usually bilateral and affect all parts
of the body (i.e., face, trunk, and limbs). The timing, direction, and
distribution of movements vary from moment to moment, and movements
usually worsen during attempted voluntary action. *Dystonia* is the
simultaneous sustained contracture of both agonist and antagonist
muscles, resulting in a distorted posture or movement of parts of the
body. Dystonic postures are often triggered by attempts at voluntary
movements and are not seen during sleep.

Substance-induced and paroxysmal dyskinesias.

Paroxysmal dyskinesias usually occur as dystonic or choreoathetoid
movements that are precipitated by voluntary movement or exertion and
less commonly arise from normal background activity.

Myoclonus.

Myoclonus is characterized by a sudden unidirectional movement that is
often nonrhythmic. It may be worsened by movement and occur during
sleep. Myoclonus is differentiated from tics by its rapidity, lack of
suppressibility, and absence of a premonitory urge.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

Differentiating obsessive-compulsive

behaviors from tics may be difficult. Clues favoring an
obsessive-compulsive behavior include a cognitive-based drive (e.g.,
fear of contamination) and the need to perform the action in a
particular fashion a certain number of times, equally on both sides of
the body, or until a "just right" feeling is achieved. Impulse-control
problems and other repetitive behaviors, including persistent hair
pulling, skin picking, and nail biting, appear more goal directed and
complex than tics.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p130}Other Specified Tic Disorder

**85**

Comorbidity

Many medical and psychiatric conditions have been described as
co-occurring with tic disorders, with ADHD and obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders being particularly common. The obsessive-compulsive
symptoms observed in tic disorder tend to be characterized by more
aggressive symmetry and order symptoms and poorer response to
pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Children
with ADHD may demonstrate disruptive behavior, social immaturity, and
learning difficulties that may interfere with academic progress and
interpersonal relationships and lead to greater impairment than that
caused by a tic disorder. Individuals with tic disorders can also have
other movement disorders and other mental disorders, such as depressive,
bipolar, or substance use disorders.

Other Specified Tic Disorder

**307.20 (F95.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a tic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a tic
disorder or any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders
diagnostic class. The other specified tic disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for a tic
disorder or any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done by
recording "other specified tic disorder" followed by the specific reason
(e.g., "with onset after age 18 years").

Unspecified Tic Disorder

**307.20 (F95.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a tic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a tic
disorder or for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders
diagnostic class. The unspecified tic disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason
that the criteria are not met for a tic disorder or for a specific
neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes presentations in which there
is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a neurodevelopmental disorder that cause impairment in social,

An example of a presentation that can be specified using the "other

[]{#index_split_013.html#p132}**Schizophrenia Spectrum and**

**Other Psychotic Disorders**

Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders include
schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and schizotypal (personality)
disorder. They are defined by abnormalities in one or more of the
following five domains: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking
(speech), grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including
catatonia), and negative symptoms.

Key Features That Define the Psychotic Disorders

Delusions

*Delusions* are fixed beliefs that are not amenable to change in light
of conflicting evidence.

Their content may include a variety of themes (e.g., persecutory,
referential, somatic, religious, grandiose). *Persecutory delusions*
(i.e., belief that one is going to be harmed, harassed, and so forth by
an individual, organization, or other group) are most common.
*Referential* *delusions* (i.e., belief that certain gestures, comments,
environmental cues, and so forth are directed at oneself) are also
common. *Grandiose delusions* (i.e., when an individual believes that he
or she has exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame) and *erotomanic
delusions* (i.e., when an individual believes falsely that another
person is in love with him or her) are also seen.

*Nihilistic delusions* involve the conviction that a major catastrophe
will occur, and *somatic* *delusions* focus on preoccupations regarding
health and organ function.

Delusions are deemed *bizarre* if they are clearly implausible and not
understandable to same-culture peers and do not derive from ordinary
life experiences. An example of a bizarre delusion is the belief that an
outside force has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them
with someone else's organs without leaving any wounds or scars. An
example of a nonbizarre delusion is the belief that one is under
surveillance by the police, despite a lack of convincing evidence.
Delusions that express a loss of control over mind or body are generally
considered to be bizarre; these include the belief that one's thoughts
have been "removed" by some outside force ( *thought withdrawal*), that
alien thoughts have been put into one's mind ( *thought insertion*), or
that one's body or actions are being acted on or manipulated by some
outside force ( *delusions of control*). The distinction between a
delusion and a strongly held idea is sometimes difficult to make and
depends in part on the degree of conviction with which the belief is
held despite clear or reasonable contradictory evidence regarding its
veracity.

Hallucinations

*Hallucinations* are perception-like experiences that occur without an
external stimulus.

They are vivid and clear, with the full force and impact of normal
perceptions, and not under voluntary control. They may occur in any
sensory modality, but auditory hallucinations are the most common in
schizophrenia and related disorders. Auditory hallucinations are usually
experienced as voices, whether familiar or unfamiliar, that are
perceived as distinct from the individual's own thoughts. The
hallucinations must occur in the context of a clear sensorium; those
that occur while falling asleep ( *hypnagogic*) or waking up **87**

[]{#index_split_013.html#p133}**88**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

( *hypnopompic*) are considered to be within the range of normal
experience. Hallucinations may be a normal part of religious experience
in certain cultural contexts.

Disorganized Thinking (Speech)

*Disorganized thinking* ( *formal thought disorder*) is typically
inferred from the individual's speech. The individual may switch from
one topic to another ( *derailment or loose associations*). Answers to
questions may be obliquely related or completely unrelated (
*tangential-ity*). Rarely, speech may be so severely disorganized that
it is nearly incomprehensible and resembles receptive aphasia in its
linguistic disorganization ( *incoherence* or "word salad").

Because mildly disorganized speech is common and nonspecific, the
symptom must be severe enough to substantially impair effective
communication. The severity of the impairment may be difficult to
evaluate if the person making the diagnosis comes from a different
linguistic background than that of the person being examined. Less
severe disorganized thinking or speech may occur during the prodromal
and residual periods of schizophrenia.

Grossly Disorganized or Abnormal Motor Behavior

(Including Catatonia)

*Grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior* may manifest itself in
a variety of ways, ranging from childlike "silliness" to unpredictable
agitation. Problems may be noted in any form of goal-directed behavior,
leading to difficulties in performing activities of daily living.

*Catatonic behavior* is a marked decrease in reactivity to the
environment. This ranges from resistance to instructions (
*negativism*); to maintaining a rigid, inappropriate or bizarre posture;
to a complete lack of verbal and motor responses ( *mutism* and
*stupor*). It can also include purposeless and excessive motor activity
without obvious cause ( *catatonic* *excitement*). Other features are
repeated stereotyped movements, staring, grimacing, mutism, and the
echoing of speech. Although catatonia has historically been associated
with schizophrenia, catatonic symptoms are nonspecific and may occur in
other mental disorders (e.g., bipolar or depressive disorders with
catatonia) and in medical conditions (catatonic disorder due to another
medical condition).

Negative Symptoms

*Negative symptoms* account for a substantial portion of the morbidity
associated with schizophrenia but are less prominent in other psychotic
disorders. Two negative symptoms are particularly prominent in
schizophrenia: diminished emotional expression and avolition.
*Diminished emotional expression* includes reductions in the expression
of emotions in the face, eye contact, intonation of speech (prosody),
and movements of the hand, head, and face that normally give an
emotional emphasis to speech. *Avolition* is a decrease in motivated
self-initiated purposeful activities. The individual may sit for long
periods of time and show little interest in participating in work or
social activities. Other negative symptoms include alogia, anhedonia,
and asociality. *Alogia* is manifested by diminished speech output.
*Anhedonia* is the decreased ability to experience pleasure from
positive stimuli or a degradation in the recollection of pleasure
previously experienced. *Asociality* refers to the apparent lack of
interest in social interactions and may be associated with avolition,
but it can also be a manifestation of limited opportunities for social
interactions.

Disorders in This Chapter

This chapter is organized along a gradient of psychopathology.
Clinicians should first consider conditions that do not reach full
criteria for a psychotic disorder or are limited to one

[]{#index_split_013.html#p134}Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic
Disorders **89**

domain of psychopathology. Then they should consider time-limited
conditions. Finally, the diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder
requires the exclusion of another condition that may give rise to
psychosis.

Schizotypal personality disorder is noted within this chapter as it is
considered within the schizophrenia spectrum, although its full
description is found in the chapter "Personality Disorders." The
diagnosis schizotypal personality disorder captures a pervasive pattern
of social and interpersonal deficits, including reduced capacity for
close relationships; cognitive or perceptual distortions; and
eccentricities of behavior, usually beginning by early adulthood but in
some cases first becoming apparent in childhood and adolescence.

Abnormalities of beliefs, thinking, and perception are below the
threshold for the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.

Two conditions are defined by abnormalities limited to one domain of
psychosis: delusions or catatonia. Delusional disorder is characterized
by at least 1 month of delusions but no other psychotic symptoms.
Catatonia is described later in the chapter and further in this
discussion.

Brief psychotic disorder lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month.
Schizophreniform disorder is characterized by a symptomatic presentation
equivalent to that of schizophrenia except for its duration (less than 6
months) and the absence of a requirement for a decline in functioning.

Schizophrenia lasts for at least 6 months and includes at least 1 month
of active-phase symptoms. In schizoaffective disorder, a mood episode
and the active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia occur together and were
preceded or are followed by at least 2 weeks of delusions or
hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms.

Psychotic disorders may be induced by another condition. In
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, the psychotic symptoms
are judged to be a physiological consequence of a drug of abuse, a
medication, or toxin exposure and cease after removal of the agent. In
psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, the psychotic
symptoms are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another
medical condition.

Catatonia can occur in several disorders, including neurodevelopmental,
psychotic, bipolar, depressive, and other mental disorders. This chapter
also includes the diagnoses catatonia associated with another mental
disorder (catatonia specifier), catatonic disorder due to another
medical condition, and unspecified catatonia, and the diagnostic
criteria for all three conditions are described together.

Other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other
psychotic disorders are included for classifying psychotic presentations
that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific psychotic
disorders, or psychotic symptomatology about which there is inadequate
or contradictory information.

Clinician-Rated Assessment of Symptoms and

Related Clinical Phenomena in Psychosis

Psychotic disorders are heterogeneous, and the severity of symptoms can
predict important aspects of the illness, such as the degree of
cognitive or neurobiological deficits. To move the field forward, a
detailed framework for the assessment of severity is included in Section
III "Assessment Measures," which may help with treatment planning,
prognostic decision making, and research on pathophysiological
mechanisms. Section III "Assessment Measures" also contains dimensional
assessments of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including
hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech (except for substance/

medication-induced psychotic disorder and psychotic disorder due to
another medical condition), abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative
symptoms, as well as dimensional assessments of depression and mania.
The severity of mood symptoms in psychosis has prognostic value and
guides treatment. There is growing evidence that schizoaffective

[]{#index_split_013.html#p135}**90**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

disorder is not a distinct nosological category. Thus, dimensional
assessments of depression and mania for all psychotic disorders alert
clinicians to mood pathology and the need to treat where appropriate.
The Section III scale also includes a dimensional assessment of
cognitive impairment. Many individuals with psychotic disorders have
impairments in a range of cognitive domains that predict functional
status. Clinical neuropsychological assessment can help guide diagnosis
and treatment, but brief assessments without formal neuropsychological
assessment can provide useful information that can be sufficient for
diagnostic purposes. Formal neuropsychological testing, when conducted,
should be administered and scored by personnel trained in the use of
testing instruments. If a formal neuropsychological assessment is not
conducted, the clinician should use the best available information to
make a judgment. Further research on these assessments is necessary in
order to determine their clinical utility; thus, the assessments
available in Section III should serve as a prototype to stimulate such
research.

Schizotypal (Personality) Disorder

Criteria and text for schizotypal personality disorder can be found in
the chapter "Personality Disorders." Because this disorder is considered
part of the schizophrenia spectrum of disorders, and is labeled in this
section of ICD-9 and ICD-10 as schizotypal disorder, it is listed in
this chapter and discussed in detail in the DSM-5 chapter "Personality
Disorders."

Delusional Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**297.1 (F22)**

A. The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month or
longer.

B. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met.

**Note:** Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related
to the delusional theme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with
insects associated with delusions of infestation).

C. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications,
functioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously
bizarre or odd.

D. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been
brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods.

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or another medical condition and is not better explained by
another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

*Specify* whether:

**Erotomanic type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the
delusion is that another person is in love with the individual.

**Grandiose type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the
delusion is the conviction of having some great (but unrecognized)
talent or insight or having made some important discovery.

**Jealous type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the
individual's delusion is that his or her spouse or lover is unfaithful.

**Persecutory type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the
delusion involves the individual's belief that he or she is being
conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged,
maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the pursuit of
long-term goals.

**Somatic type:** This subtype applies when the central theme of the
delusion involves bodily functions or sensations.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p136}Delusional Disorder

**91**

**Mixed type:** This subtype applies when no one delusional theme
predominates.

**Unspecified type:** This subtype applies when the dominant delusional
belief cannot be clearly determined or is not described in the specific
types (e.g., referential delusions without a prominent persecutory or
grandiose component).

*Specify* if:

**With bizarre content:** Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are
clearly implausible, not understandable, and not derived from ordinary
life experiences (e.g., an individual's belief that a stranger has
removed his or her internal organs and replaced them with someone else's
organs without leaving any wounds or scars).

*Specify* if:

The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year
duration of the disorder: **First episode, currently in acute episode:**
First manifestation of the disorder meeting the defining diagnostic
symptom and time criteria. An *acute episode* is a time period in which
the symptom criteria are fulfilled.

**First episode, currently in partial remission:** *Partial remission*
is a time period during which an improvement after a previous episode is
maintained and in which the defining criteria of the disorder are only
partially fulfilled.

**First episode, currently in full remission:** *Full remission* is a
period of time after a previous episode during which no
disorder-specific symptoms are present.

**Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode**

**Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission**

**Multiple episodes, currently in full remission**

**Continuous:** Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of
the disorder are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with
subthreshold symptom periods being very brief relative to the overall
course.

**Unspecified**

*Specify* current severity:

Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms
of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech,
abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these
symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last
7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present
and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom
Severity in the chapter "Assessment Measures.") **Note:** Diagnosis of
delusional disorder can be made without using this severity specifier.

Subtypes

In *erotomanic type,* the central theme of the delusion is that another
person is in love with the individual. The person about whom this
conviction is held is usually of higher status (e.g., a famous
individual or a superior at work) but can be a complete stranger.
Efforts to contact the object of the delusion are common. In *grandiose
type,* the central theme of the delusion is the conviction of having
some great talent or insight or of having made some important discovery.
Less commonly, the individual may have the delusion of having a special
relationship with a prominent individual or of being a prominent person
(in which case the actual individual may be regarded as an impostor).
Grandiose delusions may have a religious content. In *jealous type,* the
central theme of the delusion is that of an unfaithful partner. This
belief is arrived at without due cause and is based on incorrect
inferences supported by small bits of "evidence" (e.g., disarrayed
clothing). The individual with the delusion usually confronts the spouse
or lover and attempts to intervene in the imagined infidelity. In
*persecutory type,* the central theme of the delusion involves the in-

[]{#index_split_013.html#p137}**92**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

dividual's belief of being conspired against, cheated, spied on,
followed, poisoned, maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the
pursuit of long-term goals. Small slights may be exaggerated and become
the focus of a delusional system. The affected individual may engage in
repeated attempts to obtain satisfaction by legal or legislative action.
Individuals with persecutory delusions are often resentful and angry and
may resort to violence against those they believe are hurting them. In
*somatic type,* the central theme of the delusion involves bodily
functions or sensations. Somatic delusions can occur in several forms.
Most common is the belief that the individual emits a foul odor; that
there is an infestation of insects on or in the skin; that there is an
internal parasite; that certain parts of the body are misshapen or ugly;
or that parts of the body are not functioning.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or
more delusions that persist for at least 1 month (Criterion A). A
diagnosis of delusional disorder is not given if the individual has ever
had a symptom presentation that met Criterion A for schizophrenia
(Criterion B). Apart from the direct impact of the delusions,
impairments in psychosocial functioning may be more circumscribed than
those seen in other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and
behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd (Criterion C). If mood episodes
occur concurrently with the delusions, the total duration of these mood
episodes is brief relative to the total duration of the delusional
periods (Criterion D). The delusions are not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical
condition (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and are not better explained by
another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or
obsessive-compulsive disorder (Criterion E).

In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the
diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania
symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions
between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Social, marital, or work problems can result from the delusional beliefs
of delusional disorder. Individuals with delusional disorder may be able
to factually describe that others view their beliefs as irrational but
are unable to accept this themselves (i.e., there may be

"factual insight" but no true insight). Many individuals develop
irritable or dysphoric mood, which can usually be understood as a
reaction to their delusional beliefs. Anger and violent behavior can
occur with persecutory, jealous, and erotomanic types. The individual
may engage in litigious or antagonistic behavior (e.g., sending hundreds
of letters of protest to the government). Legal difficulties can occur,
particularly in jealous and erotomanic types.

Prevalence

The lifetime prevalence of delusional disorder has been estimated at
around 0.2%, and the most frequent subtype is persecutory. Delusional
disorder, jealous type, is probably more common in males than in
females, but there are no major gender differences in the overall
frequency of delusional disorder.

Development and Course

On average, global function is generally better than that observed in
schizophrenia. Although the diagnosis is generally stable, a proportion
of individuals go on to develop

[]{#index_split_013.html#p138}Delusional Disorder

**93**

schizophrenia. Delusional disorder has a significant familial
relationship with both schizophrenia and schizotypal personality
disorder. Although it can occur in younger age groups, the condition may
be more prevalent in older individuals.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

An individual's cultural and religious background must be taken into
account in evaluating the possible presence of delusional disorder. The
content of delusions also varies across cultural contexts.

Functional Consequences of Delusional Disorder

The functional impairment is usually more circumscribed than that seen
with other psychotic disorders, although in some cases, the impairment
may be substantial and include poor occupational functioning and social
isolation. When poor psychosocial functioning is present, delusional
beliefs themselves often play a significant role. A common
characteristic of individuals with delusional disorder is the apparent
normality of their behavior and appearance when their delusional ideas
are not being discussed or acted on.

Differential Diagnosis

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

If an individual with obsessive-compulsive disorder is completely
convinced that his or her obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are
true, then the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, with absent
insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than a
diagnosis of delusional disorder.

Similarly, if an individual with body dysmorphic disorder is completely
convinced that his or her body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true,
then the diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder, with absent
insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than a
diagnosis of delusional disorder.

Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder due to
another medical condition, and substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder.

Individuals with these

disorders may present with symptoms that suggest delusional disorder.
For example, simple persecutory delusions in the context of major
neurocognitive disorder would be diagnosed as major neurocognitive
disorder, with behavioral disturbance. A substance/

medication-induced psychotic disorder cross-sectionally may be identical
in symptomatology to delusional disorder but can be distinguished by the
chronological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission
of the delusional beliefs.

Schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder.

Delusional disorder can be distinguished

from schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder by the absence of the
other characteristic symptoms of the active phase of schizophrenia.

Depressive and bipolar disorders and schizoaffective disorder.

These disorders may

be distinguished from delusional disorder by the temporal relationship
between the mood disturbance and the delusions and by the severity of
the mood symptoms. If delusions occur exclusively during mood episodes,
the diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features.
Mood symptoms that meet full criteria for a mood episode can be
superimposed on delusional disorder. Delusional disorder can be
diagnosed only if the total duration of all mood episodes remains brief
relative to the total duration of the delusional disturbance. If not,
then a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder accompanied by other specified
depressive disorder, unspecified depressive disorder, other specified
bipolar and related disorder, or unspecified bipolar and related
disorder is appropriate.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p139}**94**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Brief Psychotic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**298.8 (F23)**

A. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms. At least one of
these must be (1), (2), or (3):

1\. Delusions.

2\. Hallucinations.

3\. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).

4\. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.

**Note:** Do not include a symptom if it is a culturally sanctioned
response.

B. Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less
than 1 month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of
functioning.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or
bipolar disorder with psychotic features or another psychotic disorder
such as schizophrenia or catatonia, and is not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication) or another medical condition.

*Specify* if:

**With marked stressor(s)** (brief reactive psychosis): If symptoms
occur in response to events that, singly or together, would be markedly
stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in the individual's
culture.

**Without marked stressor(s):** If symptoms do not occur in response to
events that, singly or together, would be markedly stressful to almost
anyone in similar circumstances in the individual's culture.

**With postpartum onset:** If onset is during pregnancy or within 4
weeks postpartum.

*Specify* if:

**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with
another mental disorder, pp. 119--120, for definition)

**Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated
with brief psychotic disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid
catatonia.

*Specify* current severity:

Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms
of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech,
abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these
symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last
7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present
and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom
Severity in the chapter "Assessment Measures.") **Note:** Diagnosis of
brief psychotic disorder can be made without using this severity
specifier.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of brief psychotic disorder is a disturbance that
involves the sudden onset of at least one of the following positive
psychotic symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech
(e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence), or grossly abnormal
psychomotor behavior, including catatonia (Criterion A). *Sudden onset*
is defined as change from a nonpsychotic state to a clearly psychotic
state within 2 weeks, usually without a prodrome. An episode of the
disturbance lasts at least 1 day but less than 1 month, and the
individual eventually has a full return to the premorbid level of
functioning (Cri-

[]{#index_split_013.html#p140}Brief Psychotic Disorder

**95**

terion B). The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive or
bipolar disorder with psychotic features, by schizoaffective disorder,
or by schizophrenia and is not attributable to the physiological effects
of a substance (e.g., a hallucinogen) or another medical condition
(e.g., subdural hematoma) (Criterion C).

In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the
diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania
symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions
between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with brief psychotic disorder typically experience emotional
turmoil or overwhelming confusion. They may have rapid shifts from one
intense affect to another.

Although the disturbance is brief, the level of impairment may be
severe, and supervision may be required to ensure that nutritional and
hygienic needs are met and that the individual is protected from the
consequences of poor judgment, cognitive impairment, or acting on the
basis of delusions. There appears to be an increased risk of suicidal
behavior, particularly during the acute episode.

Prevalence

In the United States, brief psychotic disorder may account for 9% of
cases of first-onset psychosis. Psychotic disturbances that meet
Criteria A and C, but not Criterion B, for brief psychotic disorder
(i.e., duration of active symptoms is 1--6 months as opposed to
remission within 1 month) are more common in developing countries than
in developed countries. Brief psychotic disorder is twofold more common
in females than in males.

Development and Course

Brief psychotic disorder may appear in adolescence or early adulthood,
and onset can occur across the lifespan, with the average age at onset
being the mid 30s. By definition, a diagnosis of brief psychotic
disorder requires a full remission of all symptoms and an eventual full
return to the premorbid level of functioning within 1 month of the onset
of the disturbance. In some individuals, the duration of psychotic
symptoms may be quite brief (e.g., a few days).

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Preexisting personality disorders and traits (e.g., schizotypal
personality disorder; borderline personality disorder; or traits in the
psychoticism domain, such as perceptual dysregulation, and the negative
affectivity domain, such as suspiciousness) may predispose the
individual to the development of the disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

It is important to distinguish symptoms of brief psychotic disorder from
culturally sanctioned response patterns. For example, in some religious
ceremonies, an individual may report hearing voices, but these do not
generally persist and are not perceived as abnormal by most members of
the individual's community. In addition, cultural and religious
background must be taken into account when considering whether beliefs
are delusional.

Functional Consequences of Brief Psychotic Disorder

Despite high rates of relapse, for most individuals, outcome is
excellent in terms of social functioning and symptomatology.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p141}**96**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Differential Diagnosis

Other medical conditions.

A variety of medical disorders can manifest with psychotic symptoms of
short duration. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or a
delirium is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory tests that the delusions or hallucinations
are the direct physiological consequence of a specific medical condition
(e.g., Cushing's syndrome, brain tumor) (see "Psychotic Disorder Due to
Another Medical Condition" later in this chapter).

Substance-related disorders.

Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, substance-induced
delirium, and substance intoxication are distinguished from brief
psychotic disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,
a medication, exposure to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related
to the psychotic symptoms (see "Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic
Disorder" later in this chapter). Laboratory tests, such as a urine drug
screen or a blood alcohol level, may be helpful in making this
determination, as may a careful history of substance use with attention
to temporal relationships between substance intake and onset of the
symptoms and to the nature of the substance being used.

Depressive and bipolar disorders.

The diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder cannot be

made if the psychotic symptoms are better explained by a mood episode
(i.e., the psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a full major
depressive, manic, or mixed episode).

Other psychotic disorders.

If the psychotic symptoms persist for 1 month or longer, the diagnosis
is either schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, depressive
disorder with psychotic features, bipolar disorder with psychotic
features, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorder, depending on the other symptoms in the
presentation. The differential diagnosis between brief psychotic
disorder and schizophreniform disorder is difficult when the psychotic
symptoms have remitted before 1 month in response to successful
treatment with medication. Careful attention should be given to the
possibility that a recurrent disorder (e.g., bipolar disorder, recurrent
acute exacerbations of schizophrenia) may be responsible for any
recurring psychotic episodes.

Malingering and factitious disorders.

An episode of factitious disorder, with predominantly psychological
signs and symptoms, may have the appearance of brief psychotic disorder,
but in such cases there is evidence that the symptoms are intentionally
produced.

When malingering involves apparently psychotic symptoms, there is
usually evidence that the illness is being feigned for an understandable
goal.

Personality disorders.

In certain individuals with personality disorders, psychosocial
stressors may precipitate brief periods of psychotic symptoms. These
symptoms are usually transient and do not warrant a separate diagnosis.
If psychotic symptoms persist for at least 1 day, an additional
diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder may be appropriate.

Schizophreniform Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**295.40 (F20.81)**

A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant
portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully
treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):

1\. Delusions.

2\. Hallucinations.

3\. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).

4\. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.

5\. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or
avolition).

[]{#index_split_013.html#p142}Schizophreniform Disorder

**97**

B. An episode of the disorder lasts at least 1 month but less than 6
months. When the diagnosis must be made without waiting for recovery, it
should be qualified as "provisional."

C. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with
psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major
depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the
active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during
active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the
total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.

D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition.

*Specify* if:

**With good prognostic features:** This specifier requires the presence
of at least two of the following features: onset of prominent psychotic
symptoms within 4 weeks of the first noticeable change in usual behavior
or functioning; confusion or perplexity; good premorbid social and
occupational functioning; and absence of blunted or flat affect.

**Without good prognostic features:** This specifier is applied if two
or more of the above features have not been present.

*Specify* if:

**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with
another mental disorder, pp. 119--120, for definition).

**Coding note:** Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated
with schizophreniform disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid
catatonia.

*Specify* current severity:

Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms
of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech,
abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these
symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last
7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present
and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom
Severity in the chapter "Assessment Measures.") **Note:** Diagnosis of
schizophreniform disorder can be made without using this severity
specifier.

**Note:** For additional information on Associated Features Supporting
Diagnosis, Development and Course (age-related factors), Culture-Related
Diagnostic Issues, Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues, Differential
Diagnosis, and Comorbidity, see the corresponding sections in
schizophrenia.

Diagnostic Features

The characteristic symptoms of schizophreniform disorder are identical
to those of schizophrenia (Criterion A). Schizophreniform disorder is
distinguished by its difference in duration: the total duration of the
illness, including prodromal, active, and residual phases, is at least 1
month but less than 6 months (Criterion B). The duration requirement for
schizophreniform disorder is intermediate between that for brief
psychotic disorder, which lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month,
and schizophrenia, which lasts for at least 6 months.

The diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made under two
conditions. 1) when an episode of illness lasts between 1 and 6 months
and the individual has already recovered, and 2) when an individual is
symptomatic for less than the 6 months' duration required for the
diagnosis of schizophrenia but has not yet recovered. In this case, the
diagnosis should be noted as "schizophreniform disorder (provisional)"
because it is uncertain if the individual will recover from the
disturbance within the 6-month period. If the disturbance persists
beyond 6 months, the diagnosis should be changed to schizophrenia.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p143}**98**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Another distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack
of a criterion requiring impaired social and occupational functioning.
While such impairments may potentially be present, they are not
necessary for a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder.

In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the
diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania
symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions
between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

As with schizophrenia, currently there are no laboratory or psychometric
tests for schizophreniform disorder. There are multiple brain regions
where neuroimaging, neuropathological, and neurophysiological research
has indicated abnormalities, but none are diagnostic.

Prevalence

Incidence of schizophreniform disorder across sociocultural settings is
likely similar to that observed in schizophrenia. In the United States
and other developed countries, the incidence is low, possibly fivefold
less than that of schizophrenia. In developing countries, the incidence
may be higher, especially for the specifier "with good prognostic
features"; in some of these settings schizophreniform disorder may be as
common as schizophrenia.

Development and Course

The development of schizophreniform disorder is similar to that of
schizophrenia. About one-third of individuals with an initial diagnosis
of schizophreniform disorder (provisional) recover within the 6-month
period and schizophreniform disorder is their final diagnosis. The
majority of the remaining two-thirds of individuals will eventually
receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Relatives of individuals with schizophreniform disorder have an
increased risk for schizophrenia.

Functional Consequences of

Schizophreniform Disorder

For the majority of individuals with schizophreniform disorder who
eventually receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective
disorder, the functional consequences are similar to the consequences of
those disorders. Most individuals experience dysfunction in several
areas of daily functioning, such as school or work, interpersonal
relationships, and self-care. Individuals who recover from
schizophreniform disorder have better functional outcomes.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders and medical conditions.

A wide variety of mental and medical

conditions can manifest with psychotic symptoms that must be considered
in the differential diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. These
include psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or its
treatment; delirium or major neurocognitive disorder;
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or delirium; depressive
or bipolar disorder with psychotic features; schizoaffective disorder;
other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder; depressive
or bipolar disorder with catatonic features; schizophre-

**99**

nia; brief psychotic disorder; delusional disorder; other specified or
unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder;
schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality disorders; autism
spectrum disorder; disorders presenting in childhood with disorganized
speech; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; obsessive-compulsive
disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder; and traumatic brain injury.

Since the diagnostic criteria for schizophreniform disorder and
schizophrenia differ primarily in duration of illness, the discussion of
the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia also applies to
schizophreniform disorder.

Brief psychotic disorder.

Schizophreniform disorder differs in duration from brief psychotic
disorder, which has a duration of less than 1 month.

Schizophrenia

Diagnostic Criteria

**295.90 (F20.9)**

A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant
portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully
treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3): 1. Delusions.

2\. Hallucinations.

3\. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).

4\. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.

5\. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or
avolition).

B. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the
disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as
work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level
achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or
adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of
interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).

C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months.
This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less
if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase
symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms.
During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance
may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms
listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs,
unusual perceptual experiences).

D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with
psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major
depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the
active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during
active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the
total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition.

F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication
disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia
is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to
the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at
least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).

*Specify* if:

The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year
duration of the disorder and if they are not in contradiction to the
diagnostic course criteria.

**First episode, currently in acute episode:** First manifestation of
the disorder meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria.
An *acute episode* is a time period in which the symptom criteria are
fulfilled.

**First episode, currently in partial remission:** *Partial remission*
is a period of time during which an improvement after a previous episode
is maintained and in which the defining criteria of the disorder are
only partially fulfilled.

**First episode, currently in full remission:** *Full remission* is a
period of time after a previous episode during which no
disorder-specific symptoms are present.

**Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode:** Multiple episodes may
be determined after a minimum of two episodes (i.e., after a first
episode, a remission and a minimum of one relapse).

**Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission**

**Multiple episodes, currently in full remission**

**Continuous:** Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of
the disorder are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with
subthreshold symptom periods being very brief relative to the overall
course.

**Unspecified**

*Specify* if:

**With catatonia** (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with
another mental disorder, pp. 119--120, for definition).

*Specify* current severity:

Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms
of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech,
abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these
symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last
7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present
and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom
Severity in the chapter "Assessment Measures.") **Note:** Diagnosis of
schizophrenia can be made without using this severity specifier.

Diagnostic Features

The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia involve a range of
cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dysfunctions, but no single symptom
is pathognomonic of the disorder. The diagnosis involves the recognition
of a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with impaired
occupational or social functioning. Individuals with the disorder will
vary substantially on most features, as schizophrenia is a heterogeneous
clinical syndrome.

At least two Criterion A symptoms must be present for a significant
portion of time during a 1-month period or longer. At least one of these
symptoms must be the clear presence of delusions (Criterion A1),
hallucinations (Criterion A2), or disorganized speech (Criterion A3).
Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior (Criterion A4) and negative
symptoms (Criterion A5) may also be present. In those situations in
which the active-phase symptoms remit within a month in response to
treatment, Criterion A is still met if the clinician estimates that they
would have persisted in the absence of treatment.

Schizophrenia involves impairment in one or more major areas of
functioning (Criterion B). If the disturbance begins in childhood or
adolescence, the expected level of function is not attained. Comparing
the individual with unaffected siblings may be helpful. The dysfunction
persists for a substantial period during the course of the disorder and
does not appear to be a direct result of any single feature. Avolition
(i.e., reduced drive to pursue goal-directed behavior; Criterion A5) is
linked to the social dysfunction described under Criterion B. There is
also strong evidence for a relationship between cognitive impairment
(see the section "Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis" for this
disorder) and functional impairment in individuals with schizophrenia.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p146}Schizophrenia

**101**

Some signs of the disturbance must persist for a continuous period of at
least 6 months (Criterion C). Prodromal symptoms often precede the
active phase, and residual symptoms may follow it, characterized by mild
or subthreshold forms of hallucinations or delusions. Individuals may
express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are not of delusional
proportions (e.g., ideas of reference or magical thinking); they may
have unusual perceptual experiences (e.g., sensing the presence of an
unseen person); their speech may be generally understandable but vague;
and their behavior may be unusual but not grossly disorganized (e.g.,
mumbling in public). Negative symptoms are common in the prodromal and
residual phases and can be severe. Individuals who had been socially
active may become withdrawn from previous routines. Such behaviors are
often the first sign of a disorder.

Mood symptoms and full mood episodes are common in schizophrenia and may
be concurrent with active-phase symptomatology. However, as distinct
from a psychotic mood disorder, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires the
presence of delusions or hallucinations in the absence of mood episodes.
In addition, mood episodes, taken in total, should be present for only a
minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the
illness.

In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the
diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania
symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions
between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with schizophrenia may display inappropriate affect (e.g.,
laughing in the absence of an appropriate stimulus); a dysphoric mood
that can take the form of depression, anxiety, or anger; a disturbed
sleep pattern (e.g., daytime sleeping and nighttime activity); and a
lack of interest in eating or food refusal. Depersonalization,
derealization, and somatic concerns may occur and sometimes reach
delusional proportions. Anxiety and phobias are common. Cognitive
deficits in schizophrenia are common and are strongly linked to
vocational and functional impairments. These deficits can include
decrements in declarative memory, working memory, language function, and
other executive functions, as well as slower processing speed.
Abnormalities in sensory processing and inhibitory capacity, as well as
reductions in attention, are also found. Some individuals with
schizophrenia show social cognition deficits, including deficits in the
ability to infer the intentions of other people (theory of mind), and
may attend to and then interpret irrelevant events or stimuli as
meaningful, perhaps leading to the generation of explanatory delusions.
These impairments frequently persist during symptomatic remission.

Some individuals with psychosis may lack insight or awareness of their
disorder (i.e., anosognosia). This lack of "insight" includes
unawareness of symptoms of schizophrenia and may be present throughout
the entire course of the illness. Unawareness of illness is typically a
symptom of schizophrenia itself rather than a coping strategy. It is
comparable to the lack of awareness of neurological deficits following
brain damage, termed *anosognosia.* This symptom is the most common
predictor of nonadherence to treatment, and it predicts higher relapse
rates, increased number of involuntary treatments, poorer psychosocial
functioning, aggression, and a poorer course of illness.

Hostility and aggression can be associated with schizophrenia, although
spontaneous or random assault is uncommon. Aggression is more frequent
for younger males and for individuals with a past history of violence,
nonadherence with treatment, substance abuse, and impulsivity. It should
be noted that the vast majority of persons with schizophrenia are not
aggressive and are more frequently victimized than are individuals in
the general population.

Currently, there are no radiological, laboratory, or psychometric tests
for the disorder.

Differences are evident in multiple brain regions between groups of
healthy individuals

[]{#index_split_013.html#p147}**102**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

and persons with schizophrenia, including evidence from neuroimaging,
neuropathological, and neurophysiological studies. Differences are also
evident in cellular architecture, white matter connectivity, and gray
matter volume in a variety of regions such as the prefrontal and
temporal cortices. Reduced overall brain volume has been observed, as
well as increased brain volume reduction with age. Brain volume
reductions with age are more pronounced in individuals with
schizophrenia than in healthy individuals. Finally, individuals with
schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in
eye-tracking and electrophysiological indices.

Neurological soft signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include
impairments in motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor
sequencing of complex movements; left-right confusion; and disinhibition
of associated movements. In addition, minor physical anomalies of the
face and limbs may occur.

Prevalence

The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia appears to be approximately
0.3%--0.7%, although there is reported variation by race/ethnicity,
across countries, and by geographic origin for immigrants and children
of immigrants. The sex ratio differs across samples and populations: for
example, an emphasis on negative symptoms and longer duration of
disorder (associated with poorer outcome) shows higher incidence rates
for males, whereas definitions allowing for the inclusion of more mood
symptoms and brief presentations (associated with better outcome) show
equivalent risks for both sexes.

Development and Course

The psychotic features of schizophrenia typically emerge between the
late teens and the mid-30s; onset prior to adolescence is rare. The peak
age at onset for the first psychotic episode is in the early-to mid-20s
for males and in the late-20s for females. The onset may be abrupt or
insidious, but the majority of individuals manifest a slow and gradual
development of a variety of clinically significant signs and symptoms.
Half of these individuals complain of depressive symptoms. Earlier age
at onset has traditionally been seen as a predictor of worse prognosis.
However, the effect of age at onset is likely related to gender, with
males having worse premorbid adjustment, lower educational achievement,
more prominent negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, and in
general a worse outcome. Impaired cognition is common, and alterations
in cognition are present during development and precede the emergence of
psychosis, taking the form of stable cognitive impairments during
adulthood. Cognitive impairments may persist when other symptoms are in
remission and contribute to the disability of the disease.

The predictors of course and outcome are largely unexplained, and course
and outcome may not be reliably predicted. The course appears to be
favorable in about 20% of those with schizophrenia, and a small number
of individuals are reported to recover completely.

However, most individuals with schizophrenia still require formal or
informal daily living supports, and many remain chronically ill, with
exacerbations and remissions of active symptoms, while others have a
course of progressive deterioration.

Psychotic symptoms tend to diminish over the life course, perhaps in
association with normal age-related declines in dopamine activity.
Negative symptoms are more closely related to prognosis than are
positive symptoms and tend to be the most persistent. Furthermore,
cognitive deficits associated with the illness may not improve over the
course of the illness.

The essential features of schizophrenia are the same in childhood, but
it is more difficult to make the diagnosis. In children, delusions and
hallucinations may be less elaborate than in adults, and visual
hallucinations are more common and should be distinguished from normal
fantasy play. Disorganized speech occurs in many disorders with
childhood onset (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), as does disorganized
behavior (e.g., attention-deficit/

[]{#index_split_013.html#p148}Schizophrenia

**103**

hyperactivity disorder). These symptoms should not be attributed to
schizophrenia without due consideration of the more common disorders of
childhood. Childhood-onset cases tend to resemble poor-outcome adult
cases, with gradual onset and prominent negative symptoms. Children who
later receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia are more likely to have
experienced nonspecific emotional-behavioral disturbances and
psychopathology, intellectual and language alterations, and subtle motor
delays.

Late-onset cases (i.e., onset after age 40 years) are overrepresented by
females, who may have married. Often, the course is characterized by a
predominance of psychotic symptoms with preservation of affect and
social functioning. Such late-onset cases can still meet the diagnostic
criteria for schizophrenia, but it is not yet clear whether this is the
same condition as schizophrenia diagnosed prior to midlife (e.g., prior
to age 55 years).

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Season of birth has been linked to the incidence of schizophrenia,
including late winter/early spring in some locations and summer for the
deficit form of the disease. The incidence of schizophrenia and related
disorders is higher for children growing up in an urban environment and
for some minority ethnic groups.

Genetic and physiological.

There is a strong contribution for genetic factors in determining risk
for schizophrenia, although most individuals who have been diagnosed
with schizophrenia have no family history of psychosis. Liability is
conferred by a spectrum of risk alleles, common and rare, with each
allele contributing only a small fraction to the total population
variance. The risk alleles identified to date are also associated with
other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, depression, and
autism spectrum disorder.

Pregnancy and birth complications with hypoxia and greater paternal age
are associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia for the developing
fetus. In addition, other prenatal and perinatal adversities, including
stress, infection, malnutrition, maternal diabetes, and other medical
conditions, have been linked with schizophrenia. However, the vast
majority of offspring with these risk factors do not develop
schizophrenia.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly when
the individual and the clinician do not share the same cultural and
socioeconomic background. Ideas that appear to be delusional in one
culture (e.g., witchcraft) may be commonly held in another.

In some cultures, visual or auditory hallucinations with a religious
content (e.g., hearing God's voice) are a normal part of religious
experience. In addition, the assessment of disorganized speech may be
made difficult by linguistic variation in narrative styles across
cultures. The assessment of affect requires sensitivity to differences
in styles of emotional expression, eye contact, and body language, which
vary across cultures. If the assessment is conducted in a language that
is different from the individual's primary language, care must be taken
to ensure that alogia is not related to linguistic barriers. In certain
cultures, distress may take the form of hallucinations or
pseudo-hallucinations and overvalued ideas that may present clinically
similar to true psychosis but are normative to the patient's subgroup.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

A number of features distinguish the clinical expression of
schizophrenia in females and males. The general incidence of
schizophrenia tends to be slightly lower in females, particularly among
treated cases. The age at onset is later in females, with a second
midlife peak as described earlier (see the section "Development and
Course" for this disorder).

Symptoms tend to be more affect-laden among females, and there are more
psychotic symptoms, as well as a greater propensity for psychotic
symptoms to worsen in later life.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p149}**104**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Other symptom differences include less frequent negative symptoms and
disorganization.

Finally, social functioning tends to remain better preserved in females.
There are, however, frequent exceptions to these general caveats.

Suicide Risk

Approximately 5%--6% of individuals with schizophrenia die by suicide,
about 20% attempt suicide on one or more occasions, and many more have
significant suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior is sometimes in
response to command hallucinations to harm oneself or others.

Suicide risk remains high over the whole lifespan for males and females,
although it may be especially high for younger males with comorbid
substance use. Other risk factors include having depressive symptoms or
feelings of hopelessness and being unemployed, and the risk is higher,
also, in the period after a psychotic episode or hospital discharge.

Functional Consequences of Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is associated with significant social and occupational
dysfunction. Making educational progress and maintaining employment are
frequently impaired by avolition or other disorder manifestations, even
when the cognitive skills are sufficient for the tasks at hand. Most
individuals are employed at a lower level than their parents, and most,
particularly men, do not marry or have limited social contacts outside
of their family.

Differential Diagnosis

Major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic or catatonic
features.

The distinction between schizophrenia and major depressive or bipolar
disorder with psychotic features or with catatonia depends on the
temporal relationship between the mood disturbance and the psychosis,
and on the severity of the depressive or manic symptoms. If delusions or
hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive or manic
episode, the diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic
features.

Schizoaffective disorder.

A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that a major depressive
or manic episode occur concurrently with the active-phase symptoms and
that the mood symptoms be present for a majority of the total duration
of the active periods.

Schizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic disorder.

These disorders are of shorter

duration than schizophrenia as specified in Criterion C, which requires
6 months of symptoms. In schizophreniform disorder, the disturbance is
present less than 6 months, and in brief psychotic disorder, symptoms
are present at least 1 day but less than 1 month.

Delusional disorder.

Delusional disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by the
absence of the other symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia (e.g.,
delusions, prominent auditory or visual hallucinations, disorganized
speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms).

Schizotypal personality disorder.

Schizotypal personality disorder may be distinguished from schizophrenia
by subthreshold symptoms that are associated with persistent personality
features.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder.

Individuals with

obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder may present
with poor or absent insight, and the preoccupations may reach delusional
proportions. But these disorders are distinguished from schizophrenia by
their prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance
or body odor, hoarding, or body-focused repetitive behaviors.

Posttraumatic stress disorder.

Posttraumatic stress disorder may include flashbacks that have a
hallucinatory quality, and hypervigilance may reach paranoid
proportions. But a trau-

[]{#index_split_013.html#p150}Schizoaffective Disorder

**105**

matic event and characteristic symptom features relating to reliving or
reacting to the event are required to make the diagnosis.

Autism spectrum disorder or communication disorders.

These disorders may also have

symptoms resembling a psychotic episode but are distinguished by their
respective deficits in social interaction with repetitive and restricted
behaviors and other cognitive and communication deficits. An individual
with autism spectrum disorder or communication disorder must have
symptoms that meet full criteria for schizophrenia, with prominent
hallucinations or delusions for at least 1 month, in order to be
diagnosed with schizophrenia as a comorbid condition.

Other mental disorders associated with a psychotic episode.

The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only when the psychotic episode
is persistent and not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or another medical condition. Individuals with a delirium or
major or minor neurocognitive disorder may present with psychotic
symptoms, but these would have a temporal relationship to the onset of
cognitive changes consistent with those disorders. Individuals with
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder may present with
symptoms characteristic of Criterion A for schizophrenia, but the
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder can usually be
distinguished by the chronological relationship of substance use to the
onset and remission of the psychosis in the absence of substance use.

Comorbidity

Rates of comorbidity with substance-related disorders are high in
schizophrenia. Over half of individuals with schizophrenia have tobacco
use disorder and smoke cigarettes regularly. Comorbidity with anxiety
disorders is increasingly recognized in schizophrenia. Rates of
obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are elevated in
individuals with schizophrenia compared with the general population.
Schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder may sometimes precede the
onset of schizophrenia.

Life expectancy is reduced in individuals with schizophrenia because of
associated medical conditions. Weight gain, diabetes, metabolic
syndrome, and cardiovascular and pulmonary disease are more common in
schizophrenia than in the general population.

Poor engagement in health maintenance behaviors (e.g., cancer screening,
exercise) increases the risk of chronic disease, but other disorder
factors, including medications, lifestyle, cigarette smoking, and diet,
may also play a role. A shared vulnerability for psychosis and medical
disorders may explain some of the medical comorbidity of schizophrenia.

Schizoaffective Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. An uninterrupted period of illness during which there is a major mood
episode (major depressive or manic) concurrent with Criterion A of
schizophrenia.

**Note:** The major depressive episode must include Criterion A1:
Depressed mood.

B. Delusions or hallucinations for 2 or more weeks in the absence of a
major mood episode (depressive or manic) during the lifetime duration of
the illness.

C. Symptoms that meet criteria for a major mood episode are present for
the majority of the total duration of the active and residual portions
of the illness.

D. The disturbance is not attributable to the effects of a substance
(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

respective chapters.

Diagnostic Features

The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is based on the assessment of
an uninterrupted period of illness during which the individual continues
to display active or residual symptoms of psychotic illness. The
diagnosis is usually, but not necessarily, made during the period of
psychotic illness. At some time during the period, Criterion A for
schizophrenia

[]{#index_split_013.html#p152}Schizoaffective Disorder

**107**

has to be met. Criteria B (social dysfunction) and F (exclusion of
autism spectrum disorder or other communication disorder of childhood
onset) for schizophrenia do not have to be met. In addition to meeting
Criterion A for schizophrenia, there is a major mood episode (major
depressive or manic) (Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder). Because
loss of interest or pleasure is common in schizophrenia, to meet
Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder, the major depressive episode
must include pervasive depressed mood (i.e., the presence of markedly
diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficient). Episodes of
depression or mania are present for the majority of the total duration
of the illness (i.e., after Criterion A has been met) (Criterion C for
schizoaffective disorder). To separate schizoaffective disorder from a
depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, delusions or
hallucinations must be present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a
major mood episode (depressive or manic) at some point during the
lifetime duration of the illness (Criterion B for schizoaffective
disorder). The symptoms must not be attributable to the effects of a
substance or another medical condition (Criterion D for schizoaffective
disorder).

Criterion C for schizoaffective disorder specifies that mood symptoms
meeting criteria for a major mood episode must be present for the
majority of the total duration of the active and residual portion of the
illness. Criterion C requires the assessment of mood symptoms for the
entire course of a psychotic illness, which differs from the criterion
in DSM-IV, which required only an assessment of the current period of
illness. If the mood symptoms are present for only a relatively brief
period, the diagnosis is schizophrenia, not schizoaffective disorder.
When deciding whether an individual's presentation meets Criterion C,
the clinician should review the total duration of psychotic illness
(i.e., both active and residual symptoms) and determine when significant
mood symptoms (untreated or in need of treatment with antidepressant
and/or mood-stabilizing medication) accompanied the psychotic symptoms.
This determination requires sufficient historical information and
clinical judgment. For example, an individual with a 4-year history of
active and residual symptoms of schizophrenia develops depressive and
manic episodes that, taken together, do not occupy more than 1 year
during the 4-year history of psychotic illness. This presentation would
not meet Criterion C.

In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the
diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania
symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions
between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Occupational functioning is frequently impaired, but this is not a
defining criterion (in contrast to schizophrenia). Restricted social
contact and difficulties with self-care are associated with
schizoaffective disorder, but negative symptoms may be less severe and
less persistent than those seen in schizophrenia. Anosognosia (i.e.,
poor insight) is also common in schizoaffective disorder, but the
deficits in insight may be less severe and pervasive than those in
schizophrenia. Individuals with schizoaffective disorder may be at
increased risk for later developing episodes of major depressive
disorder or bipolar disorder if mood symptoms continue following the
remission of symptoms meeting Criterion A for schizophrenia. There may
be associated alcohol and other substance-related disorders.

There are no tests or biological measures that can assist in making the
diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. Whether schizoaffective disorder
differs from schizophrenia with regard to associated features such as
structural or functional brain abnormalities, cognitive deficits, or
genetic risk factors is not clear.

Prevalence

Schizoaffective disorder appears to be about one-third as common as
schizophrenia. Lifetime prevalence of schizoaffective disorder is
estimated to be 0.3%. The incidence of

[]{#index_split_013.html#p153}**108**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

schizoaffective disorder is higher in females than in males, mainly due
to an increased incidence of the depressive type among females.

Development and Course

The typical age at onset of schizoaffective disorder is early adulthood,
although onset can occur anywhere from adolescence to late in life. A
significant number of individuals diagnosed with another psychotic
illness initially will receive the diagnosis schizoaffective disorder
later when the pattern of mood episodes has become more apparent. With
the current diagnostic Criterion C, it is expected that the diagnosis
for some individuals will convert from schizoaffective disorder to
another disorder as mood symptoms become less prominent. The prognosis
for schizoaffective disorder is somewhat better than the prognosis for
schizophrenia but worse than the prognosis for mood disorders.

Schizoaffective disorder may occur in a variety of temporal patterns.
The following is a typical pattern: An individual may have pronounced
auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions for 2 months before
the onset of a prominent major depressive episode.

The psychotic symptoms and the full major depressive episode are then
present for 3 months.

Then, the individual recovers completely from the major depressive
episode, but the psychotic symptoms persist for another month before
they too disappear. During this period of illness, the individual's
symptoms concurrently met criteria for a major depressive episode and
Criterion A for schizophrenia, and during this same period of illness,
auditory hallucinations and delusions were present both before and after
the depressive phase. The total period of illness lasted for about 6
months, with psychotic symptoms alone present during the initial 2
months, both depressive and psychotic symptoms present during the next 3
months, and psychotic symptoms alone present during the last month. In
this instance, the duration of the depressive episode was not brief
relative to the total duration of the psychotic disturbance, and thus
the presentation qualifies for a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.

The expression of psychotic symptoms across the lifespan is variable.
Depressive or manic symptoms can occur before the onset of psychosis,
during acute psychotic episodes, during residual periods, and after
cessation of psychosis. For example, an individual might present with
prominent mood symptoms during the prodromal stage of schizophrenia.
This pattern is not necessarily indicative of schizoaffective disorder,
since it is the co-occurrence of psychotic and mood symptoms that is
diagnostic. For an individual with symptoms that clearly meet the
criteria for schizoaffective disorder but who on further follow-up only
presents with residual psychotic symptoms (such as subthreshold
psychosis and/or prominent negative symptoms), the diagnosis may be
changed to schizophrenia, as the total proportion of psychotic illness
compared with mood symptoms becomes more prominent. Schizoaffective
disorder, bipolar type, may be more common in young adults, whereas
schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, may be more common in older
adults.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Among individuals with schizophrenia, there may be an increased risk for
schizoaffective disorder in first-degree relatives. The risk for
schizoaffective disorder may be increased among individuals who have a
first-degree relative with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or
schizoaffective disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly when
the individual and the clinician do not share the same cultural and
economic background. Ideas that appear to be delusional in one culture
(e.g., witchcraft) may be commonly held in another.

There is also some evidence in the literature for the overdiagnosis of
schizophrenia com-

[]{#index_split_013.html#p154}Schizoaffective Disorder

**109**

pared with schizoaffective disorder in African American and Hispanic
populations, so care must be taken to ensure a culturally appropriate
evaluation that includes both psychotic and affective symptoms.

Suicide Risk

The lifetime risk of suicide for schizophrenia and schizoaffective
disorder is 5%, and the presence of depressive symptoms is correlated
with a higher risk for suicide. There is evidence that suicide rates are
higher in North American populations than in European, Eastern European,
South American, and Indian populations of individuals with schizophrenia
or schizoaffective disorder.

Functional Consequences of Schizoaffective Disorder

Schizoaffective disorder is associated with social and occupational
dysfunction, but dysfunction is not a diagnostic criterion (as it is for
schizophrenia), and there is substantial variability between individuals
diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders and medical conditions.

A wide variety of psychiatric and medical conditions can manifest with
psychotic and mood symptoms that must be considered in the differential
diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. These include psychotic disorder
due to another medical condition; delirium; major neurocognitive
disorder; substance/

medication-induced psychotic disorder or neurocognitive disorder;
bipolar disorders with psychotic features; major depressive disorder
with psychotic features; depressive or bipolar disorders with catatonic
features; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality disorder; brief
psychotic disorder; schizophreniform disorder; schizophrenia; delusional
disorder; and other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorders. Medical conditions and substance use can
present with a combination of psychotic and mood symptoms, and thus
psychotic disorder due to another medical condition needs to be
excluded. Distinguishing schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia and
from depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic features is often
difficult. Criterion C is designed to separate schizoaffective disorder
from schizophrenia, and Criterion B is designed to distinguish
schizoaffective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder with
psychotic features. More specifically, schizoaffective disorder can be
distinguished from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic
features due to the presence of prominent delusions and/or
hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood
episode. In contrast, in depressive or bipolar disorders with psychotic
features, the psychotic features primarily occur during the mood
episode(s). Because the relative proportion of mood to psychotic
symptoms may change over time, the appropriate diagnosis may change from
and to schizoaffective disorder (e.g., a diagnosis of schizoaffective
disorder for a severe and prominent major depressive episode lasting 3
months during the first 6 months of a persistent psychotic illness would
be changed to schizophrenia if active psychotic or prominent residual
symptoms persist over several years without a recurrence of another mood
episode).

Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition.

Other medical conditions and

substance use can manifest with a combination of psychotic and mood
symptoms, and thus psychotic disorder due to another medical condition
needs to be excluded.

Schizophrenia, bipolar, and depressive disorders.

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. More
specifically, schizoaffective disorder can be distinguished from a
depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features based on the
presence of prominent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2
weeks in the absence of a major mood episode. In contrast, in depressive
or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, the psychotic features
primarily occur during the mood episode(s). Because the relative
proportion of mood to psychotic symptoms may change over time, the
appropriate diagnosis may change from and to schizoaffective disorder.
(For example, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder for a severe and
prominent major depressive episode lasting 3 months during the first 6
months of a chronic psychotic illness would be changed to schizophrenia
if active psychotic or prominent residual symptoms persist over several
years without a recurrence of another mood episode.) Comorbidity

Many individuals diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder are also
diagnosed with other mental disorders, especially substance use
disorders and anxiety disorders. Similarly, the incidence of medical
conditions is increased above base rate for the general population and
leads to decreased life expectancy.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Psychotic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. Presence of one or both of the following symptoms: 1. Delusions.

2\. Hallucinations.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):

1\. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance
intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.

2\. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the
symptoms in Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a psychotic disorder that
is not substance/

medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent psychotic disorder
could include the following:

The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month)
after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there
is other evidence of an independent nonsubstance/medication-induced
psychotic disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent
nonsubstance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of
substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in
Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are
sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

Disorder **111**

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-induced psychotic disorders are indicated in the
table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not
there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of
substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is "1,"
and the clinician should record "mild \[substance\] use disorder" before
the substance-induced psychotic disorder (e.g., "mild cocaine use
disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder"). If a moderate or
severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced
psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is "2," and the clinician
should record "moderate \[substance\]

use disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder," depending on the
severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid
substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), then the 4th position character is "9," and the clinician
should record only the substance-induced psychotic disorder.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p157}**112**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Recording Procedures

ICD-9-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder begins
with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is
presumed to be causing the delusions or hallucinations. The diagnostic
code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is
based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the
classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for "other substance" should be
used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological
factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category
"unknown substance" should be used.

The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the
recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-induced
disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a
separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For
example, in the case of delusions occurring during intoxication in a man
with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.9
cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication. An
additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also
given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role
in the development of psychotic symptoms, each should be listed
separately (e.g., 292.9 cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with onset
during intoxication, with severe cannabis use disorder; 292.9

phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during
intoxication, with mild phencyclidine use disorder).

ICD-10-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder begins
with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is
presumed to be causing the delusions or hallucinations. The diagnostic
code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is
based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance
use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes
(e.g., dexamethasone), the code for "other substance" with no comorbid
substance use should be used; and in cases in which a substance is
judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance
is unknown, the category "unknown substance" with no comorbid substance
use should be used.

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the substance-induced psychotic disorder, followed by the
specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during
withdrawal). For example, in the case of delusions occurring during
intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis
is F14.259 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic
disorder, with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the
comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the
substance-induced psychotic disorder occurs without a comorbid substance
use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no
accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.959
phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during
intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of psychotic symptoms, each should
be listed separately (e.g., F12.259 severe cannabis use disorder with
cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication;
F16.159 mild phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced
psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication).

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder are prominent delusions and/or hallucinations (Criterion A)
that are judged to be due to the physiological effects of a
substance/medication (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin
exposure) (Criterion B). Hallucinations that the individual realizes are
substance/medication-induced are not included here and instead would be
diagnosed as substance intoxication
[]{#index_split_013.html#p158}Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic
Disorder **113**

or substance withdrawal with the accompanying specifier "with perceptual
disturbances"

(applies to alcohol withdrawal; cannabis intoxication; sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; and stimulant intoxication).

A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is distinguished from
a primary psychotic disorder by considering the onset, course, and other
factors. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history,
physical examination, or laboratory findings of substance use,
intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorders arise during or soon after exposure to a medication or after
substance intoxication or withdrawal but can persist for weeks, whereas
primary psychotic disorders may precede the onset of
substance/medication use or may occur during times of sustained
abstinence. Once initiated, the psychotic symptoms may continue as long
as the substance/

medication use continues. Another consideration is the presence of
features that are atypical of a primary psychotic disorder (e.g.,
atypical age at onset or course). For example, the appearance of
delusions de novo in a person older than 35 years without a known
history of a primary psychotic disorder should suggest the possibility
of a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Even a prior
history of a primary psychotic disorder does not rule out the
possibility of a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. In
contrast, factors that suggest that the psychotic symptoms are better
accounted for by a primary psychotic disorder include persistence of
psychotic symptoms for a substantial period of time (i.e., a month or
more) after the end of substance intoxication or acute substance
withdrawal or after cessation of medication use; or a history of prior
recurrent primary psychotic disorders. Other causes of psychotic
symptoms must be considered even in an individual with substance
intoxication or withdrawal, because substance use problems are not
uncommon among individuals with nonsubstance/medication-induced
psychotic disorders.

In addition to the four symptom domain areas identified in the
diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania
symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions
between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Psychotic disorders can occur in association with intoxication with the
following classes of substances: alcohol; cannabis; hallucinogens,
including phencyclidine and related substances; inhalants; sedatives,
hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other
(or unknown) substances. Psychotic disorders can occur in association
with withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol;
sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; and other (or unknown)
substances.

Some of the medications reported to evoke psychotic symptoms include
anesthetics and analgesics, anticholinergic agents, anticonvulsants,
antihistamines, antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications,
antimicrobial medications, antiparkinsonian medications,
chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cyclosporine, procarbazine),
corticosteroids, gastrointestinal medications, muscle relaxants,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, other over-the-counter
medications (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), antidepressant
medication, and disulfiram. Toxins reported to induce psychotic symptoms
include anticholinesterase, organophosphate insecticides, sarin and
other nerve gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and volatile
substances such as fuel or paint.

Prevalence

Prevalence of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder in the
general population is unknown. Between 7% and 25% of individuals
presenting with a first episode of psychosis in different settings are
reported to have substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p159}**114**

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Development and Course

The initiation of the disorder may vary considerably with the substance.
For example, smoking a high dose of cocaine may produce psychosis within
minutes, whereas days or weeks of high-dose alcohol or sedative use may
be required to produce psychosis. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder,
with hallucinations, usually occurs only after prolonged, heavy
ingestion of alcohol in individuals who have moderate to severe alcohol
use disorder, and the hallucinations are generally auditory in nature.

Psychotic disorders induced by amphetamine and cocaine share similar
clinical features. Persecutory delusions may rapidly develop shortly
after use of amphetamine or a similarly acting sympathomimetic. The
hallucination of bugs or vermin crawling in or under the skin
(formication) can lead to scratching and extensive skin excoriations.
Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder may develop shortly after high-dose
cannabis use and usually involves persecutory delusions, marked anxiety,
emotional lability, and depersonalization.

The disorder usually remits within a day but in some cases may persist
for a few days.

Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder may at times persist
when the offending agent is removed, such that it may be difficult
initially to distinguish it from an independent psychotic disorder.
Agents such as amphetamines, phencyclidine, and cocaine have been
reported to evoke temporary psychotic states that can sometimes persist
for weeks or longer despite removal of the agent and treatment with
neuroleptic medication. In later life, poly-pharmacy for medical
conditions and exposure to medications for parkinsonism, cardiovascular
disease, and other medical disorders may be associated with a greater
likelihood of psychosis induced by prescription medications as opposed
to substances of abuse.

Diagnostic Markers

With substances for which relevant blood levels are available (e.g.,
blood alcohol level, other quantifiable blood levels such as digoxin),
the presence of a level consistent with toxicity may increase diagnostic
certainty.

Functional Consequences of

Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder

Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is typically severely
disabling and consequently is observed most frequently in emergency
rooms, as individuals are often brought to the acute-care setting when
it occurs. However, the disability is typically self-limited and
resolves upon removal of the offending agent.

Differential Diagnosis

Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal.

Individuals intoxicated with stimulants, cannabis, the opioid
meperidine, or phencyclidine, or those withdrawing from alcohol or
sedatives, may experience altered perceptions that they recognize as
drug effects. If reality testing for these experiences remains intact
(i.e., the individual recognizes that the perception is substance
induced and neither believes in nor acts on it), the diagnosis is not
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Instead, substance
intoxication or substance withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances, is
diagnosed (e.g., cocaine intoxication, with perceptual disturbances).
"Flashback" hallucinations that can occur long after the use of
hallucinogens has stopped are diagnosed as hallucinogen persisting
perception disorder. If substance/medication-induced psychotic symptoms
occur exclusively during the course of a delirium, as in severe forms of
alcohol withdrawal, the psychotic symptoms are considered to be an
associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately.
Delusions in the context of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder
would be diagnosed as major or mild neurocognitive disorder, with
behavioral disturbance.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p160}Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical
Condition **115**

Primary psychotic disorder.

A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is

distinguished from a primary psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder,
other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, or
unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, by the
fact that a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the
symptoms.

Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition.

A substance/medication-induced

psychotic disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental or medical
condition must have its onset while the individual is receiving the
medication (or during withdrawal, if there is a withdrawal syndrome
associated with the medication). Because individuals with medical
conditions often take medications for those conditions, the clinician
must consider the possibility that the psychotic symptoms are caused by
the physiological consequences of the medical condition rather than the
medication, in which case psychotic disorder due to another medical
condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the primary basis for
such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the medical
condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may be
needed to determine empirically for that individual whether the
medication is the causative agent. If the clinician has ascertained that
the disturbance is attributable to both a medical condition and
substance/medication use, both diagnoses (i.e., psychotic disorder due
to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder) may be given.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the

severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity
in the chapter "Assessment Measures.")

**Note:** Diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical
condition can be made without using this severity specifier.

Specifiers

In addition to the symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic
criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom
domains is vital for making critically important distinctions between
the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of psychotic disorder due to another medical
condition are prominent delusions or hallucinations that are judged to
be attributable to the physiological effects of another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.,
the symptoms are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe
medical condition, in which case a diagnosis of brief psychotic
disorder, with marked stressor, would be appropriate).

Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality (i.e., visual,
olfactory, gustatory, tactile, or auditory), but certain etiological
factors are likely to evoke specific hallucinatory phenomena. Olfactory
hallucinations are suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. Hallucinations
may vary from simple and unformed to highly complex and organized,
depending on etiological and environmental factors. Psychotic disorder
due to another medical condition is generally not diagnosed if the
individual maintains reality testing for the hallucinations and
appreciates that they result from the medical condition. Delusions may
have a variety of themes, including somatic, grandiose, religious, and,
most commonly, persecutory. On the whole, however, associations between
delusions and particular medical conditions appear to be less specific
than is the case for hallucinations.

In determining whether the psychotic disturbance is attributable to
another medical condition, the presence of a medical condition must be
identified and considered to be the etiology of the psychosis through a
physiological mechanism. Although there are no infallible guidelines for
determining whether the relationship between the psychotic disturbance
and the medical condition is etiological, several considerations provide
some guidance.

One consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the
onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and that of
the psychotic disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of
features that are atypical for a psychotic disorder (e.g., atypical age
at onset or presence of visual or olfactory hallucinations). The
disturbance must also be distinguished from a
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or another mental
disorder (e.g., an adjustment disorder).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The temporal association of the onset or exacerbation of the medical
condition offers the greatest diagnostic certainty that the delusions or
hallucinations are attributable to a medical condition. Additional
factors may include concomitant treatments for the underlying medical
condition that confer a risk for psychosis independently, such as
steroid treatment for autoimmune disorders.

Prevalence

Prevalence rates for psychotic disorder due to another medical condition
are difficult to estimate given the wide variety of underlying medical
etiologies. Lifetime prevalence has

[]{#index_split_013.html#p162}Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical
Condition **117**

been estimated to range from 0.21% to 0.54%. When the prevalence
findings are stratified by age group, individuals older than 65 years
have a significantly greater prevalence of 0.74% compared with those in
younger age groups. Rates of psychosis also vary according to the
underlying medical condition; conditions most commonly associated with
psychosis include untreated endocrine and metabolic disorders,
autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus,
*N*-methylD-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoimmune encephalitis), or
temporal lobe epilepsy. Psychosis due to epilepsy has been further
differentiated into ictal, postictal, and interictal psychosis. The most
common of these is postictal psychosis, observed in 2%--7.8% of epilepsy
patients. Among older individuals, there may be a higher prevalence of
the disorder in females, although additional gender-related features are
not clear and vary considerably with the gender distributions of the
underlying medical conditions.

Development and Course

Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition may be a single
transient state or it may be recurrent, cycling with exacerbations and
remissions of the underlying medical condition. Although treatment of
the underlying medical condition often results in a resolution of the
psychosis, this is not always the case, and psychotic symptoms may
persist long after the medical event (e.g., psychotic disorder due to
focal brain injury). In the context of chronic conditions such as
multiple sclerosis or chronic interictal psychosis of epilepsy, the
psychosis may assume a long-term course.

The expression of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition
does not differ substantially in phenomenology depending on age at
occurrence. However, older age groups have a higher prevalence of the
disorder, which is most likely due to the increasing medical burden
associated with advanced age and the cumulative effects of deleterious
exposures and age-related processes (e.g., atherosclerosis). The nature
of the underlying medical conditions is likely to change across the
lifespan, with younger age groups more affected by epilepsy, head
trauma, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases of early to midlife, and
older age groups more affected by stroke disease, anoxic events, and
multiple system comorbidities. Underlying factors with increasing age,
such as preexisting cognitive impairment as well as vision and hearing
impairments, may incur a greater risk for psychosis, possibly by serving
to lower the threshold for experiencing psychosis.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Course modifiers.

Identification and treatment of the underlying medical condition has the
greatest impact on course, although preexisting central nervous system
injury may confer a worse course outcome (e.g., head trauma,
cerebrovascular disease).

Diagnostic Markers

The diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition
depends on the clinical condition of each individual, and the diagnostic
tests will vary according to that condition. A variety of medical
conditions may cause psychotic symptoms. These include neurological
conditions (e.g., neoplasms, cerebrovascular disease, Huntington\'s
disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, auditory or visual nerve injury
or impairment, deafness, migraine, central nervous system infections),
endocrine conditions (e.g., hyper-and hypothyroidism, hyper-and
hypoparathyroidism, hyper-and hypoadrenocorticism), metabolic conditions
(e.g., hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypoglycemia), fluid or electrolyte
imbalances, hepatic or renal diseases, and autoimmune disorders with
central nervous system involvement (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus).
The associated physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and
patterns of prevalence or onset reflect the etiological medical
condition.

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Suicide Risk

Suicide risk in the context of psychotic disorder due to another medical
condition is not clearly delineated, although certain conditions such as
epilepsy and multiple sclerosis are associated with increased rates of
suicide, which may be further increased in the presence of psychosis.

Functional Consequences of Psychotic Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

Functional disability is typically severe in the context of psychotic
disorder due to another medical condition but will vary considerably by
the type of condition and likely improve with successful resolution of
the condition.

Differential Diagnosis

Delirium.

Hallucinations and delusions commonly occur in the context of a
delirium; however, a separate diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to
another medical condition is not given if the disturbance occurs
exclusively during the course of a delirium. Delusions in the context of
a major or mild neurocognitive disorder would be diagnosed as major or
mild neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance.

Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.

If there is evidence of recent or

prolonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive
effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin (e.g., LSD
\[lysergic acid diethylamide\] intoxication, alcohol withdrawal), a
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be considered.
Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks) of
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be
especially indicative of a substance-induced psychotic disorder,
depending on the character, duration, or amount of the substance used.
If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a
medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., psychotic
disorder due to another medical condition and
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) can be given.

Psychotic disorder.

Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition must be
distinguished from a psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, delusional
disorder, schizoaffective disorder) or a depressive or bipolar disorder,
with psychotic features. In psychotic disorders and in depressive or
bipolar disorders, with psychotic features, no specific and direct
causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition
can be demonstrated. Late age at onset and the absence of a personal or
family history of schizophrenia or delusional disorder suggest the need
for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of psychotic
disorder due to another medical condition. Auditory hallucinations that
involve voices speaking complex sentences are more characteristic of
schizophrenia than of psychotic disorder due to a medical condition.
Other types of hallucinations (e.g., visual, olfactory) commonly signal
a psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or a
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.

Comorbidity

Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition in individuals older
than 80 years is associated with concurrent major neurocognitive
disorder (dementia).

[]{#index_split_013.html#p164}Catatonia Associated With Another Mental
Disorder (Catatonia Specifier) **119**

**Catatonia**

Catatonia can occur in the context of several disorders, including
neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive disorders, and other
medical conditions (e.g., cerebral folate deficiency, rare autoimmune
and paraneoplastic disorders. The manual does not treat catatonia as an
independent class but recognizes a) catatonia associated with another
mental disorder (i.e., a neurodevelopmental, psychotic disorder, a
bipolar disorder, a depressive disorder, or other mental disorder), b)
catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, and c) unspecified
catatonia.

Catatonia is defined by the presence of three or more of 12 psychomotor
features in the diagnostic criteria for catatonia associated with
another mental disorder and catatonic disorder due to another medical
condition. The essential feature of catatonia is a marked psychomotor
disturbance that may involve decreased motor activity, decreased
engagement during interview or physical examination, or excessive and
peculiar motor activity. The clinical presentation of catatonia can be
puzzling, as the psychomotor disturbance may range from marked
unresponsiveness to marked agitation. Motoric immobility may be severe
(stupor) or moderate (catalepsy and waxy flexibility). Similarly,
decreased engagement may be severe (mutism) or moderate (negativism).
Excessive and peculiar motor behaviors can be complex (e.g., stereotypy)
or simple (agitation) and may include echolalia and echopraxia. In
extreme cases, the same individual may wax and wane between decreased
and excessive motor activity. The seemingly opposing clinical features
and variable manifestations of the diagnosis contribute to a lack of
awareness and decreased recognition of catatonia. During severe stages
of catatonia, the individual may need careful supervision to avoid
self-harm or harming others. There are potential risks from
malnutrition, exhaustion, hyperpyrexia and self-inflicted injury.

**293.89 (F06.1)**

A. The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more) of the following
symptoms: 1. Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively
relating to environment).

2\. Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against
gravity).

3\. Waxy flexibility (i.e., slight, even resistance to positioning by
examiner).

4\. Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response \[exclude if known
aphasia\]).

5\. Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or
external stimuli).

6\. Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture
against gravity).

7\. Mannerism (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions).

8\. Stereotypy (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed
movements).

9\. Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli.

10\. Grimacing.

11\. Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another's speech).

12\. Echopraxia (i.e., mimicking another's movements).

**Coding note:** Indicate the name of the associated mental disorder
when recording the name of the condition (i.e., 293.89 \[F06.1\]
catatonia associated with major depressive disorder). Code first the
associated mental disorder (e.g., neurodevelopmental disorder, brief

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder,
or other mental disorder) (e.g., 295.70 \[F25.1\]

schizoaffective disorder, depressive type; 293.89 \[F06.1\] catatonia
associated with schizoaffective disorder).

Diagnostic Features

Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier)
may be used when criteria are met for catatonia during the course of a
neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, or other mental
disorder. The catatonia specifier is appropriate when the clinical
picture is characterized by marked psychomotor disturbance and involves
at least three of the 12 diagnostic features listed in Criterion A.
Catatonia is typically diagnosed in an inpatient setting and occurs in
up to 35% of individuals with schizophrenia, but the majority of
catatonia cases involve individuals with depressive or bipolar
disorders. Before the catatonia specifier is used in neurodevelopmental,
psychotic, bipolar, depressive, or other mental disorders, a wide
variety of other medical conditions need to be ruled out; these
conditions include, but are not limited to, medical conditions due to
infectious, metabolic, or neurological conditions (see "Catatonic
Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"). Catatonia can also be a
side effect of a medication (see the chapter "Medication-Induced
Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication"). Because of
the seriousness of the complications, particular attention should be
paid to the possibility that the catatonia is attributable to 333.92
(G21.0) neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., a manic episode).

delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

[]{#index_split_013.html#p166}Unspecified Catatonia

**121**

**Coding note:** Include the name of the medical condition in the name
of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.89 \[F06.1\]) catatonic disorder due
to hepatic encephalopathy). The other medical condition should be coded
and listed separately immediately before the catatonic disorder due to
the medical condition (e.g., 572.2 \[K71.90\] hepatic encephalopathy;
293.89 \[F06.1\] catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy).

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of catatonic disorder due to another medical
condition is the presence of catatonia that is judged to be attributed
to the physiological effects of another medical condition. Catatonia can
be diagnosed by the presence of at least three of the 12 clinical
features in Criterion A. There must be evidence from the history,
physical examination, or laboratory findings that the catatonia is
attributable to another medical condition (Criterion B). The diagnosis
is not given if the catatonia is better explained by another mental
disorder (e.g., manic episode) (Criterion C) or if it occurs exclusively
during the course of a delirium (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A variety of medical conditions may cause catatonia, especially
neurological conditions (e.g., neoplasms, head trauma, cerebrovascular
disease, encephalitis) and metabolic conditions (e.g., hypercalcemia,
hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, diabetic ketoacidosis). The
associated physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and
patterns of prevalence and onset reflect those of the etiological
medical condition.

Differential Diagnosis

A separate diagnosis of catatonic disorder due to another medical
condition is not given if the catatonia occurs exclusively during the
course of a delirium or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. If the
individual is currently taking neuroleptic medication, consideration
should be given to medication-induced movement disorders (e.g., abnormal
positioning may be due to neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia) or
neuroleptic malignant syndrome (e.g., catatonic-like features may be
present, along with associated vital sign and/or laboratory
abnormalities). Catatonic symptoms may be present in any of the
following five psychotic disorders: brief psychotic disorder,
schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. It may also be present
in some of the neurodevelopmental disorders, in all of the bipolar and
depressive disorders, and in other mental disorders.

Unspecified Catatonia

 

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of catatonia cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning but either
the nature of the underlying mental disorder or other medical condition
is unclear, full criteria for catatonia are not met, or there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and

Other Psychotic Disorder

**298.8 (F28)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The other specified
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. This is done by
recording "other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "persistent auditory
hallucinations").

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following:

1\. **Persistent auditory hallucinations** occurring in the absence of
any other features.

2\. **Delusions with significant overlapping mood episodes:** This
includes persistent delusions with periods of overlapping mood episodes
that are present for a substantial portion of the delusional disturbance
(such that the criterion stipulating only brief mood disturbance in
delusional disorder is not met).

3\. **Attenuated psychosis syndrome:** This syndrome is characterized by
psychotic-like symptoms that are below a threshold for full psychosis
(e.g., the symptoms are less severe and more transient, and insight is
relatively maintained).

4\. **Delusional symptoms in partner of individual with delusional
disorder:** In the context of a relationship, the delusional material
from the dominant partner provides content for delusional belief by the
individual who may not otherwise entirely meet criteria for delusional
disorder.

Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and

Other Psychotic Disorder

**298.9 (F29)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason
that the criteria are not met for a specific schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorder, and includes presentations in which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

[]{#index_split_013.html#p168}**Bipolar and**

**Related Disorders**

Bipolar and related disorders are separated from the depressive
disorders in DSM-5 and placed between the chapters on schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorders and depressive disorders in
recognition of their place as a bridge between the two diagnostic
classes in terms of symptomatology, family history, and genetics. The
diagnoses included in this chapter are bipolar I disorder, bipolar II
disorder, cyclothymic disorder, substance/medication-induced bipolar and
related disorder, bipolar and related disorder due to another medical
condition, other specified bipolar and related disorder, and unspecified
bipolar and related disorder.

The bipolar I disorder criteria represent the modern understanding of
the classic manic-depressive disorder or affective psychosis described
in the nineteenth century, differing from that classic description only
to the extent that neither psychosis nor the lifetime experience of a
major depressive episode is a requirement. However, the vast majority of
individuals whose symptoms meet the criteria for a fully syndromal manic
episode also experience major depressive episodes during the course of
their lives.

Bipolar II disorder, requiring the lifetime experience of at least one
episode of major depression and at least one hypomanic episode, is no
longer thought to be a "milder" condition than bipolar I disorder,
largely because of the amount of time individuals with this condition
spend in depression and because the instability of mood experienced by
individuals with bipolar II disorder is typically accompanied by serious
impairment in work and social functioning.

The diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is given to adults who experience
at least 2 years (for children, a full year) of both hypomanic and
depressive periods without ever fulfilling the criteria for an episode
of mania, hypomania, or major depression.

A large number of substances of abuse, some prescribed medications, and
several medical conditions can be associated with manic-like phenomena.
This fact is recognized in the diagnoses of substance/medication-induced
bipolar and related disorder and bipolar and related disorder due to
another medical condition.

The recognition that many individuals, particularly children and, to a
lesser extent, adolescents, experience bipolar-like phenomena that do
not meet the criteria for bipolar I, bipolar II, or cyclothymic disorder
is reflected in the availability of the other specified bipolar and
related disorder category. Indeed, specific criteria for a disorder
involving short-duration hypomania are provided in Section III in the
hope of encouraging further study of this disorder.

Bipolar I Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

For a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the
following criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have been
preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive
episodes.

**123**

[]{#index_split_013.html#p169}**124**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

**Manic Episode**

A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive,
or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased
goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present
most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is
necessary).

B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or
activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is
only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a
noticeable change from usual behavior: 1. Inflated self-esteem or
grandiosity.

2\. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of
sleep).

3\. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.

4\. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.

5\. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or
irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.

6\. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or
school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless
non-goal-directed activity).

7\. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for
painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees,
sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).

C. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked
impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate
hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are
psychotic features.

D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to
another medical condition.

**Note:** A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant
treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at
a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that
treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a
bipolar I diagnosis.

**Note:** Criteria A--D constitute a manic episode. At least one
lifetime manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I
disorder.

**Hypomanic Episode**

A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive,
or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or
energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day,
nearly every day.

B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and
activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is
only irritable) have persisted, represent a noticeable change from usual
behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:

1\. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.

2\. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of
sleep).

3\. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.

4\. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.

5\. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or
irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.

6\. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or
school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.

7\. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for
painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees,
sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).

[]{#index_split_013.html#p170}Bipolar I Disorder

**125**

C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning
that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.

D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable
by others.

E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social
or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there
are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic.

F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment).

**Note:** A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant
treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at
a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that
treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis.
However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly
increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant
use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode,
nor necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis.

**Note:** Criteria A--F constitute a hypomanic episode. Hypomanic
episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the
diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

**Major Depressive Episode**

A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the
same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at
least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of
interest or pleasure.

**Note:** Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to
another medical condition.

1\. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by
either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or
observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (**Note:** In
children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly diminished
interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day,
nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or
observation).

3\. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a
change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or
increase in appetite nearly every day. (**Note:** In children, consider
failure to make expected weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly
every day.

5\. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by
others; not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed
down).

6\. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.

7\. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which
may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt
about being sick).

8\. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness,
nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by
others).

9\. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent
suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a
specific plan for committing suicide.

B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or another medical condition.

**Note:** Criteria A--C constitute a major depressive episode. Major
depressive episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not
required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

**Note:** Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial
ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or
disability) may include the feelings of intense

[]{#index_split_013.html#p171}**126**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight
loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode.
Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate
to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to
the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully
considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical
judgment based on the individual's history and the cultural norms for
the expression of distress in the context of loss.1

**Bipolar I Disorder**

A. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode (Criteria A--D
under "Manic Episode" above).

B. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not
better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,
schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or
unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.

**Coding and Recording Procedures**

The diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current
or most recent episode and its status with respect to current severity,
presence of psychotic features, and remission status. Current severity
and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently
met for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are
only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a manic,
hypomanic, or major depressive episode. Codes are as follows: Current or

1 In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is
useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of
emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent depressed mood and the
inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is
likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves,
the so-called pangs of grief. These waves tend to be associated with
thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The depressed mood of a MDE is
more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.

The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that
are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery
characteristic of a major depressive episode. The thought content
associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts
and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or
pessimistic ruminations seen in a MDE.

In grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in a MDE, feelings
of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory
ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings
vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not
telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved
individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally
focused on the deceased and possibly about "joining" the deceased,
whereas in a major depressive episode such thoughts are focused on
ending one's own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life,
or unable to cope with the pain of depression.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of a manic episode is a distinct period during
which there is an abnormally, persistently elevated, expansive, or
irritable mood and persistently increased activity or energy that is
present for most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of at least
1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary), accompanied by
at least three additional symptoms from Criterion B. If the mood is
irritable rather than elevated or expansive, at least four Criterion B
symptoms must be present.

Mood in a manic episode is often described as euphoric, excessively
cheerful, high, or

"feeling on top of the world." In some cases, the mood is of such a
highly infectious quality that it is easily recognized as excessive and
may be characterized by unlimited and hap-hazard enthusiasm for
interpersonal, sexual, or occupational interactions. For example, the
individual may spontaneously start extensive conversations with
strangers in public.

Often the predominant mood is irritable rather than elevated,
particularly when the individual's wishes are denied or if the
individual has been using substances. Rapid shifts in mood over brief
periods of time may occur and are referred to as lability (i.e., the
alterna-

[]{#index_split_024.html#p173}**128**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

tion among euphoria, dysphoria, and irritability). In children,
happiness, silliness and

"goofiness" are normal in the context of special occasions; however, if
these symptoms are recurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond
what is expected for the developmental level of the child, they may meet
Criterion A. If the happiness is unusual for a child (i.e., distinct
from baseline), and the mood change occurs at the same time as symptoms
that meet Criterion B for mania, diagnostic certainty is increased;
however, the mood change must be accompanied by persistently increased
activity or energy levels that are obvious to those who know the child
well.

During the manic episode, the individual may engage in multiple
overlapping new projects. The projects are often initiated with little
knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems out of the individual's reach.
The increased activity levels may manifest at unusual hours of the day.

Inflated self-esteem is typically present, ranging from uncritical
self-confidence to marked grandiosity, and may reach delusional
proportions (Criterion B1). Despite lack of any particular experience or
talent, the individual may embark on complex tasks such as writing a
novel or seeking publicity for some impractical invention. Grandiose
delusions (e.g., of having a special relationship to a famous person)
are common. In children, overestimation of abilities and belief that,
for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class
is normal; however, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence
to the contrary or the child attempts feats that are clearly dangerous
and, most important, represent a change from the child's normal
behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied.

One of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion
B2) and is distinct from insomnia in which the individual wants to sleep
or feels the need to sleep but is unable. The individual may sleep
little, if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than usual,
feeling rested and full of energy. When the sleep disturbance is severe,
the individual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel tired. Often
a decreased need for sleep heralds the onset of a manic episode.

Speech can be rapid, pressured, loud, and difficult to interrupt
(Criterion B3). Individuals may talk continuously and without regard for
others' wishes to communicate, often in an intrusive manner or without
concern for the relevance of what is said. Speech is sometimes
characterized by jokes, puns, amusing irrelevancies, and theatricality,
with dramatic mannerisms, singing, and excessive gesturing. Loudness and
forcefulness of speech often become more important than what is
conveyed. If the individual's mood is more irritable than expansive,
speech may be marked by complaints, hostile comments, or angry tirades,
particularly if attempts are made to interrupt the individual. Both
Criterion A and Criterion B symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of
the opposite (i.e., depressive) pole (see "with mixed features"
specifier, pp. 149--150).

Often the individual's thoughts race at a rate faster than they can be
expressed through speech (Criterion B4). Frequently there is flight of
ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow of accelerated speech, with
abrupt shifts from one topic to another. When flight of ideas is severe,
speech may become disorganized, incoherent, and particularly distressful
to the individual. Sometimes thoughts are experienced as so crowded that
it is very difficult to speak.

Distractibility (Criterion B5) is evidenced by an inability to censor
immaterial external stimuli (e.g., the interviewer's attire, background
noises or conversations, furnishings in the room) and often prevents
individuals experiencing mania from holding a rational conversation or
attending to instructions.

The increase in goal-directed activity often consists of excessive
planning and participation in multiple activities, including sexual,
occupational, political, or religious activities. Increased sexual
drive, fantasies, and behavior are often present. Individuals in a manic
episode usually show increased sociability (e.g., renewing old
acquaintances or calling or contacting friends or even strangers),
without regard to the intrusive, domineering, and demanding nature of
these interactions. They often display psychomotor agitation or
restlessness (i.e., purposeless activity) by pacing or by holding
multiple conversations simulta-

neously. Some individuals write excessive letters, e-mails, text
messages, and so forth, on many different topics to friends, public
figures, or the media.

The increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in
children; however, when the child takes on many tasks simultaneously,
starts devising elaborate and unrealistic plans for projects, develops
previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual
preoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to
sexually explicit material), then Criterion B might be met based on
clinical judgment. It is essential to determine whether the behavior
represents a change from the child's baseline behavior; occurs most of
the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in
temporal association with other symptoms of mania.

The expansive mood, excessive optimism, grandiosity, and poor judgment
often lead to reckless involvement in activities such as spending
sprees, giving away possessions, reckless driving, foolish business
investments, and sexual promiscuity that is unusual for the individual,
even though these activities are likely to have catastrophic
consequences (Criterion B7). The individual may purchase many unneeded
items without the money to pay for them and, in some cases, give them
away. Sexual behavior may include infidelity or indiscriminate sexual
encounters with strangers, often disregarding the risk of sexually
transmitted diseases or interpersonal consequences.

The manic episode must result in marked impairment in social or
occupational functioning or require hospitalization to prevent harm to
self or others (e.g., financial losses, illegal activities, loss of
employment, self-injurious behavior). By definition, the presence of
psychotic features during a manic episode also satisfies Criterion C.

Manic symptoms or syndromes that are attributable to the physiological
effects of a drug of abuse (e.g., in the context of cocaine or
amphetamine intoxication), the side effects of medications or treatments
(e.g., steroids, L-dopa, antidepressants, stimulants), or another
medical condition do not count toward the diagnosis of bipolar I
disorder. However, a fully syndromal manic episode that arises during
treatment (e.g., with medications, electroconvulsive therapy, light
therapy) or drug use and persists beyond the physiological effect of the
inducing agent (i.e., after a medication is fully out of the
individual's system or the effects of electroconvulsive therapy would be
expected to have dissipated completely) is sufficient evidence for a
manic episode diagnosis (Criterion D). Caution is indicated so that one
or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or
agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for
diagnosis of a manic or hypomanic episode, nor necessarily an indication
of a bipolar disorder diathesis. It is necessary to meet criteria for a
manic episode to make a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, but it is not
required to have hypomanic or major depressive episodes. However, they
may precede or follow a manic episode. Full descriptions of the
diagnostic features of a hypomanic episode may be found within the text
for bipolar II disorder, and the features of a major depressive episode
are described within the text for major depressive disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

During a manic episode, individuals often do not perceive that they are
ill or in need of treatment and vehemently resist efforts to be treated.
Individuals may change their dress, makeup, or personal appearance to a
more sexually suggestive or flamboyant style. Some perceive a sharper
sense of smell, hearing, or vision. Gambling and antisocial behaviors
may accompany the manic episode. Some individuals may become hostile and
physically threatening to others and, when delusional, may become
physically assaultive or suicidal. Catastrophic consequences of a manic
episode (e.g., involuntary hospitalization, difficulties with the law,
serious financial difficulties) often result from poor judgment, loss of
insight, and hyperactivity.

Mood may shift very rapidly to anger or depression. Depressive symptoms
may occur during a manic episode and, if present, may last moments,
hours, or, more rarely, days (see

"with mixed features" specifier, pp. 149--150).

Bipolar and Related Disorders

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalence estimate in the continental United States was
0.6% for bipolar I disorder as defined in DSM-IV. Twelve-month
prevalence of bipolar I disorder across 11

countries ranged from 0.0% to 0.6%. The lifetime male-to-female
prevalence ratio is approximately 1.1:1.

Development and Course

Mean age at onset of the first manic, hypomanic, or major depressive
episode is approximately 18 years for bipolar I disorder. Special
considerations are necessary to detect the diagnosis in children. Since
children of the same chronological age may be at different developmental
stages, it is difficult to define with precision what is "normal" or
"expected" at any given point. Therefore, each child should be judged
according to his or her own baseline. Onset occurs throughout the life
cycle, including first onsets in the 60s or 70s. Onset of manic symptoms
(e.g., sexual or social disinhibition) in late midlife or late-life
should prompt consideration of medical conditions (e.g., frontotemporal
neurocognitive disorder) and of substance ingestion or withdrawal.

More than 90% of individuals who have a single manic episode go on to
have recurrent mood episodes. Approximately 60% of manic episodes occur
immediately before a major depressive episode. Individuals with bipolar
I disorder who have multiple (four or more) mood episodes (major
depressive, manic, or hypomanic) within 1 year receive the specifier
"with rapid cycling."

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental. Bipolar disorder is more common in high-income than in
low-income countries (1.4 vs. 0.7%). Separated, divorced, or widowed
individuals have higher rates of bipolar I disorder than do individuals
who are married or have never been married, but the direction of the
association is unclear.

Genetic and physiological. A family history of bipolar disorder is one
of the strongest and most consistent risk factors for bipolar disorders.
There is an average 10-fold increased risk among adult relatives of
individuals with bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. Magnitude of risk
increases with degree of kinship. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
likely share a genetic origin, reflected in familial co-aggregation of
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Course modifiers. After an individual has a manic episode with psychotic
features, subsequent manic episodes are more likely to include psychotic
features. Incomplete inter-episode recovery is more common when the
current episode is accompanied by mood-incongruent psychotic features.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Little information exists on specific cultural differences in the
expression of bipolar I disorder. One possible explanation for this may
be that diagnostic instruments are often translated and applied in
different cultures with no transcultural validation. In one U.S.

study, 12-month prevalence of bipolar I disorder was significantly lower
for Afro-Caribbeans than for African Americans or whites.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Females are more likely to experience rapid cycling and mixed states,
and to have patterns of comorbidity that differ from those of males,
including higher rates of lifetime eating disorders. Females with
bipolar I or II disorder are more likely to experience depressive
symptoms than males. They also have a higher lifetime risk of alcohol
use disorder than are males and a much greater likelihood of alcohol use
disorder than do females in the general population.

[]{#index_split_024.html#p176}Bipolar I Disorder

**131**

Suicide Risk

The lifetime risk of suicide in individuals with bipolar disorder is
estimated to be at least 15 times that of the general population. In
fact, bipolar disorder may account for one-quarter of all completed
suicides. A past history of suicide attempt and percent days spent
depressed in the past year are associated with greater risk of suicide
attempts or completions.

Functional Consequences of Bipolar I Disorder

Although many individuals with bipolar disorder return to a fully
functional level between episodes, approximately 30% show severe
impairment in work role function. Functional recovery lags substantially
behind recovery from symptoms, especially with respect to occupational
recovery, resulting in lower socioeconomic status despite equivalent
levels of education when compared with the general population.
Individuals with bipolar I disorder perform more poorly than healthy
individuals on cognitive tests. Cognitive impairments may contribute to
vocational and interpersonal difficulties and persist through the
lifespan, even during euthymic periods.

Differential Diagnosis

Major depressive disorder.

Major depressive disorder may also be accompanied by hypomanic or manic
symptoms (i.e., fewer symptoms or for a shorter duration than required
for mania or hypomania). When the individual presents in an episode of
major depression, one must depend on corroborating history regarding
past episodes of mania or hypomania. Symptoms of irritability may be
associated with either major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder,
adding to diagnostic complexity.

Other bipolar disorders.

Diagnosis of bipolar I disorder is differentiated from bipolar II
disorder by determining whether there have been any past episodes of
mania. Other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders
should be differentiated from bipolar I and II disorders by considering
whether either the episodes involving manic or hypomanic symptoms or the
episodes of depressive symptoms fail to meet the full criteria for those
conditions.

Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition may be distinguished
from bipolar I and II disorders by identifying, based on best clinical
evidence, a causally related medical condition.

Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress
disorder, or other anxiety disorders.

These disorders need to be considered in the differential diagnosis as
either the primary disorder or, in some cases, a comorbid disorder. A
careful history of symptoms is needed to differentiate generalized
anxiety disorder from bipolar disorder, as anxious ruminations may be
mistaken for racing thoughts, and efforts to minimize anxious feelings
may be taken as impulsive behavior. Similarly, symptoms of posttraumatic
stress disorder need to be differentiated from bipolar disorder. It is
helpful to assess the episodic nature of the symptoms described, as well
as to consider symptom triggers, in making this differential diagnosis.

Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder.

Substance use disorders may manifest with substance.medication-induced
manic symptoms that must be distinguished from bipolar I disorder;
response to mood stabilizers during a substance/medication-induced mania
may not necessarily be diagnostic for bipolar disorder. There may be
substantial overlap in view of the tendency for individuals with bipolar
I disorder to overuse substances during an episode. A primary diagnosis
of bipolar disorder must be established based on symptoms that remain
once substances are no longer being used.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

This disorder may be misdiagnosed as bipolar

disorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many symptoms overlap
with the symp-

[]{#index_split_024.html#p177}**132**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

toms of mania, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility,
and less need for sleep. The "double counting" of symptoms toward both
ADHD and bipolar disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies
whether the symptom(s) represents a distinct episode.

Personality disorders.

Personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder may have
substantial symptomatic overlap with bipolar disorders, since mood
lability and impulsivity are common in both conditions. Symptoms must
represent a distinct episode, and the noticeable increase over baseline
required for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder must be present. A
diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be made during an
untreated mood episode.

Disorders with prominent irritability.

In individuals with severe irritability, particularly children and
adolescents, care must be taken to apply the diagnosis of bipolar
disorder only to those who have had a clear episode of mania or
hypomania---that is, a distinct time period, of the required duration,
during which the irritability was clearly different from the
individual's baseline and was accompanied by the onset of Criterion B
symptoms.

When a child's irritability is persistent and particularly severe, the
diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder would be more
appropriate. Indeed, when any child is being assessed for mania, it is
essential that the symptoms represent a clear change from the child's
typical behavior.

Comorbidity

Co-occurring mental disorders are common, with the most frequent
disorders being any anxiety disorder (e.g., panic attacks, social
anxiety disorder \[social phobia\], specific phobia), occurring in
approximately three-fourths of individuals; ADHD, any disruptive,
impulse-control, or conduct disorder (e.g., intermittent explosive
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder), and any
substance use disorder (e.g., alcohol use disorder) occur in over half
of individuals with bipolar I disorder. Adults with bipolar I disorder
have high rates of serious and/or untreated co-occurring medical
conditions.

Metabolic syndrome and migraine are more common among individuals with
bipolar disorder than in the general population. More than half of
individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for bipolar disorder have an
alcohol use disorder, and those with both disorders are at greater risk
for suicide attempt.

Bipolar II Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**296.89 (F31.81)**

For a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, it is necessary to meet the
following criteria for a current or past hypomanic episode *and* the
following criteria for a current or past major depressive episode:

**Hypomanic Episode**

A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive,
or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or
energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day,
nearly every day.

B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and
activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted (four
if the mood is only irritable), represent a noticeable change from usual
behavior, and have been present to a significant degree: 1. Inflated
self-esteem or grandiosity.

2\. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of
sleep).

3\. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.

[]{#index_split_024.html#p178}Bipolar II Disorder

**133**

4\. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.

5\. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or
irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.

6\. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or
school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.

7\. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for
painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees,
sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).

C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning
that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.

D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable
by others.

E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social
or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there
are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic.

F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).

**Note:** A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant
treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at
a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that
treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis.
However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly
increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant
use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode,
nor necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis.

**Major Depressive Episode**

A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the
same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at
least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of
interest or pleasure.

**Note:** Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to a
medical condition.

1\. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by
either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or
observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (**Note:** In
children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly diminished
interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day,
nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or
observation).

3\. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a
change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or
increase in appetite nearly every day. (**Note:** In children, consider
failure to make expected weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly
every day.

5\. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by
others; not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed
down).

6\. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.

7\. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which
may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt
about being sick).

8\. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness,
nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by
others).

9\. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent
suicidal ideation without a specific plan, a suicide attempt, or a
specific plan for committing suicide.

B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or another medical condition.

[]{#index_split_024.html#p179}**134**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

**Note:** Criteria A--C above constitute a major depressive episode.

**Note:** Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial
ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or
disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination
about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in
Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such
symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss,
the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal
response to a significant loss should be carefully considered. This
decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on
the individual's history and the cultural norms for the expression of
distress in the context of loss.1

**Bipolar II Disorder**

A. Criteria have been met for at least one hypomanic episode (Criteria
A--F under "Hypomanic Episode" above) and at least one major depressive
episode (Criteria A--C under

"Major Depressive Episode" above).

B. There has never been a manic episode.

C. The occurrence of the hypomanic episode(s) and major depressive
episode(s) is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder,
schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other
specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorder.

D. The symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent
alternation between periods of depression and hypomania causes
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding and Recording Procedures**

Bipolar II disorder has one diagnostic code: 296.89 (F31.81). Its status
with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features,
course, and other specifiers cannot be coded but should be indicated in
writing (e.g., 296.89 \[F31.81\] bipolar II disorder, current episode
depressed, moderate severity, with mixed features; 296.89 \[F31.81\]
bipolar II disorder, most recent episode depressed, in partial
remission).

*Specify* current or most recent episode:

**Hypomanic**

**Depressed**

*Specify* if:

**With anxious distress** (p. 149)

**With mixed features** (pp. 149--150)

1 In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is
useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of
emptiness and loss, while in a MDE it is persistent depressed mood and
the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in
grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs
in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These waves tend to be
associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The depressed
mood of a MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or
preoccupations. The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive
emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive
unhappiness and misery characteristic of a MDE. The thought content
associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts
and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or
pessimistic ruminations seen in a MDE. In grief, self-esteem is
generally preserved, whereas in a MDE feelings of worthlessness and
self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in
grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased
(e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much
he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and
dying, such thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly
about "\'joining" the deceased, whereas in a MDE such thoughts are
focused on ending one's own life because of feeling worthless,
undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.

Diagnostic Features

Bipolar II disorder is characterized by a clinical course of recurring
mood episodes consisting of one or more major depressive episodes
(Criteria A--C under "Major Depressive Episode") and at least one
hypomanic episode (Criteria A--F under "Hypomanic Episode"). The major
depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks, and the hypomanic episode
must last at least 4 days, to meet the diagnostic criteria. During the
mood episode(s), the requisite number of symptoms must be present most
of the day, nearly every day, and represent a noticeable change from
usual behavior and functioning. The presence of a manic episode during
the course of illness precludes the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder
(Criterion B under "Bipolar II Disorder"). Episodes of
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder or
substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (representing
the physiological effects of a medication, other somatic treatments for
depression, drugs of abuse, or toxin exposure) or of depressive and
related disorder due to another medical condition or bipolar and related
disorder due to another medical condition do not count toward a
diagnosis of bipolar II disorder unless they persist beyond the
physiological effects of the treatment or substance and then meet
duration criteria for an episode. In addition, the episodes must not be
better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are not
superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional
disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or
other psychotic disorders (Criterion C under "Bipolar II Disorder"). The
depressive episodes or hypomanic fluctuations must cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning (Criterion D under "Bipolar II
Disorder"); however, for hypomanic episodes, this requirement does not
have to be met. A hypomanic episode that causes significant impairment
would likely qualify for the diagnosis of manic episode and, therefore,
for a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The recurrent major
depressive episodes are often more frequent and lengthier than those
occurring in bipolar I disorder.

Individuals with bipolar II disorder typically present to a clinician
during a major depressive episode and are unlikely to complain initially
of hypomania. Typically, the hypomanic episodes themselves do not cause
impairment. Instead, the impairment results from the major depressive
episodes or from a persistent pattern of unpredictable mood changes and
fluctuating, unreliable interpersonal or occupational functioning.
Individuals with bipolar II disorder may not view the hypomanic episodes
as pathological or disadvantageous, although others may be troubled by
the individual's erratic behavior.

Clinical information from other informants, such as close friends or
relatives, is often useful in establishing the diagnosis of bipolar II
disorder.

[]{#index_split_024.html#p181}**136**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

A hypomanic episode should not be confused with the several days of
euthymia and restored energy or activity that may follow remission of a
major depressive episode. Despite the substantial differences in
duration and severity between a manic and hypomanic episode, bipolar II
disorder is not a "milder form" of bipolar I disorder. Compared with
individuals with bipolar I disorder, individuals with bipolar II
disorder have greater chronicity of illness and spend, on average, more
time in the depressive phase of their illness, which can be severe and/

or disabling. Depressive symptoms co-occurring with a hypomanic episode
or hypomanic symptoms co-occurring with a depressive episode are common
in individuals with bipolar II disorder and are overrepresented in
females, particularly hypomania with mixed features. Individuals
experiencing hypomania with mixed features may not label their symptoms
as hypomania, but instead experience them as depression with increased
energy or irritability.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A common feature of bipolar II disorder is impulsivity, which can
contribute to suicide attempts and substance use disorders. Impulsivity
may also stem from a concurrent personality disorder, substance use
disorder, anxiety disorder, another mental disorder, or a medical
condition. There may be heightened levels of creativity in some
individuals with a bipolar disorder. However, that relationship may be
nonlinear; that is, greater lifetime creative accomplishments have been
associated with milder forms of bipolar disorder, and higher creativity
has been found in unaffected family members. The individual's attachment
to heightened creativity during hypomanic episodes may contribute to
ambivalence about seeking treatment or undermine adherence to treatment.

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalence of bipolar II disorder, internationally, is
0.3%. In the United States, 12-month prevalence is 0.8%. The prevalence
rate of pediatric bipolar II disorder is difficult to establish. DSM-IV
bipolar I, bipolar II, and bipolar disorder not otherwise specified
yield a combined prevalence rate of 1.8% in U.S. and non-U.S. community
samples, with higher rates (2.7% inclusive) in youths age 12 years or
older.

Development and Course

Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and
throughout adulthood, average age at onset is the mid-20s, which is
slightly later than for bipolar I disorder but earlier than for major
depressive disorder. The illness most often begins with a depressive
episode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanic
episode occurs; this happens in about 12% of individuals with the
initial diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Anxiety, substance use,
or eating disorders may also precede the diagnosis, complicating its
detection. Many individuals experience several episodes of major
depression prior to the first recognized hypomanic episode.

The number of lifetime episodes (both hypomanic and major depressive
episodes) tends to be higher for bipolar II disorder than for major
depressive disorder or bipolar I disorder. However, individuals with
bipolar I disorder are actually more likely to experience hypomanic
symptoms than are individuals with bipolar II disorder.The interval
between mood episodes in the course of bipolar II disorder tends to
decrease as the individual ages. While the hypomanic episode is the
feature that defines bipolar II disorder, depressive episodes are more
enduring and disabling over time. Despite the predominance of
depression, once a hypomanic episode has occurred, the diagnosis becomes
bipolar II disorder and never reverts to major depressive disorder.

Approximately 5%--15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have
multiple (four or more) mood episodes (hypomanic or major depressive)
within the previous 12 months. If

[]{#index_split_024.html#p182}Bipolar II Disorder

**137**

this pattern is present, it is noted by the specifier "with rapid
cycling." By definition, psychotic symptoms do not occur in hypomanic
episodes, and they appear to be less frequent in the major depressive
episodes in bipolar II disorder than in those of bipolar I disorder.

Switching from a depressive episode to a manic or hypomanic episode
(with or without mixed features) may occur, both spontaneously and
during treatment for depression.

About 5%--15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder will ultimately
develop a manic episode, which changes the diagnosis to bipolar I
disorder, regardless of subsequent course.

Making the diagnosis in children is often a challenge, especially in
those with irritability and hyperarousal that is *nonepisodic* (i.e.,
lacks the well-demarcated periods of altered mood). Nonepisodic
irritability in youth is associated with an elevated risk for anxiety
disorders and major depressive disorder, but not bipolar disorder, in
adulthood. Persistently irritable youths have lower familial rates of
bipolar disorder than do youths who have bipolar disorder. For a
hypomanic episode to be diagnosed, the child's symptoms must exceed what
is expected in a given environment and culture for the child's
developmental stage. Compared with adult onset of bipolar II disorder,
childhood or adolescent onset of the disorder may be associated with a
more severe lifetime course. The 3-year incidence rate of first-onset
bipolar II disorder in adults older than 60 years is 0.34%. However,
distinguishing individuals older than 60 years with bipolar II disorder
by late versus early age at onset does not appear to have any clinical
utility.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

The risk of bipolar II disorder tends to be highest among relatives of
individuals with bipolar II disorder, as opposed to individuals with
bipolar I disorder or major depressive disorder. There may be genetic
factors influencing the age at onset for bipolar disorders.

Course modifiers.

A rapid-cycling pattern is associated with a poorer prognosis. Return to
previous level of social function for individuals with bipolar II
disorder is more likely for individuals of younger age and with less
severe depression, suggesting adverse effects of prolonged illness on
recovery. More education, fewer years of illness, and being married are
independently associated with functional recovery in individuals with
bipolar disorder, even after diagnostic type (I vs. II), current
depressive symptoms, and presence of psychiatric comorbidity are taken
into account.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Whereas the gender ratio for bipolar I disorder is equal, findings on
gender differences in bipolar II disorder are mixed, differing by type
of sample (i.e., registry, community, or clinical) and country of
origin. There is little to no evidence of bipolar gender differences,
whereas some, but not all, clinical samples suggest that bipolar II
disorder is more common in females than in males, which may reflect
gender differences in treatment seeking or other factors.

Patterns of illness and comorbidity, however, seem to differ by gender,
with females being more likely than males to report hypomania with mixed
depressive features and a rapid-cycling course. Childbirth may be a
specific trigger for a hypomanic episode, which can occur in 10%--20% of
females in nonclinical populations and most typically in the early
postpartum period. Distinguishing hypomania from the elated mood and
reduced sleep that normally accompany the birth of a child may be
challenging. Postpartum hypomania may foreshadow the onset of a
depression that occurs in about half of females who experience
postpartum "highs." Accurate detection of bipolar II disorder may help
in establishing appropriate treatment of the depression, which may
reduce the risk of suicide and infanticide.

[]{#index_split_024.html#p183}**138**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

Suicide Risk

Suicide risk is high in bipolar II disorder. Approximately one-third of
individuals with bipolar II disorder report a lifetime history of
suicide attempt. The prevalence rates of lifetime attempted suicide in
bipolar II and bipolar I disorder appear to be similar (32.4% and 36.3%,
respectively). However, the lethality of attempts, as defined by a lower
ratio of attempts to completed suicides, may be higher in individuals
with bipolar II disorder compared with individuals with bipolar I
disorder. There may be an association between genetic markers and
increased risk for suicidal behavior in individuals with bipolar
disorder, including a 6.5-fold higher risk of suicide among first-degree
relatives of bipolar II probands compared with those with bipolar I
disorder.

Functional Consequences of Bipolar II Disorder

Although many individuals with bipolar II disorder return to a fully
functional level between mood episodes, at least 15% continue to have
some inter-episode dysfunction, and 20% transition directly into another
mood episode without inter-episode recovery. Functional recovery lags
substantially behind recovery from symptoms of bipolar II disorder,
especially in regard to occupational recovery, resulting in lower
socioeconomic status despite equivalent levels of education with the
general population. Individuals with bipolar II disorder perform more
poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive tests and, with the
exception of memory and semantic fluency, have similar cognitive
impairment as do individuals with bipolar I disorder. Cognitive
impairments associated with bipolar II disorder may contribute to
vocational difficulties. Prolonged unemployment in individuals with
bipolar disorder is associated with more episodes of depression, older
age, increased rates of current panic disorder, and lifetime history of
alcohol use disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Major depressive disorder.

Perhaps the most challenging differential diagnosis to consider is major
depressive disorder, which may be accompanied by hypomanic or manic
symptoms that do not meet full criteria (i.e., either fewer symptoms or
a shorter duration than required for a hypomanic episode). This is
especially true in evaluating individuals with symptoms of irritability,
which may be associated with either major depressive disorder or bipolar
II disorder.

Cyclothymic disorder.

In cyclothymic disorder, there are numerous periods of hypomanic
symptoms and numerous periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet
symptom or duration criteria for a major depressive episode. Bipolar II
disorder is distinguished from cyclothymic disorder by the presence of
one or more major depressive episodes. If a major depressive episode
occurs after the first 2 years of cyclothymic disorder, the additional
diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is given.

Schizophrenia spectrum and other related psychotic disorders.

Bipolar II disorder must

be distinguished from psychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective
disorder, schizophrenia, and delusional disorder). Schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorder, and delusional disorder are all characterized
by periods of psychotic symptoms that occur in the absence of prominent
mood symptoms. Other helpful considerations include the accompanying
symptoms, previous course, and family history.

Panic disorder or other anxiety disorders.

Anxiety disorders need to be considered in

the differential diagnosis and may frequently be present as co-occurring
disorders.

Substance use disorders.

Substance use disorders are included in the differential diagnosis.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

may be misdiagnosed as bipolar II disorder, especially in adolescents
and children. Many

[]{#index_split_024.html#p184}Cyclothymic Disorder

**139**

symptoms of ADHD, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts,
distractibility, and less need for sleep, overlap with the symptoms of
hypomania. The double counting of symptoms toward both ADHD and bipolar
II disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies whether the
symptoms represent a distinct episode and if the noticeable increase
over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is
present.

Personality disorders.

The same convention as applies for ADHD also applies when evaluating an
individual for a personality disorder such as borderline personality
disorder, since mood lability and impulsivity are common in both
personality disorders and bipolar II disorder. Symptoms must represent a
distinct episode, and the noticeable increase over baseline required for
the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder must be present. A diagnosis of a
personality disorder should not be made during an untreated mood episode
unless the lifetime history supports the presence of a personality
disorder.

Other bipolar disorders.

Diagnosis of bipolar II disorder should be differentiated from bipolar I
disorder by carefully considering whether there have been any past
episodes of mania and from other specified and unspecified bipolar and
related disorders by confirming the presence of fully syndromal
hypomania and depression.

Comorbidity

Bipolar II disorder is more often than not associated with one or more
co-occurring mental disorders, with anxiety disorders being the most
common. Approximately 60% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have
three or more co-occurring mental disorders; 75% have an anxiety
disorder; and 37% have a substance use disorder. Children and
adolescents with bipolar II disorder have a higher rate of co-occurring
anxiety disorders compared with those with bipolar I disorder, and the
anxiety disorder most often predates the bipolar disorder. Anxiety and
substance use disorders occur in individuals with bipolar II disorder at
a higher rate than in the general population. Approximately 14% of
individuals with bipolar II disorder have at least one lifetime eating
disorder, with binge-eating disorder being more common than bulimia
nervosa and anorexia nervosa.

These commonly co-occurring disorders do not seem to follow a course of
illness that is truly independent from that of the bipolar disorder, but
rather have strong associations with mood states. For example, anxiety
and eating disorders tend to associate most with depressive symptoms,
and substance use disorders are moderately associated with manic
symptoms.

Cyclothymic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**301.13 (F34.0)**

A. For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents)
there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not
meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with
depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive
episode.

B. During the above 2-year period (1 year in children and adolescents),
the hypomanic and depressive periods have been present for at least half
the time and the individual has not been without the symptoms for more
than 2 months at a time.

C. Criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have
never been met.

D. The symptoms in Criterion A are not better explained by
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,
delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder.

E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).

[]{#index_split_024.html#p185}**140**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

F. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

*Specify* if:

**With anxious distress** (see p. 149)

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of cyclothymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating
mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and
periods of depressive symptoms that are distinct from each other
(Criterion A). The hypomanic symptoms are of insufficient number,
severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a
hypomanic episode, and the depressive symptoms are of insufficient
number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a
major depressive episode. During the initial 2-year period (1 year for
children or adolescents), the symptoms must be persistent (present more
days than not), and any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2
months (Criterion B). The diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is made only
if the criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have
never been met (Criterion C).

If an individual with cyclothymic disorder subsequently (i.e., after the
initial 2 years in adults or 1 year in children or adolescents)
experiences a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode, the
diagnosis changes to major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, or
other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder
(subclassified as hypomanic episode without prior major depressive
episode), respectively, and the cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is
dropped.

The cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is not made if the pattern of mood
swings is better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,
schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and
unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders
(Criterion D), in which case the mood symptoms are considered associated
features of the psychotic disorder. The mood disturbance must also not
be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g.,
hyperthyroidism) (Criterion E). Although some individuals may function
particularly well during some of the periods of hypomania, over the
prolonged course of the disorder, there must be clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning as a result of the mood disturbance (Criterion F). The
impairment may develop as a result of prolonged periods of cyclical,
often unpredictable mood changes (e.g., the individual may be regarded
as temperamental, moody, unpredictable, inconsistent, or unreliable).

Prevalence

The lifetime prevalence of cyclothymic disorder is approximately
0.4%--1%. Prevalence in mood disorders clinics may range from 3% to 5%.
In the general population, cyclothymic disorder is apparently equally
common in males and females. In clinical settings, females with
cyclothymic disorder may be more likely to present for treatment than
males.

Development and Course

Cyclothymic disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life
and is sometimes considered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to
other disorders in this chapter.

Cyclothymic disorder usually has an insidious onset and a persistent
course. There is a 15%--50% risk that an individual with cyclothymic
disorder will subsequently develop bipolar I disorder or bipolar II
disorder. Onset of persistent, fluctuating hypomanic and depressive
symptoms late in adult life needs to be clearly differentiated from
bipolar and

[]{#index_split_024.html#p186}Cyclothymic Disorder

**141**

related disorder due to another medical condition and depressive
disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis)
before the cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is assigned. Among children
with cyclothymic disorder, the mean age at onset of symptoms is 6.5
years of age.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II disorder
are more common among first-degree biological relatives of individuals
with cyclothymic disorder than in the general population. There may also
be an increased familial risk of substance-related disorders.
Cyclothymic disorder may be more common in the first-degree biological
relatives of individuals with bipolar I disorder than in the general
population.

Differential Diagnosis

Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition and
depressive disorder due to another medical condition.

The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to

another medical condition or depressive disorder due to another medical
condition is made when the mood disturbance is judged to be attributable
to the physiological effect of a specific, usually chronic medical
condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). This determination is based on the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. If it is judged
that the hypomanic and depressive symptoms are not the physiological
consequence of the medical condition, then the primary mental disorder
(i.e., cyclothymic disorder) and the medical condition are coded. For
example, this would be the case if the mood symptoms are considered to
be the psychological (not the physiological) consequence of having a
chronic medical condition, or if there is no etiological relationship
between the hypomanic and depressive symptoms and the medical condition.

Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.

Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related

disorder and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are
distinguished from cyclothymic disorder by the judgment that a
substance/medication (especially stimulants) is etiologically related to
the mood disturbance. The frequent mood swings in these disorders that
are suggestive of cyclothymic disorder usually resolve following
cessation of substance/medication use.

Bipolar I disorder, with rapid cycling, and bipolar II disorder, with
rapid cycling.

Both disorders may resemble cyclothymic disorder by virtue of the
frequent marked shifts in mood. By definition, in cyclothymic disorder
the criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode has
never been met, whereas the bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder
specifier "with rapid cycling" requires that full mood episodes be
present.

Borderline personality disorder.

Borderline personality disorder is associated with

marked shifts in mood that may suggest cyclothymic disorder. If the
criteria are met for both disorders, both borderline personality
disorder and cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed.

Comorbidity

Substance-related disorders and sleep disorders (i.e., difficulties in
initiating and maintaining sleep) may be present in individuals with
cyclothymic disorder. Most children with cyclothymic disorder treated in
outpatient psychiatric settings have comorbid mental conditions; they
are more likely than other pediatric patients with mental disorders to
have comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Bipolar and Related Disorders

Substance/Medication-Induced

Bipolar and Related Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

A. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in
the clinical picture and is characterized by elevated, expansive, or
irritable mood, with or without depressed mood, or markedly diminished
interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):

1\. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance
intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.

2\. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the
symptoms in Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a bipolar or related
disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an
independent bipolar or related disorder could include the following:

The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month)
after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there
is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent
nonsubstance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., a
history of recurrent nonsubstance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-

induced bipolar and related disorders are indicated in the table below.
Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a
comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance.
If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced
bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is "1," and the
clinician should record "mild \[substance\] use disorder" before the
substance-induced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., "mild cocaine use
disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder"). If a
moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position
character is "2," and the clinician should record "moderate
\[substance\] use disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder,"
depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time
heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is "9," and
the clinician should record only the substance-induced bipolar and
related disorder.

Recording Procedures

ICD-9-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced bipolar and related
disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine,
dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms.
The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria
set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit
into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for "other
substance" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged
to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is
unknown, the category "unknown substance" should be used.

The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the
recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-induced
disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a
separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For
example, in the case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication
in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84
cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during
intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use
disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphenidate-induced
bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication; 292.84
dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during
intoxication).

ICD-10-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced bipolar and related
disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine,
dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms.
The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria
set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a
comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any
of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for "other substance"
should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an
etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the
category "unknown substance" should be used.

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the substance-induced

[]{#index_split_024.html#p189}**144**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

bipolar and related disorder, followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example,
in the case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication in a man
with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe
cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder,
with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid
severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced
bipolar and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use
disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no
accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.94
amphetamine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during
intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use
disorder with methylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with
onset during intoxication; F19.94

dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during
intoxication).

Diagnostic Features

The diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced bipolar and
related disorder are essentially the same as those for mania, hypomania,
or depression. A key exception to the diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder is the case of
hypomania or mania that occurs after antidepressant medication use or
other treatments and persists beyond the physiological effects of the
medication. This condition is considered an indicator of true bipolar
disorder, not substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder.
Similarly, individuals with apparent electroconvulsive therapy--induced
manic or hypomanic episodes that persist beyond the physiological
effects of the treatment are diagnosed with bipolar disorder, not
substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder.

Side effects of some antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs (e.g.,
edginess, agitation) may resemble the primary symptoms of a manic
syndrome, but they are fundamentally distinct from bipolar symptoms and
are insufficient for the diagnosis. That is, the criterion symptoms of
mania/hypomania have specificity (simple agitation is not the same as
excess involvement in purposeful activities), and a sufficient number of
symptoms must be present (not just one or two symptoms) to make these
diagnoses. In particular, the appearance of one or two nonspecific
symptoms---irritability, edginess, or agitation during antidepressant
treatment---in the absence of a full manic or hypomanic syndrome should
not be taken to support a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Etiology (causally related to the use of psychotropic medications or
substances of abuse based on best clinical evidence) is the key variable
in this etiologically specified form of bipolar disorder.
Substances/medications that are typically considered to be associated
with substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder include
the stimulant class of drugs, as well as phencyclidine and steroids;
however, a number of potential substances continue to emerge as new
compounds are synthesized (e.g., so-called bath salts).

A history of such substance use may help increase diagnostic certainty.

Prevalence

There are no epidemiological studies of substance/medication-induced
mania or bipolar disorder. Each etiological substance may have its own
individual risk of inducing a bipolar (manic/hypomanic) disorder.

Development and Course

In phencyclidine-induced mania, the initial presentation may be one of a
delirium with affective features, which then becomes an atypically
appearing manic or mixed manic state.

[]{#index_split_024.html#p190}Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to
Another Medical Condition **145**

This condition follows the ingestion or inhalation quickly, usually
within hours or, at the most, a few days. In stimulant-induced manic or
hypomanic states, the response is in minutes to 1 hour after one or
several ingestions or injections. The episode is very brief and
typically resolves over 1--2 days. With corticosteroids and some
immunosuppressant medications, the mania (or mixed or depressed state)
usually follows several days of ingestion, and the higher doses appear
to have a much greater likelihood of producing bipolar symptoms.

Diagnostic Markers

Determination of the substance of use can be made through markers in the
blood or urine to corroborate diagnosis.

Differential Diagnosis

Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder should be
differentiated from other bipolar disorders, substance intoxication or
substance-induced delirium, and medication side effects (as noted
earlier). A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant
treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at
a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that
treatment is sufficient evidence for a bipolar I diagnosis. A full
hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,
medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal
level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient
evidence for a bipolar II diagnosis only if preceded by a major
depressive episode.

Comorbidity

Comorbidities are those associated with the use of illicit substances
(in the case of illegal stimulants or phencyclidine) or diversion of
prescribed stimulants. Comorbidities related to steroid or
immunosuppressant medications are those medical indications for these
preparations. Delirium can occur before or along with manic symptoms in
individuals ingesting phencyclidine or those who are prescribed steroid
medications or other immunosuppressant medications.

Bipolar and Related Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

Diagnostic Criteria

A. A prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, expansive,
or irritable mood and abnormally increased activity or energy that
predominates in the clinical picture.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct
pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, or
necessitates hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there
are psychotic features.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for bipolar and related disorder due
to another medical condition is **293.83,** which is assigned regardless
of the specifier. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier (see
below).

[]{#index_split_024.html#p191}**146**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

*Specify* if:

**(F06.33) With manic features:** Full criteria are not met for a manic
or hypomanic episode.

**(F06.33) With manic-or hypomanic-like episode:** Full criteria are met
except Criterion D for a manic episode or except Criterion F for a
hypomanic episode.

**(F06.34) With mixed features:** Symptoms of depression are also
present but do not predominate in the clinical picture.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the
name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.83 \[F06.33\] bipolar disorder
due to hyperthyroidism, with manic features). The other medical
condition should also be coded and listed separately immediately before
the bipolar and related disorder due to the medical condition (e.g.,
242.90

\[E05.90\] hyperthyroidism; 293.83 \[F06.33\] bipolar disorder due to
hyperthyroidism, with manic features).

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of bipolar and related disorder due to another
medical condition are presence of a prominent and persistent period of
abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally
increased activity or energy predominating in the clinical picture that
is attributable to another medical condition (Criterion B). In most
cases the manic or hypomanic picture may appear during the initial
presentation of the medical condition (i.e., within 1 month); however,
there are exceptions, especially in chronic medical conditions that
might worsen or relapse and herald the appearance of the manic or
hypomanic picture. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical
condition would not be diagnosed when the manic or hypomanic episodes
definitely preceded the medical condition, since the proper diagnosis
would be bipolar disorder (except in the unusual circumstance in which
all preceding manic or hypomanic episodes---or, when only one such
episode has occurred, the preceding manic or hypomanic episode---were
associated with ingestion of a substance/medication). The diagnosis of
bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition should not
be made during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The manic or
hypomanic episode in bipolar and related disorder due to another medical
condition must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning to qualify
for this diagnosis (Criterion E).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Etiology (i.e., a causal relationship to another medical condition based
on best clinical evidence) is the key variable in this etiologically
specified form of bipolar disorder. The listing of medical conditions
that are said to be able to induce mania is never complete, and the
clinician's best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis. Among the
best known of the medical conditions that can cause a bipolar manic or
hypomanic condition are Cushing's disease and multiple sclerosis, as
well as stroke and traumatic brain injuries.

Development and Course

Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition usually
has its onset acutely or subacutely within the first weeks or month of
the onset of the associated medical condition. However, this is not
always the case, as a worsening or later relapse of the associated
medical condition may precede the onset of the manic or hypomanic
syndrome. The clinician must make a clinical judgment in these
situations about whether the medical condition is causative, based on
temporal sequence as well as plausibility of a causal relation-

[]{#index_split_024.html#p192}Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to
Another Medical Condition **147**

ship. Finally, the condition may remit before or just after the medical
condition remits, particularly when treatment of the manic/hypomanic
symptoms is effective.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Culture-related differences, to the extent that there is any evidence,
pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g., rates of
multiple sclerosis and stroke vary around the world based on dietary,
genetic factors, and other environmental factors).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Gender differences pertain to those associated with the medical
condition (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus is more common in females;
stroke is somewhat more common in middle-age males compared with
females).

Diagnostic Markers

Diagnostic markers pertain to those associated with the medical
condition (e.g., steroid levels in blood or urine to help corroborate
the diagnosis of Cushing's disease, which can be associated with manic
or depressive syndromes; laboratory tests confirming the diagnosis of
multiple sclerosis).

Functional Consequences of Bipolar and Related

Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition

Functional consequences of the bipolar symptoms may exacerbate
impairments associated with the medical condition and may incur worse
outcomes due to interference with medical treatment. In general, it is
believed, but not established, that the illness, when induced by
Cushing's disease, will not recur if the Cushing's disease is cured or
arrested.

However, it is also suggested, but not established, that mood syndromes,
including depressive and manic/hypomanic ones, may be episodic (i.e.,
recurring) with static brain injuries and other central nervous system
diseases.

Differential Diagnosis

Symptoms of delirium, catatonia, and acute anxiety.

It is important to differentiate

symptoms of mania from excited or hypervigilant delirious symptoms; from
excited catatonic symptoms; and from agitation related to acute anxiety
states.

Medication-induced depressive or manic symptoms.

An important differential diagnostic observation is that the other
medical condition may be treated with medications (e.g., steroids or
alpha-interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these
cases, clinical judgment using all of the evidence in hand is the best
way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two
etiological factors (i.e., association with the medical condition vs. a
substance/medication-induced syndrome). The differential diagnosis of
the associated medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the
scope of the present manual.

Comorbidity

Conditions comorbid with bipolar and related disorder due to another
medical condition are those associated with the medical conditions of
etiological relevance. Delirium can occur before or along with manic
symptoms in individuals with Cushing's disease.

Bipolar and Related Disorders

Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder

**296.89 (F31.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The
other specified bipolar and related disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific
bipolar and related disorder. This is done by recording "other specified
bipolar and related disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g.,
"short-duration cyclothymia").

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following:

1\. **Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2--3 days) and major depressive
episodes:** A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes
in individuals whose presentation has never met full criteria for a
manic or hypomanic episode but who have experienced two or more episodes
of short-duration hypomania that meet the full symptomatic criteria for
a hypomanic episode but that only last for 2--3 days. The episodes of
hypomanic symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive
episodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major depressive
episode, with mixed features.

2\. **Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major depressive
episodes:** A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes
in individuals whose presentation has never met full criteria for a
manic or hypomanic episode but who have experienced one or more episodes
of hypomania that do not meet full symptomatic criteria (i.e., at least
4 consecutive days of elevated mood and one or two of the other symptoms
of a hypomanic episode, or irritable mood and two or three of the other
symptoms of a hypomanic episode). The episodes of hypomanic symptoms do
not overlap in time with the major depressive episodes, so the
disturbance does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with
mixed features.

3\. **Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive episode:** One or
more hypomanic episodes in an individual whose presentation has never
met full criteria for a major depressive episode or a manic episode. If
this occurs in an individual with an established diagnosis of persistent
depressive disorder (dysthymia), both diagnoses can be concurrently
applied during the periods when the full criteria for a hypomanic
episode are met.

4\. **Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 24 months):** Multiple
episodes of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic
episode and multiple episodes of depressive symptoms that do not meet
criteria for a major depressive episode that persist over a period of
less than 24 months (less than 12 months for children or adolescents) in
an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria for a major
depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and does not meet criteria for
any psychotic disorder. During the course of the disorder, the hypomanic
or depressive symptoms are present for more days than not, the
individual has not been without symptoms for more than 2 months at a
time, and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or
impairment.

[]{#index_split_024.html#p194}Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder
**149**

Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder

**296.80 (F31.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations
in which the clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason that the
criteria are not met for a specific bipolar and related disorder, and
includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to
make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders

*Specify* if:

**With anxious distress:** The presence of at least two of the following
symptoms during the majority of days of the current or most recent
episode of mania, hypomania, or depression:

1\. Feeling keyed up or tense.

2\. Feeling unusually restless.

3\. Difficulty concentrating because of worry.

4\. Fear that something awful may happen.

5\. Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or
herself.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Two symptoms.

**Moderate:** Three symptoms.

**Moderate-severe:** Four or five symptoms.

**Severe:** Four or five symptoms with motor agitation.

**Note:** Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both
bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty
mental health settings. High levels of anxiety have been associated with
higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood
of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to
specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress
for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.

**With mixed features:** The mixed features specifier can apply to the
current manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode in bipolar I or bipolar
II disorder: **Manic or hypomanic episode, with mixed features:**

A. Full criteria are met for a manic episode or hypomanic episode, and
at least three of the following symptoms are present during the majority
of days of the current or most recent episode of mania or hypomania: 1.
Prominent dysphoria or depressed mood as indicated by either subjective
report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g.,
appears tearful).

2\. Diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities
(as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by
others).

3\. Psychomotor retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not
merely subjective feelings of being slowed down).

[]{#index_split_024.html#p195}**150**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

4\. Fatigue or loss of energy.

5\. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (not
merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).

6\. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent
suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a
specific plan for committing suicide.

B. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from
the person's usual behavior.

C. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both
mania and depression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic
episode, with mixed features, due to the marked impairment and clinical
severity of full mania.

D. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects
of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment).

**Depressive episode, with mixed features:**

A. Full criteria are met for a major depressive episode, and at least
three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present during the
majority of days of the current or most recent episode of depression:

1\. Elevated, expansive mood.

2\. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.

3\. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.

4\. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.

5\. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at
work or school, or sexually).

6\. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high
potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained
buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).

7\. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than
usual; to be contrasted with insomnia).

B. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from
the person's usual behavior.

C. For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both
mania and depression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic
episode, with mixed features.

D. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects
of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or other
treatment).

**Note:** Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have
been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of
bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.

As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this
specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to
treatment.

**With rapid cycling** (can be applied to bipolar I or bipolar II
disorder): Presence of at least four mood episodes in the previous 12
months that meet the criteria for manic, hypomanic, or major depressive
episode.

**Note:** Episodes are demarcated by either partial or full remissions
of at least 2 months or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity
(e.g., major depressive episode to manic episode).

**Note:** The essential feature of a rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is
the occurrence of at least four mood episodes during the previous 12
months. These episodes can occur in any combination and order. The
episodes must meet both the duration and

[]{#index_split_024.html#p196}Specifiers for Bipolar and Related
Disorders **151**

symptom number criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic
episode and must be demarcated by either a period of full remission or a
switch to an episode of the opposite polarity. Manic and hypomanic
episodes are counted as being on the same pole. Except for the fact that
they occur more frequently, the episodes that occur in a rapid-cycling
pattern are no different from those that occur in a non-rapid-cycling
pattern. Mood episodes that count toward defining a rapid-cycling
pattern exclude those episodes directly caused by a substance (e.g.,
cocaine, corticosteroids) or another medical condition.

**With melancholic features:**

A. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the
current episode: 1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.

2\. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel
much better, even temporarily, when something good happens).

B. Three (or more) of the following:

1\. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound
despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood.

2\. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.

3\. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual
awakening).

4\. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.

5\. Significant anorexia or weight loss.

6\. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.

**Note:** The specifier "with melancholic features" is applied if these
features are present at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a
near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure, not merely a
diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reactivity of mood is
that even highly desired events are not associated with marked
brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it
brightens only partially (e.g., up to 20%--40% of normal for only
minutes at a time). The "distinct quality" of mood that is
characteristic of the "with melancholic features" specifier is
experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic
depressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more
severe, longer lasting, or present without a reason is not considered
distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always present and
are observable by others.

Melancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across
episodes in the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients,
as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to occur in milder than in
more severe major depressive episodes; and are more likely to occur in
those with psychotic features.

**With atypical features:** This specifier can be applied when these
features predominate during the majority of days of the current or most
recent major depressive episode.

A. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or
potential positive events).

B. Two (or more) of the following features:

1\. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.

2\. Hypersomnia.

3\. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).

4\. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not
limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant
social or occupational impairment.

[]{#index_split_024.html#p197}**152**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

C. Criteria are not met for "with melancholic features" or "with
catatonia" during the same episode.

**Note:** "Atypical depression" has historical significance (i.e.,
atypical in contradistinction to the more classical agitated,
"endogenous" presentations of depression that were the norm when
depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in
adolescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon or
unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply.

Mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with
positive events (e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others).
Mood may become euthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of time if
the external circumstances remain favorable. Increased appetite may be
manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain.
Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or
daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at
least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined
as feeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs.
This sensation is generally present for at least an hour a day but often
lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical features,
pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait
that has an early onset and persists throughout most of adult life.
Rejection sensitivity occurs both when the person is and is not
depressed, though it may be exacerbated during depressive periods.

**With psychotic features:** Delusions or hallucinations are present at
any time in the episode. If psychotic features are present, specify if
mood-congruent or mood-incongruent:

**With mood-congruent psychotic features:** During manic episodes, the
content of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the
typical manic themes of grandiosity, invulnerability, etc., but may also
include themes of suspiciousness or paranoia, especially with respect to
others' doubts about the individual's capacities, accomplishments, and
so forth.

**With mood-incongruent psychotic features:** The content of delusions
and hallucinations is inconsistent with the episode polarity themes as
described above, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and
mood-congruent themes.

**With catatonia:** This specifier can apply to an episode of mania or
depression if catatonic features are present during most of the episode.
See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental disorder in the
chapter "Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders."

**With peripartum onset:** This specifier can be applied to the current
or, if the full criteria are not currently met for a mood episode, most
recent episode of mania, hypomania, or major depression in bipolar I or
bipolar II disorder if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or
in the 4 weeks following delivery.

**Note:** Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or
postpartum.

Although the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up after
delivery, between 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of a
major depressive episode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months
following delivery. Fifty percent of "postpartum" major depressive
episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus, these episodes are
referred to collectively as *peripartum* episodes. Women with peripartum
major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic
attacks. Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety
symptoms during pregnancy, as well as the "baby blues," increase the
risk for a postpartum major depressive episode.

[]{#index_split_024.html#p198}Specifiers for Bipolar and Related
Disorders **153**

Peripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without
psychotic features. Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum
psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to
kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed, but psychotic
symptoms can also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes without such
specific delusions or hallucinations.

Postpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic
features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and
may be more common in primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes
with psychotic features is particularly increased for women with prior
postpartum mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior
history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially bipolar I
disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.

Once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the
risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%.
Postpartum episodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in
the postpartum period, which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of
awareness or attention. The postpartum period is unique with respect to
the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and psychosocial adjustments,
the potential impact of breast-feeding on treatment planning, and the
long-term implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder on
subsequent family planning.

**With seasonal pattern:** This specifier applies to the lifetime
pattern of mood episodes.

The essential feature is a regular seasonal pattern of at least one type
of episode (i.e., mania, hypomania, or depression). The other types of
episodes may not follow this pattern. For example, an individual may
have seasonal manias, but his or her depressions do not regularly occur
at a specific time of year.

A. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of
manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes and a particular time of
the year (e.g., in the fall or winter) in bipolar I or bipolar II
disorder.

**Note:** Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of
seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being
unemployed every winter).

B. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or
hypomania or vice versa) also occur at a characteristic time of the year
(e.g., depression disappears in the spring).

C. In the last 2 years, the individual's manic, hypomanic, or major
depressive episodes have demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship,
as defined above, and no nonseasonal episodes of that polarity have
occurred during that 2-year period.

D. Seasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described above)
substantially outnumber any nonseasonal manias, hypomanias, or
depressions that may have occurred over the individual's lifetime.

**Note:** This specifier can be applied to the pattern of major
depressive episodes in bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or major
depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature is the onset and
remission of major depressive episodes at characteristic times of the
year. In most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in
spring. Less commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive
episodes. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have
occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal
episodes occurring during this period. In addition, the seasonal
depressive episodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal
depressive episodes over the individual's lifetime.

This specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern
is better explained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g.,
seasonal unemployment or school schedule). Major depressive episodes
that occur in a seasonal pattern

[]{#index_split_024.html#p199}**154**

Bipolar and Related Disorders

are often characterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia, overeating,
weight gain, and a craving for carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a
seasonal pattern is more likely in recurrent major depressive disorder
or in bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar disorders group, a
seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than
in bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic or
hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season.

The prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with
latitude, age, and sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age
is also a strong predictor of seasonality, with younger persons at
higher risk for winter depressive episodes.

*Specify* if:

**In partial remission:** Symptoms of the immediately previous manic,
hypomanic, or depressive episode are present, but full criteria are not
met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months without any
significant symptoms of a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode
following the end of such an episode.

**In full remission:** During the past 2 months, no significant signs or
symptoms of the disturbance were present.

*Specify* current severity:

Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of
those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability.

**Mild:** Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to meet the
diagnostic criteria are present, the intensity of the symptoms is
distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment
in social or occupational functioning.

**Moderate:** The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or
functional impairment are between those specified for "mild" and
"severe."

**Severe:** The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of those
required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is
seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms markedly
interfere with social and occupational functioning.

[]{#index_split_024.html#p200}**Depressive**

**Disorders**

Depressive disorders include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder,
major depressive disorder (including major depressive episode),
persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), premenstrual dysphoric
disorder, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder, depressive
disorder due to another medical condition, other specified depressive
disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder. Unlike in DSM-IV, this
chapter

"Depressive Disorders" has been separated from the previous chapter
"Bipolar and Related Disorders." The common feature of all of these
disorders is the presence of sad, empty, or irritable mood, accompanied
by somatic and cognitive changes that significantly affect the
individual's capacity to function. What differs among them are issues of
duration, timing, or presumed etiology.

In order to address concerns about the potential for the overdiagnosis
of and treatment for bipolar disorder in children, a new diagnosis,
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, referring to the presentation of
children with persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme
behavioral dyscontrol, is added to the depressive disorders for children
up to 12 years of age. Its placement in this chapter reflects the
finding that children with this symptom pattern typically develop
unipolar depressive disorders or anxiety disorders, rather than bipolar
disorders, as they mature into adolescence and adulthood.

Major depressive disorder represents the classic condition in this group
of disorders. It is characterized by discrete episodes of at least 2
weeks' duration (although most episodes last considerably longer)
involving clear-cut changes in affect, cognition, and neurovege-tative
functions and inter-episode remissions. A diagnosis based on a single
episode is possible, although the disorder is a recurrent one in the
majority of cases. Careful consideration is given to the delineation of
normal sadness and grief from a major depressive episode. Bereavement
may induce great suffering, but it does not typically induce an episode
of major depressive disorder. When they do occur together, the
depressive symptoms and functional impairment tend to be more severe and
the prognosis is worse compared with bereavement that is not accompanied
by major depressive disorder. Bereavement-related depression tends to
occur in persons with other vulnerabilities to depressive disorders, and
recovery may be facilitated by antidepressant treatment.

A more chronic form of depression, persistent depressive disorder
(dysthymia), can be diagnosed when the mood disturbance continues for at
least 2 years in adults or 1 year in children. This diagnosis, new in
DSM-5, includes both the DSM-IV diagnostic categories of chronic major
depression and dysthymia.

After careful scientific review of the evidence, premenstrual dysphoric
disorder has been moved from an appendix of DSM-IV ("Criteria Sets and
Axes Provided for Further Study") to Section II of DSM-5. Almost 20
years of additional of research on this condition has confirmed a
specific and treatment-responsive form of depressive disorder that
begins sometime following ovulation and remits within a few days of
menses and has a marked impact on functioning.

A large number of substances of abuse, some prescribed medications, and
several medical conditions can be associated with depression-like
phenomena. This fact is recognized in the diagnoses of
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder and depressive disorder
due to another medical condition.

Depressive Disorders

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**296.99 (F34.8)**

A. Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g., verbal
rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward people or
property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to
the situation or provocation.

B. The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level.

C. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week.

D. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry
most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g.,
parents, teachers, peers).

E. Criteria A--D have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout
that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more
consecutive months without all of the symptoms in Criteria A--D.

F. Criteria A and D are present in at least two of three settings (i.e.,
at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of these.

G. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6
years or after age 18

years.

H. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria A--E is
before 10 years.

I.

There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during
which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or
hypomanic episode have been met.

**Note:** Developmentally appropriate mood elevation, such as occurs in
the context of a highly positive event or its anticipation, should not
be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania.

J. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major
depressive disorder and are not better explained by another mental
disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder,
separation anxiety disorder, persistent depressive disorder
\[dysthymia\]).

**Note:** This diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant
disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder, though
it can coexist with others, including major depressive disorder,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and
substance use disorders. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for
both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant
disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or
hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder should not be assigned.

K. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or to another medical or neurological condition.

Diagnostic Features

The core feature of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is chronic,
severe persistent irritability. This severe irritability has two
prominent clinical manifestations, the first of which is frequent temper
outbursts. These outbursts typically occur in response to frustration
and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression
against property, self, or others). They must occur frequently (i.e., on
average, three or more times per week) (Criterion C) over at least 1
year in at least two settings (Criteria E and F), such as in the home
and at school, and they must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion
B).

The second manifestation of severe irritability consists of chronic,
persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe
temper outbursts. This irritable or angry mood must be characteristic of
the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day, and
noticeable by others in the child's environment (Criterion D).

[]{#index_split_024.html#p202}Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder
**157**

The clinical presentation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must
be carefully distinguished from presentations of other, related
conditions, particularly pediatric bipolar disorder. In fact, disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder was added to DSM-5 to address the
considerable concern about the appropriate classification and treatment
of children who present with chronic, persistent irritability relative
to children who present with classic (i.e., episodic) bipolar disorder.

Some researchers view severe, nonepisodic irritability as characteristic
of bipolar disorder in children, although both DSM-IV and DSM-5 require
that both children and adults have distinct episodes of mania or
hypomania to qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. During the
latter decades of the 20th century, this contention by researchers that
severe, nonepisodic irritability is a manifestation of pediatric mania
coincided with an up-surge in the rates at which clinicians assigned the
diagnosis of bipolar disorder to their pediatric patients. This sharp
increase in rates appears to be attributable to clinicians combining at
least two clinical presentations into a single category. That is, both
classic, episodic presentations of mania and nonepisodic presentations
of severe irritability have been labeled as bipolar disorder in
children. In DSM-5, the term *bipolar disorder* is explicitly reserved
for episodic presentations of bipolar symptoms. DSM-IV did not include a
diagnosis designed to capture youths whose hallmark symptoms consisted
of very severe, nonepisodic irritability, whereas DSM-5, with the
inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, provides a distinct
category for such presentations.

Prevalence

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children
presenting to pediatric mental health clinics. Prevalence estimates of
the disorder in the community are unclear. Based on rates of chronic and
severe persistent irritability, which is the core feature of the
disorder, the overall 6-month to 1-year period-prevalence of disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder among children and adolescents probably
falls in the 2%--5% range.

However, rates are expected to be higher in males and school-age
children than in females and adolescents.

Development and Course

The onset of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be before age
10 years, and the diagnosis should not be applied to children with a
developmental age of less than 6 years.

It is unknown whether the condition presents only in this age-delimited
fashion. Because the symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
are likely to change as children mature, use of the diagnosis should be
restricted to age groups similar to those in which validity has been
established (7--18 years). Approximately half of children with severe,
chronic irritability will have a presentation that continues to meet
criteria for the condition 1 year later. Rates of conversion from
severe, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder are very low.
Instead, children with chronic irritability are at risk to develop
unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood.

Age-related variations also differentiate classic bipolar disorder and
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Rates of bipolar disorder
generally are very low prior to adolescence (\<1%), with a steady
increase into early adulthood (1%--2% prevalence). Disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder is more common than bipolar disorder prior to
adolescence, and symptoms of the condition generally become less common
as children transition into adulthood.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated
psychiatric histories. In such children, a relatively extensive history
of chronic irritability is

[]{#index_split_024.html#p203}**158**

Depressive Disorders

common, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are
met. Such predi-agnostic presentations may have qualified for a
diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder.

Many children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have symptoms
that also meet criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) and for an anxiety disorder, with such diagnoses often being
present from a relatively early age. For some children, the criteria for
major depressive disorder may also be met.

Genetic and physiological.

In terms of familial aggregation and genetics, it has been suggested
that children presenting with chronic, nonepisodic irritability can be
differentiated from children with bipolar disorder in their family-based
risk. However, these two groups do not differ in familial rates of
anxiety disorders, unipolar depressive disorders, or substance abuse.
Compared with children with pediatric bipolar disorder or other mental
illnesses, those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit
both commonalities and differences in information-processing deficits.
For example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed
decision making and cognitive control, are present in children with
bipolar disorder and chronically irritable children, as well as in
children with some other psychiatric conditions. There is also evidence
for disorder-specific dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing
attention deployment in response to emotional stimuli, which has
demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic
irritability.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Children presenting to clinics with features of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder are predominantly male. Among community samples,
a male preponderance appears to be supported. This difference in
prevalence between males and females differentiates disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder, in which there is an equal
gender prevalence.

Suicide Risk

In general, evidence documenting suicidal behavior and aggression, as
well as other severe functional consequences, in disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder should be noted when evaluating children with
chronic irritability.

Functional Consequences of

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder

Chronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder, is associated with marked disruption in a
child's family and peer relationships, as well as in school performance.
Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children
generally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to
participate in the activities typically enjoyed by healthy children;
their family life is severely disrupted by their outbursts and
irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining
friendships.

Levels of dysfunction in children with bipolar disorder and disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder are generally comparable. Both conditions
cause severe disruption in the lives of the affected individual and
their families. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and
pediatric bipolar disorder, dangerous behavior, suicidal ideation or
suicide attempts, severe aggression, and psychiatric hospitalization are
common.

Differential Diagnosis

Because chronically irritable children and adolescents typically present
with complex histories, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder must be made while considering the presence or absence of
multiple other conditions. Despite the need to consider

[]{#index_split_024.html#p204}Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder
**159**

many other syndromes, differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder from bipolar disorder and oppositional defiant disorder
requires particularly careful assessment.

Bipolar disorders.

The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder and bipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal
course of the core symptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I
disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with
discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from
the child's typical presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs
during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child's usual
mood. In addition, during a manic episode, the change in mood must be
accompanied by the onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive,
behavioral, and physical symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased
goal-directed activity), which are also present to a degree that is
distinctly different from the child's usual baseline. Thus, in the case
of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on developmental level,
children) should be able to identify a distinct time period during which
the child's mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. In
contrast, the irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is
persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to
a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child
with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while bipolar
disorders are episodic conditions, disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder is not. In fact, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder cannot be assigned to a child who has ever experienced a
full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who
has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day.
Another central differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or
expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of
mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder.

Oppositional defiant disorder.

While symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder typically do occur in
children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, mood symptoms of
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are relatively rare in children
with oppositional defiant disorder. The key features that warrant the
diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children whose
symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are the
presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persistent
disruption in mood between outbursts. In addition, the diagnosis of
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder requires severe impairment in at
least one setting (i.e., home, school, or among peers) and mild to
moderate impairment in a second setting. For this reason, while most
children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for
oppositional defiant disorder, the reverse is not the case. That is, in
only approximately 15% of individuals with oppositional defiant disorder
would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met.
Moreover, even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met,
only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be
made. Finally, both the prominent mood symptoms in disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder and the high risk for depressive and anxiety
disorders in follow-up studies justify placement of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder among the depressive disorders in DSM-5.
(Oppositional defiant disorder is included in the chapter "Disruptive,
Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders.") This reflects the more
prominent mood component among individuals with disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional
defiant disorder. Nevertheless, it also should be noted that disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral
problems as well as mood problems.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder,
anxiety disorders, and autism spectrum disorder.

Unlike children diagnosed with bipolar disorder or oppositional defiant
disorder, a child whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD,
major depressive disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. However, children
whose irritability is present only in the context of a major depressive
episode or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)

[]{#index_split_024.html#p205}**160**

Depressive Disorders

should receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder. Children with disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder may have symptoms that also meet criteria for an anxiety
disorder and can receive both diagnoses, but children whose irritability
is manifest only in the context of exacerbation of an anxiety disorder
should receive the relevant anxiety disorder diagnosis rather than
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. In addition, children with
autism spectrum disorders frequently present with temper outbursts when,
for example, their routines are disturbed. In that instance, the temper
outbursts would be considered secondary to the autism spectrum disorder,
and the child should not receive the diagnosis of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder.

Intermittent explosive disorder.

Children with symptoms suggestive of intermittent

explosive disorder present with instances of severe temper outbursts,
much like children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. However,
unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive
disorder does not require persistent disruption in mood between
outbursts. In addition, intermittent explosive disorder requires only 3
months of active symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, these two diagnoses should
not be made in the same child. For children with outbursts and
intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder should be made.

Comorbidity

Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are
extremely high. It is rare to find individuals whose symptoms meet
criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone. Comorbidity
between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and other DSM-defined
syndromes appears higher than for many other pediatric mental illnesses;
the strongest overlap is with oppositional defiant disorder. Not only is
the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses appears particularly
diverse. These children typically present to the clinic with a wide
range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum
symptoms and diagnoses. However, children with disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder should not have symptoms that meet criteria for
bipolar disorder, as in that context, only the bipolar disorder
diagnosis should be made. If children have symptoms that meet criteria
for oppositional defiant disorder or intermittent explosive disorder
*and* disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be assigned. Also, as
noted earlier, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an
anxiety-provoking context, when the routines of a child with autism
spectrum disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in
the context of a major depressive episode.

Major Depressive Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the
same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at
least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of
interest or pleasure.

**Note:** Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to
another medical condition.

1\. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by
either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or
observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (**Note:** In
children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly diminished
interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day,
nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or
observation).

[]{#index_split_024.html#p206}Major Depressive Disorder

**161**

3\. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a
change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or
increase in appetite nearly every day.

(**Note:** In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.

5\. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by
others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed
down).

6\. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.

7\. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which
may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt
about being sick).

8\. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness,
nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by
others).

9\. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent
suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a
specific plan for committing suicide.

B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or to another medical condition.

**Note:** Criteria A--C represent a major depressive episode.

**Note:** Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial
ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or
disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination
about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in
Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such
symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss,
the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal
response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This
decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on
the individual's history and the cultural norms for the expression of
distress in the context of loss.1

D. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better
explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform
disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.

**Note:** This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or
hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the
physiological effects of another medical condition.

1 In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is
useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of
emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent depressed mood and the
inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is
likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves,
the so-called pangs of grief. These waves tend to be associated with
thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The depressed mood of MDE is more
persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.

The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that
are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery
characteristic of MDE. The thought content associated with grief
generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the
deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen
in MDE. In grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in MDE
feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If
self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves
perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently
enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If a
bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are
generally focused on the deceased and possibly about "joining" the
deceased, whereas in MDE such thoughts are focused on ending one's own
life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to
cope with the pain of depression.

**Coding and Recording Procedures**

The diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether
this is a single or recurrent episode, current severity, presence of
psychotic features, and remission status.

Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full
criteria are currently met for a major depressive episode. Remission
specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met
for a major depressive episode. Codes are as follows: Severity/course
specifier

Single episode

Diagnostic Features

The criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present
nearly every day to be considered present, with the exception of weight
change and suicidal ideation. Depressed mood must be present for most of
the day, in addition to being present nearly every day. Often insomnia
or fatigue is the presenting complaint, and failure to probe for
accompanying depressive symptoms will result in underdiagnosis. Sadness
may be denied at first but may be elicited through interview or inferred
from facial expression and demeanor. With individuals who focus on a
somatic complaint, clinicians should determine whether the distress from
that complaint is associated with specific depressive symptoms. Fatigue
and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases;
psychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of
greater overall severity, as is the presence of delusional or
near-delusional guilt.

[]{#index_split_025.html#p208}Major Depressive Disorder

**163**

The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at
least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of
interest or pleasure in nearly all activities (Criterion A). In children
and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad.

The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms
drawn from a list that includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep,
and psychomotor activity; decreased energy; feelings of worthlessness or
guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions; or
recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or
attempts. To count toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must
either be newly present or must have clearly worsened compared with the
person's pre-episode status. The symptoms must persist for most of the
day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The episode
must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For some
individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal
but requires markedly increased effort.

The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person
as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or "down in the dumps"
(Criterion A1). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may
subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out that the
individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals
who complain of feeling "blah," having no feelings, or feeling anxious,
the presence of a depressed mood can be inferred from the person's
facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals emphasize somatic
complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings
of sadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability
(e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry
outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over
minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood
may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should
be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated.

Loss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some
degree. Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, "not
caring anymore," or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were
previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family members often
notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a
formerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer
finds excuses not to practice). In some individuals, there is a
significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire.

Appetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some
depressed individuals report that they have to force themselves to eat.
Others may eat more and may crave specific foods (e.g., sweets or other
carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in either direction),
there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a
failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3).

Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or
sleeping excessively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it
typically takes the form of middle insomnia (i.e., waking up during the
night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal
insomnia (i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep).
Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur.
Individuals who present with over-sleeping (hypersomnia) may experience
prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Sometimes
the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the disturbed
sleep.

Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still,
pacing, hand-wringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or
other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body
movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased
in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness)
(Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe
enough to be observable by others and not represent merely subjective
feelings.

Decreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). A
person may report sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the
smallest tasks seem to require

[]{#index_split_025.html#p209}**164**

Depressive Disorders

substantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may
be reduced. For example, an individual may complain that washing and
dressing in the morning are exhausting and take twice as long as usual.

The sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive
episode may include unrealistic negative evaluations of one's worth or
guilty preoccupations or ruminations over minor past failings (Criterion
A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral or trivial day-to-day
events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense of
responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt
may be of delusional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced
that he or she is personally responsible for world poverty). Blaming
oneself for being sick and for failing to meet occupational or
interpersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very
common and, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this
criterion.

Many individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make
even minor decisions (Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted
or complain of memory difficulties. Those engaged in cognitively
demanding pursuits are often unable to function. In children, a
precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In elderly
individuals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be
mistaken for early signs of a dementia ("pseudodementia"). When the
major depressive episode is successfully treated, the memory problems
often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particularly elderly
persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial
presentation of an irreversible dementia.

Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9)
are common.

They may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a
belief that others would be better off if the individual were dead, to
transient but recurrent thoughts of committing suicide, to a specific
suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put their
affairs in order (e.g., updated wills, settled debts), acquired needed
materials (e.g., a rope or a gun), and chosen a location and time to
accomplish the suicide. Motivations for suicide may include a desire to
give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles, an intense
wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful
emotional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the
wish to not be a burden to others. The resolution of such thinking may
be a more meaningful measure of diminished suicide risk than denial of
further plans for suicide.

The evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is
especially difficult when they occur in an individual who also has a
general medical condition (e.g., cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction,
diabetes, pregnancy). Some of the criterion signs and symptoms of a
major depressive episode are identical to those of general medical
conditions (e.g., weight loss with untreated diabetes; fatigue with
cancer; hypersomnia early in pregnancy; insomnia later in pregnancy or
the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a major depressive diagnosis
except when they are clearly and fully attributable to a general medical
condition. Nonvegetative symptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or
worthlessness, impaired concentration or indecision, and suicidal
thoughts should be assessed with particular care in such cases.
Definitions of major depressive episodes that have been modified to
include only these nonvegetative symptoms appear to identify nearly the
same individuals as do the full criteria.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Major depressive disorder is associated with high mortality, much of
which is accounted for by suicide; however, it is not the only cause.
For example, depressed individuals admitted to nursing homes have a
markedly increased likelihood of death in the first year. Individuals
frequently present with tearfulness, irritability, brooding, obsessive
rumination, anxiety, phobias, excessive worry over physical health, and
complaints of pain (e.g., headaches; joint, abdominal, or other pains).
In children, separation anxiety may occur.

[]{#index_split_025.html#p210}Major Depressive Disorder

**165**

Although an extensive literature exists describing neuroanatomical,
neuroendocrino-logical, and neurophysiological correlates of major
depressive disorder, no laboratory test has yielded results of
sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool
for this disorder. Until recently, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
hyperactivity had been the most extensively investigated abnormality
associated with major depressive episodes, and it appears to be
associated with melancholia, psychotic features, and risks for eventual
suicide. Molecular studies have also implicated peripheral factors,
including genetic variants in neurotrophic factors and pro-inflammatory
cytokines. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies
provide evidence for functional abnormalities in specific neural systems
supporting emotion processing, reward seeking, and emotion regulation in
adults with major depression.

Prevalence

Twelve-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the United
States is approximately 7%, with marked differences by age group such
that the prevalence in 18-to 29-year-old individuals is threefold higher
than the prevalence in individuals age 60 years or older. Females
experience 1.5-to 3-fold higher rates than males beginning in early
adolescence.

Development and Course

Major depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the
likelihood of onset increases markedly with puberty. In the United
States, incidence appears to peak in the 20s; however, first onset in
late life is not uncommon.

The course of major depressive disorder is quite variable, such that
some individuals rarely, if ever, experience remission (a period of 2 or
more months with no symptoms, or only one or two symptoms to no more
than a mild degree), while others experience many years with few or no
symptoms between discrete episodes. It is important to distinguish
individuals who present for treatment during an exacerbation of a
chronic depressive illness from those whose symptoms developed recently.
Chronicity of depressive symptoms substantially increases the likelihood
of underlying personality, anxiety, and substance use disorders and
decreases the likelihood that treatment will be followed by full symptom
resolution. It is therefore useful to ask individuals presenting with
depressive symptoms to identify the last period of at least 2 months
during which they were entirely free of depressive symptoms.

Recovery typically begins within 3 months of onset for two in five
individuals with major depression and within 1 year for four in five
individuals. Recency of onset is a strong determinant of the likelihood
of near-term recovery, and many individuals who have been depressed only
for several months can be expected to recover spontaneously. Features
associated with lower recovery rates, other than current episode
duration, include psychotic features, prominent anxiety, personality
disorders, and symptom severity.

The risk of recurrence becomes progessively lower over time as the
duration of remission increases. The risk is higher in individuals whose
preceding episode was severe, in younger individuals, and in individuals
who have already experienced multiple episodes. The persistence of even
mild depressive symptoms during remission is a powerful predictor of
recurrence.

Many bipolar illnesses begin with one or more depressive episodes, and a
substantial proportion of individuals who initially appear to have major
depressive disorder will prove, in time, to instead have a bipolar
disorder. This is more likely in individuals with onset of the illness
in adolescence, those with psychotic features, and those with a family
history of bipolar illness. The presence of a "with mixed features"
specifier also increases the risk for future manic or hypomanic
diagnosis. Major depressive disorder, particularly with psychotic
features, may also transition into schizophrenia, a change that is much
more frequent than the reverse.

[]{#index_split_025.html#p211}**166**

Depressive Disorders

Despite consistent differences between genders in prevalence rates for
depressive disorders, there appear to be no clear differences by gender
in phenomenology, course, or treatment response. Similarly, there are no
clear effects of current age on the course or treatment response of
major depressive disorder. Some symptom differences exist, though, such
that hypersomnia and hyperphagia are more likely in younger individuals,
and melancholic symptoms, particularly psychomotor disturbances, are
more common in older individuals.

The likelihood of suicide attempts lessens in middle and late life,
although the risk of completed suicide does not. Depressions with
earlier ages at onset are more familial and more likely to involve
personality disturbances. The course of major depressive disorder within
individuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times to recovery
appear to be stable over long periods, and the likelihood of being in an
episode does not generally increase or decrease with time.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Neuroticism (negative affectivity) is a well-established risk factor for
the onset of major depressive disorder, and high levels appear to render
individuals more likely to develop depressive episodes in response to
stressful life events.

Environmental.

Adverse childhood experiences, particularly when there are multiple
experiences of diverse types, constitute a set of potent risk factors
for major depressive disorder. Stressful life events are well recognized
as precipitants of major depressive episodes, but the presence or
absence of adverse life events near the onset of episodes does not
appear to provide a useful guide to prognosis or treatment selection.

Genetic and physiological.

First-degree family members of individuals with major depressive
disorder have a risk for major depressive disorder two-to fourfold
higher than that of the general population. Relative risks appear to be
higher for early-onset and recurrent forms. Heritability is
approximately 40%, and the personality trait neuroticism accounts for a
substantial portion of this genetic liability.

Course modifiers.

Essentially all major nonmood disorders increase the risk of an
individual developing depression. Major depressive episodes that develop
against the background of another disorder often follow a more
refractory course. Substance use, anxiety, and borderline personality
disorders are among the most common of these, and the presenting
depressive symptoms may obscure and delay their recognition. However,
sustained clinical improvement in depressive symptoms may depend on the
appropriate treatment of underlying illnesses. Chronic or disabling
medical conditions also increase risks for major depressive episodes.
Such prevalent illnesses as diabetes, morbid obesity, and cardiovascular
disease are often complicated by depressive episodes, and these episodes
are more likely to become chronic than are depressive episodes in
medically healthy individuals.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Surveys of major depressive disorder across diverse cultures have shown
sevenfold differences in 12-month prevalence rates but much more
consistency in female-to-male ratio, mean ages at onset, and the degree
to which presence of the disorder raises the likelihood of comorbid
substance abuse. While these findings suggest substantial cultural
differences in the expression of major depressive disorder, they do not
permit simple linkages between particular cultures and the likelihood of
specific symptoms. Rather, clinicians should be aware that in most
countries the majority of cases of depression go unrecognized in primary
care settings and that in many cultures, somatic symptoms are very
likely to constitute the presenting complaint. Among the Criterion A
symptoms, insomnia and loss of energy are the most uniformly reported.

[]{#index_split_025.html#p212}Major Depressive Disorder

**167**

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Although the most reproducible finding in the epidemiology of major
depressive disorder has been a higher prevalence in females, there are
no clear differences between genders in symptoms, course, treatment
response, or functional consequences. In women, the risk for suicide
attempts is higher, and the risk for suicide completion is lower. The
disparity in suicide rate by gender is not as great among those with
depressive disorders as it is in the population as a whole.

Suicide Risk

The possibility of suicidal behavior exists at all times during major
depressive episodes.

The most consistently described risk factor is a past history of suicide
attempts or threats, but it should be remembered that most completed
suicides are not preceded by unsuccessful attempts. Other features
associated with an increased risk for completed suicide include male
sex, being single or living alone, and having prominent feelings of
hopelessness. The presence of borderline personality disorder markedly
increases risk for future suicide attempts.

Functional Consequences of

Major Depressive Disorder

Many of the functional consequences of major depressive disorder derive
from individual symptoms. Impairment can be very mild, such that many of
those who interact with the affected individual are unaware of
depressive symptoms. Impairment may, however, range to complete
incapacity such that the depressed individual is unable to attend to
basic self-care needs or is mute or catatonic. Among individuals seen in
general medical settings, those with major depressive disorder have more
pain and physical illness and greater decreases in physical, social, and
role functioning.

Differential Diagnosis

Manic episodes with irritable mood or mixed episodes.

Major depressive episodes

with prominent irritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from manic
episodes with irritable mood or from mixed episodes. This distinction
requires a careful clinical evaluation of the presence of manic
symptoms.

Mood disorder due to another medical condition.

A major depressive episode is the

appropriate diagnosis if the mood disturbance is not judged, based on
individual history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, to be
the direct pathophysiological consequence of a specific medical
condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism).

Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder.

This disorder is distinguished from major depressive disorder by the
fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin)
appears to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. For
example, depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal
from cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced depressive disorder.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Distractibility and low frustration tolerance

can occur in both attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and a major
depressive episode; if the criteria are met for both,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be diagnosed in addition to
the mood disorder. However, the clinician must be cautious not to
overdiagnose a major depressive episode in children with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder whose disturbance in mood is
characterized by irritability rather than by sadness or loss of
interest.

[]{#index_split_025.html#p213}**168**

Depressive Disorders

Adjustment disorder with depressed mood.

A major depressive episode that occurs in

response to a psychosocial stressor is distinguished from adjustment
disorder with depressed mood by the fact that the full criteria for a
major depressive episode are not met in adjustment disorder.

Sadness.

Finally, periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human
experience.

These periods should not be diagnosed as a major depressive episode
unless criteria are met for severity (i.e., five out of nine symptoms),
duration (i.e., most of the day, nearly every day for at least 2 weeks),
and clinically significant distress or impairment. The diagnosis other
specified depressive disorder may be appropriate for presentations of
depressed mood with clinically significant impairment that do not meet
criteria for duration or severity.

Comorbidity

Other disorders with which major depressive disorder frequently
co-occurs are substance-related disorders, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and
borderline personality disorder.

Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.4 (F34.1)**

This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic major
depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder.

A. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as
indicated by either subjective account or observation by others, for at
least 2 years.

**Note:** In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and
duration must be at least 1 year.

B. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following: 1. Poor
appetite or overeating.

2\. Insomnia or hypersomnia.

3\. Low energy or fatigue.

4\. Low self-esteem.

5\. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions.

6\. Feelings of hopelessness.

C. During the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents) of the
disturbance, the individual has never been without the symptoms in
Criteria A and B for more than 2 months at a time.

D. Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously present
for 2 years.

E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode, and
criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder.

F. The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other
specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorder.

G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition (e.g. hypothyroidism).

H. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include
four symptoms that are absent from the symptom list for persistent
depressive disorder (dysthymia), a very limited

[]{#index_split_025.html#p214}Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)
**169**

number of individuals will have depressive symptoms that have persisted
longer than 2 years but will not meet criteria for persistent depressive
disorder. If full criteria for a major depressive episode have been met
at some point during the current episode of illness, they should be
given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Otherwise, a diagnosis
of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive
disorder is warranted.

Full criteria for a major depressive episode are currently met, but
there have been periods of at least 8 weeks in at least the preceding 2
years with symptoms below the threshold for a full major depressive
episode.

**With intermittent major depressive episodes, without current
episode:** Full criteria for a major depressive episode are not
currently met, but there has been one or more major depressive episodes
in at least the preceding 2 years.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is a
depressed mood that occurs for most of the day, for more days than not,
for at least 2 years, or at least 1 year for children and adolescents
(Criterion A). This disorder represents a consolidation of
DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder.
Major depression may precede persistent depressive disorder, and major
depressive episodes may occur during persistent depressive disorder.
Individuals whose symptoms meet major depressive disorder criteria for 2
years should be given a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder as
well as major depressive disorder.

Individuals with persistent depressive disorder describe their mood as
sad or "down in the dumps." During periods of depressed mood, at least
two of the six symptoms from Criterion B are present. Because these
symptoms have become a part of the individual's day-to-day experience,
particularly in the case of early onset (e.g., "I've always been this

[]{#index_split_025.html#p215}**170**

Depressive Disorders

way"), they may not be reported unless the individual is directly
prompted. During the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents),
any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months (Criterion C).

Prevalence

Persistent depressive disorder is effectively an amalgam of DSM-IV
dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive episode. The 12-month
prevalence in the United States is approximately 0.5% for persistent
depressive disorder and 1.5% for chronic major depressive disorder.

Development and Course

Persistent depressive disorder often has an early and insidious onset
(i.e., in childhood, adolescence, or early adult life) and, by
definition, a chronic course. Among individuals with both persistent
depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, the covari-ance
of the corresponding features over time suggests the operation of a
common mechanism. Early onset (i.e., before age 21 years) is associated
with a higher likelihood of comorbid personality disorders and substance
use disorders.

When symptoms rise to the level of a major depressive episode, they are
likely to subsequently revert to a lower level. However, depressive
symptoms are much less likely to resolve in a given period of time in
the context of persistent depressive disorder than they are in a major
depressive episode.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Factors predictive of poorer long-term outcome include higher levels of
neuroticism (negative affectivity), greater symptom severity, poorer
global functioning, and presence of anxiety disorders or conduct
disorder.

Environmental.

Childhood risk factors include parental loss or separation.

Genetic and physiological.

There are no clear differences in illness development, course, or family
history between DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive
disorder. Earlier findings pertaining to either disorder are therefore
likely to apply to persistent depressive disorder. It is thus likely
that individuals with persistent depressive disorder will have a higher
proportion of first-degree relatives with persistent depressive disorder
than do individuals with major depressive disorder, and more depressive
disorders in general.

A number of brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate,
amygdala, hippocampus) have been implicated in persistent depressive
disorder. Possible polysomnographic abnormalities exist as well.

Functional Consequences of

Persistent Depressive Disorder

The degree to which persistent depressive disorder impacts social and
occupational functioning is likely to vary widely, but effects can be as
great as or greater than those of major depressive disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Major depressive disorder.

If there is a depressed mood plus two or more symptoms meeting criteria
for a persistent depressive episode for 2 years or more, then the
diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is made. The diagnosis
depends on the 2-year duration, which distinguishes it from episodes of
depression that do not last 2 years. If the symptom

[]{#index_split_025.html#p216}Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

**171**

criteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at
any time during this period, then the diagnosis of major depression
should be noted, but it is coded not as a separate diagnosis but rather
as a specifier with the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. If
the individual's symptoms currently meet full criteria for a major
depressive episode, then the specifier of "with intermittent major
depressive episodes, with current episode" would be made. If the major
depressive episode has persisted for at least a 2-year duration and
remains present, then the specifier "with persistent major depressive
episode" is used. When full major depressive episode criteria are not
currently met but there has been at least one previous episode of major
depression in the context of at least 2 years of persistent depressive
symptoms, then the specifier of "with intermittent major depressive
episodes, without current episode" is used. If the individual has not
experienced an episode of major depression in the last 2 years, then the
specifier "with pure dysthymic syndrome" is used.

Psychotic disorders.

Depressive symptoms are a common associated feature of chronic psychotic
disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional
disorder). A separate diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is not
made if the symptoms occur only during the course of the psychotic
disorder (including residual phases).

Depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical
condition.

Persistent

depressive disorder must be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar
and related disorder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is
depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical
condition if the mood disturbance is judged, based on history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings, to be attributable to the direct
pathophysiological effects of a specific, usually chronic, medical
condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis). If it is judged that the
depressive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of
another medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (e.g.,
persistent depressive disorder) is recorded, and the medical condition
is noted as a concomitant medical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus).

Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder.

A substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar and related
disorder is distinguished from persistent depressive disorder when a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) is judged to be
etiologically related to the mood disturbance.

Personality disorders.

Often, there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance.

When an individual's presentation meets the criteria for both persistent
depressive disorder and a personality disorder, both diagnoses are
given.

Comorbidity

In comparison to individuals with major depressive disorder, those with
persistent depressive disorder are at higher risk for psychiatric
comorbidity in general, and for anxiety disorders and substance use
disorders in particular. Early-onset persistent depressive disorder is
strongly associated with DSM-IV Cluster B and C personality disorders.

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**625.4 (N94.3)**

A. In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be
present in the final week before the onset of menses, start to *improve*
within a few days after the onset of menses, and become *minimal* or
absent in the week postmenses.

B. One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present: 1. Marked
affective lability (e.g., mood swings; feeling suddenly sad or tearful,
or increased sensitivity to rejection).

[]{#index_split_025.html#p217}**172**

Depressive Disorders

2\. Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts.

3\. Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating
thoughts.

4\. Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on
edge.

C. One (or more) of the following symptoms must additionally be present,
to reach a total of *five* symptoms when combined with symptoms from
Criterion B above.

1\. Decreased interest in usual activities (e.g., work, school, friends,
hobbies).

2\. Subjective difficulty in concentration.

3\. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy.

4\. Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings.

5\. Hypersomnia or insomnia.

6\. A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control.

7\. Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or
muscle pain, a sensation of "bloating," or weight gain.

**Note:** The symptoms in Criteria A--C must have been met for most
menstrual cycles that occurred in the preceding year.

D. The symptoms are associated with clinically significant distress or
interference with work, school, usual social activities, or
relationships with others (e.g., avoidance of social activities;
decreased productivity and efficiency at work, school, or home).

E. The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of
another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder,
persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), or a personality disorder
(although it may co-occur with any of these disorders).

F. Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during
at least two symptomatic cycles. (**Note:** The diagnosis may be made
provisionally prior to this confirmation.) G. The symptoms are not
attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug
of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition
(e.g., hyperthyroidism).

Recording Procedures

If symptoms have not been confirmed by prospective daily ratings of at
least two symptomatic cycles, "provisional" should be noted after the
name of the diagnosis (i.e., "premenstrual dysphoric disorder,
provisional").

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of premenstrual dysphoric disorder are the
expression of mood lability, irritability, dysphoria, and anxiety
symptoms that occur repeatedly during the premenstrual phase of the
cycle and remit around the onset of menses or shortly thereafter.

These symptoms may be accompanied by behavioral and physical symptoms.
Symptoms must have occurred in most of the menstrual cycles during the
past year and must have an adverse effect on work or social functioning.
The intensity and/or expressivity of the accompanying symptoms may be
closely related to social and cultural background characteristics of the
affected female, family perspectives, and more specific factors such as
religious beliefs, social tolerance, and female gender role issues.

Typically, symptoms peak around the time of the onset of menses.
Although it is not uncommon for symptoms to linger into the first few
days of menses, the individual must have a symptom-free period in the
follicular phase after the menstrual period begins.

While the core symptoms include mood and anxiety symptoms, behavioral
and somatic symptoms commonly also occur. However, the presence of
physical and/or behavioral symptoms in the absence of mood and/or
anxious symptoms is not sufficient for a diag-

[]{#index_split_025.html#p218}Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

**173**

nosis. Symptoms are of comparable severity (but not duration) to those
of another mental disorder, such as a major depressive episode or
generalized anxiety disorder. In order to confirm a provisional
diagnosis, daily prospective symptom ratings are required for at least
two symptomatic cycles.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Delusions and hallucinations have been described in the late luteal
phase of the menstrual cycle but are rare. The premenstrual phase has
been considered by some to be a risk period for suicide.

Prevalence

Twelve-month prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is between
1.8% and 5.8%

of menstruating women. Estimates are substantially inflated if they are
based on retrospective reports rather than prospective daily ratings.
However, estimated prevalence based on a daily record of symptoms for
1--2 months may be less representative, as individuals with the most
severe symptoms may be unable to sustain the rating process. The most
rigorous estimate of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is 1.8% for women
whose symptoms meet the full criteria without functional impairment and
1.3% for women whose symptoms meet the current criteria with functional
impairment and without co-occurring symptoms from another mental
disorder.

Development and Course

Onset of premenstrual dysphoric disorder can occur at any point after
menarche. Incidence of new cases over a 40-month follow-up period is
2.5% (95% confidence interval =

1.7--3.7). Anecdotally, many individuals, as they approach menopause,
report that symptoms worsen. Symptoms cease after menopause, although
cyclical hormone replacement can trigger the re-expression of symptoms.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Environmental factors associated with the expression of premenstrual
dysphoric disorder include stress, history of interpersonal trauma,
seasonal changes, and sociocultural aspects of female sexual behavior in
general, and female gender role in particular.

Genetic and physiological.

Heritability of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is unknown.

However, for premenstrual symptoms, estimates for heritability range
between 30% and 80%, with the most stable component of premenstrual
symptoms estimated to be about 50% heritable.

Course modifiers.

Women who use oral contraceptives may have fewer premenstrual complaints
than do women who do not use oral contraceptives.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is not a culture-bound syndrome and has
been observed in individuals in the United States, Europe, India, and
Asia. It is unclear as to whether rates differ by race. Nevertheless,
frequency, intensity, and expressivity of symptoms and help-seeking
patterns may be significantly influenced by cultural factors.

Diagnostic Markers

As indicated earlier, the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder
is appropriately confirmed by 2 months of prospective symptom ratings. A
number of scales, including the

[]{#index_split_025.html#p219}**174**

Depressive Disorders

Daily Rating of Severity of Problems and the Visual Analogue Scales for
Premenstrual Mood Symptoms, have undergone validation and are commonly
used in clinical trials for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The
Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Rating Scale has a self-report and an
observer version, both of which have been validated and used widely to
measure illness severity in women who have premenstrual dysphoric
disorder.

Functional Consequences of

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

Symptoms must be associated with clinically meaningful distress and/or
an obvious and marked impairment in the ability to function socially or
occupationally in the week prior to menses. Impairment in social
functioning may be manifested by marital discord and problems with
children, other family members, or friends. Chronic marital or job
problems should not be confused with dysfunction that occurs only in
association with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Premenstrual syndrome.

Premenstrual syndrome differs from premenstrual dysphoric disorder in
that a minimum of five symptoms is not required, and there is no
stipulation of affective symptoms for individuals who have premenstrual
syndrome. This condition may be more common than premenstrual dysphoric
disorder, although the estimated prevalence of premenstrual syndrome
varies. While premenstrual syndrome shares the feature of symptom
expression during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, it is
generally considered to be less severe than premenstrual dysphoric
disorder. The presence of physical or behavioral symptoms in the
premenstruum, without the required affective symptoms, likely meets
criteria for premenstrual syndrome and not for premenstrual dysphoric
disorder.

Dysmenorrhea.

Dysmenorrhea is a syndrome of painful menses, but this is distinct from
a syndrome characterized by affective changes. Moreover, symptoms of
dysmenorrhea begin with the onset of menses, whereas symptoms of
premenstrual dysphoric disorder, by definition, begin before the onset
of menses, even if they linger into the first few days of menses.

Bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and persistent depressive
disorder (dysthymia).

Many women with (either naturally occurring or
substance/medication-induced) bipolar or major depressive disorder or
persistent depressive disorder believe that they have premenstrual
dysphoric disorder. However, when they chart symptoms, they realize that
the symptoms do not follow a premenstrual pattern. Women with another
mental disorder may experience chronic symptoms or intermittent symptoms
that are unrelated to menstrual cycle phase. However, because the onset
of menses constitutes a memorable event, they may report that symptoms
occur only during the premenstruum or that symptoms worsen
premenstrually. This is one of the rationales for the requirement that
symptoms be confirmed by daily prospective ratings. The process of
differential diagnosis, particularly if the clinician relies on
retrospective symptoms only, is made more difficult because of the
overlap between symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and some
other diagnoses. The overlap of symptoms is particularly salient for
differentiating premenstrual dysphoric disorder from major depressive
episodes, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, and
borderline personality disorder. However, the rate of personality
disorders is no higher in individuals with premenstrual dysphoric
disorder than in those without the disorder.

Use of hormonal treatments.

Some women who present with moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms may
be using hormonal treatments, including hormonal contraceptives. If such
symptoms occur after initiation of exogenous hormone use, the symptoms

[]{#index_split_025.html#p220}Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive
Disorder **175**

may be due to the use of hormones rather than to the underlying
condition of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. If the woman stops
hormones and the symptoms disappear, this is consistent with
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.

Comorbidity

A major depressive episode is the most frequently reported previous
disorder in individuals presenting with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
A wide range of medical (e.g., migraine, asthma, allergies, seizure
disorders) or other mental disorders (e.g., depressive and bipolar
disorders, anxiety disorders, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders)
may worsen in the premenstrual phase; however, the absence of a
symptom-free period during the postmen-strual interval obviates a
diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These conditions are
better considered premenstrual exacerbation of a current mental or
medical disorder. Although the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric
disorder should not be assigned in situations in which an individual
only experiences a premenstrual exacerbation of another mental or
physical disorder, it can be considered in addition to the diagnosis of
another mental or physical disorder if the individual experiences
symptoms and changes in level of functioning that are characteristic of
premenstrual dysphoric disorder and markedly different from the symptoms
experienced as part of the ongoing disorder.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Depressive Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in
the clinical picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly
diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):

1\. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance
intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.

2\. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the
symptoms in Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that
is not substance/

medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent depressive disorder
could include the following:

The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month)
after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there
is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent
nonsubstance/medication-induced depressive disorder (e.g., a history of
recurrent nonsubstance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of
substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in
Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are
sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-induced depressive disorders are indicated in the
table below. Note that the ICD-10-

[]{#index_split_025.html#p221}**176**

Depressive Disorders

CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use
disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance
use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder,
the 4th position character is "1," and the clinician should record

"mild \[substance\] use disorder" before the substance-induced
depressive disorder (e.g.,

"mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder").
If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is
"2," and the clinician should record "moderate \[substance\] use
disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder," depending on the
severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid
substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), then the 4th position character is "9," and the clinician
should record only the substance-induced depressive disorder.

from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after,
withdrawal.

Recording Procedures

ICD-9-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced depressive disorder begins
with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is
presumed to be causing the depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is
selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on
the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes
(e.g., dexamethasone), the code for "other substance" should be used;
and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor
but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown
substance" should be used.

The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the
recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-induced
disorder and substance use disorder into a single

[]{#index_split_025.html#p222}Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive
Disorder **177**

code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance
use disorder. For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring
during withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the
diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset
during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use
disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphenidate-induced
depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal; 292.84
dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during
intoxication).

ICD-10-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced depressive disorder begins
with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is
presumed to be causing the depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is
selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on
the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use
disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
dexamethasone), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in
cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used.

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the substance-induced depressive disorder, followed by
the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset
during withdrawal). For example, in the case of depressive symptoms
occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder,
the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced
depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis
of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the
substance-induced depressive disorder occurs without a comorbid
substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g.,
F16.94

phencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during
intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use
disorder with methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset
during withdrawal; F19.94

dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during
intoxication).

Diagnostic Features

The diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced depressive
disorder include the symptoms of a depressive disorder, such as major
depressive disorder; however, the depressive symptoms are associated
with the ingestion, injection, or inhalation of a substance (e.g., drug
of abuse, toxin, psychotropic medication, other medication), and the
depressive symptoms persist beyond the expected length of physiological
effects, intoxication, or withdrawal period. As evidenced by clinical
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings, the relevant
depressive disorder should have developed during or within 1 month after
use of a substance that is capable of producing the depressive disorder
(Criterion B1). In addition, the diagnosis is not better explained by an
independent depressive disorder. Evidence of an independent depressive
disorder includes the depressive disorder preceded the onset of
ingestion or withdrawal from the substance; the depressive disorder
persists beyond a substantial period of time after the cessation of
substance use; or other evidence suggests the existence of an
independent nonsubstance/

medication-induced depressive disorder (Criterion C). This diagnosis
should not be made when symptoms occur exclusively during the course of
a delirium (Criterion D). The depressive disorder associated with the
substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal must cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion
E).

Some medications (e.g., stimulants, steroids, L-dopa, antibiotics,
central nervous system drugs, dermatological agents, chemotherapeutic
drugs, immunological agents)

[]{#index_split_025.html#p223}**178**

Depressive Disorders

can induce depressive mood disturbances. Clinical judgment is essential
to determine whether the medication is truly associated with inducing
the depressive disorder or whether a primary depressive disorder
happened to have its onset while the person was receiving the treatment.
For example, a depressive episode that developed within the first
several weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa (an antihypertensive agent)
in an individual with no history of major depressive disorder would
qualify for the diagnosis of medication-induced depressive disorder. In
some cases, a previously established condition (e.g., major depressive
disorder, recurrent) can recur while the individual is coincidentally
taking a medication that has the capacity to cause depressive symptoms
(e.g., L-dopa, oral contraceptives). In such cases, the clinician must
make a judgment as to whether the medication is causative in this
particular situation.

A substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from
a primary depressive disorder by considering the onset, course, and
other factors associated with the substance use. There must be evidence
from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
substance use, abuse, intoxication, or withdrawal prior to the onset of
the depressive disorder. The withdrawal state for some substances can be
relatively protracted, and thus intense depressive symptoms can last for
a long period after the cessation of substance use.

Prevalence

In a nationally representative U.S. adult population, the lifetime
prevalence of substance/

medication-induced depressive disorder is 0.26%.

Development and Course

A depressive disorder associated with the use of substance (i.e.,
alcohol, illicit drugs, or a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder
or another medical condition) must have its onset while the individual
is using the substance or during withdrawal, if there is a withdrawal
syndrome associated with the substance. Most often, the depressive
disorder has its onset within the first few weeks or 1 month of use of
the substance. Once the substance is discontinued, the depressive
symptoms usually remit within days to several weeks, depending on the
half-life of the substance/medication and the presence of a withdrawal
syndrome. If symptoms persist 4 weeks beyond the expected time course of
withdrawal of a particular substance/medication, other causes for the
depressive mood symptoms should be considered.

Although there are a few prospective controlled trials examining the
association of depressive symptoms with use of a medication, most
reports are from postmarketing surveillance studies, retrospective
observational studies, or case reports, making evidence of causality
difficult to determine. Substances implicated in medication-induced
depressive disorder, with varying degrees of evidence, include antiviral
agents (efavirenz), cardiovascular agents (clonidine, guanethidine,
methyldopa, reserpine), retinoic acid derivatives (isotretinoin),
antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anti-migraine agents (triptans),
antipsychotics, hormonal agents (corticosteroids, oral contraceptives,
gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, tamoxifen), smoking cessation
agents (varenicline), and immunological agents (interferon). However,
other potential substances continue to emerge as new compounds are
synthesized. A history of such substance use may help increase
diagnostic certainty.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Factors that appear to increase the risk of substance/medication-induced
depressive disorder can be conceptualized as pertaining to the specific
type of drug or to a group of individuals with underlying alcohol or
drug use disorders. Risk fac-

[]{#index_split_025.html#p224}Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive
Disorder **179**

tors common to all drugs include history of major depressive disorder,
history of drug-induced depression, and psychosocial stressors.

Environmental.

There are also risks factors pertaining to a specific type of medication
(e.g., increased immune activation prior to treatment for hepatitis C
associated with interferon-alfa-induced depression); high doses (greater
than 80 mg/day prednisone-equivalents) of corticosteroids or high plasma
concentrations of efavirenz; and high estrogen/

progesterone content in oral contraceptives.

Course modifiers.

In a representative U.S. adult population, compared with individuals
with major depressive disorder who did not have a substance use
disorder, individuals with substance-induced depressive disorder were
more likely to be male, to be black, to have at most a high school
diploma, to lack insurance, and to have lower family income.

They were also more likely to report higher family history of substance
use disorders and antisocial behavior, higher 12-month history of
stressful life events, and a greater number of DSM-IV major depressive
disorder criteria. They were more likely to report feelings of
worthlessness, insomnia/hypersomnia, and thoughts of death and suicide
attempts, but less likely to report depressed mood and parental loss by
death before age 18 years.

Diagnostic Markers

Determination of the substance of use can sometimes be made through
laboratory assays of the suspected substance in the blood or urine to
corroborate the diagnosis.

Suicide Risk

Drug-induced or treatment-emergent suicidality represents a marked
change in thoughts and behavior from the person's baseline, is usually
temporally associated with initiation of a substance, and must be
distinguished from the underlying primary mental disorders.

In regard to the treatment-emergent suicidality associated with
antidepressants, a U.S.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee considered
meta-analyses of 99,839 participants enrolled in 372 randomized clinical
trials of antidepressants in trials for mental disorders. The analyses
showed that when the data were pooled across all adult age groups, there
was no perceptible increased risk of suicidal behavior or ideation.
However, in age-stratified analyses, the risk for patients ages 18--24
years was elevated, albeit not significantly (odds ratio \[OR\] = 1.55;
95% confidence interval \[CI\] = 0.91--2.70). The FDA meta-analyses
reveal an absolute risk of suicide in patients taking investigational
antidepressants of 0.01%. In conclusion, suicide is clearly an extremely
rare treatment-emergent phenomenon, but the outcome of suicide was
serious enough to prompt the FDA to issue an expanded black-box warning
in 2007 regarding the importance of careful monitoring of
treatment-emergent suicidal ideation in patients receiving
antidepressants.

Differential Diagnosis

Substance intoxication and withdrawal.

Depressive symptoms occur commonly in substance intoxication and
substance withdrawal, and the diagnosis of the substance-specific
intoxication or withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the
symptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance-induced depressive
disorder should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal when the mood symptoms are sufficiently severe
to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, dysphoric mood
is a characteristic feature of cocaine withdrawal.
Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder should be diagnosed
instead of cocaine withdrawal only if the mood disturbance is
substantially more intense or longer lasting than what is usually
encountered with cocaine withdrawal and is sufficiently severe to be a
separate focus of attention and treatment.

[]{#index_split_025.html#p225}**180**

Depressive Disorders

Primary depressive disorder.

A substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from
a primary depressive disorder by the fact that a substance is judged to
be etiologically related to the symptoms, as described earlier (see
section "Development and Course" for this disorder).

Depressive disorder due to another medical condition.

Because individuals with other

medical conditions often take medications for those conditions, the
clinician must consider the possibility that the mood symptoms are
caused by the physiological consequences of the medical condition rather
than the medication, in which case depressive disorder due to another
medical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the primary
basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the
other medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or
discontinuation) may be needed to determine empirically whether the
medication is the causative agent. If the clinician has ascertained that
the disturbance is a function of both another medical condition and
substance use or withdrawal, both diagnoses (i.e., depressive disorder
due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced
depressive disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence
to determine whether the depressive symptoms are associated with
substance (including a medication) ingestion or withdrawal or with
another medical condition or are primary (i.e., not a function of either
a substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other
specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder would
be indicated.

Comorbidity

Compared with individuals with major depressive disorder and no comorbid
substance use disorder, those with substance/medication-induced
depressive disorder have higher rates of comorbidity with any DSM-IV
mental disorder; are more likely to have specific DSM-IV disorders of
pathological gambling and paranoid, histrionic, and antisocial
personality disorders; and are less likely to have persistent depressive
disorder (dysthymia).

Compared with individuals with major depressive disorder and a comorbid
substance use disorder, individuals with substance/medication-induced
depressive disorder are more likely to have alcohol use disorder, any
other substance use disorder, and histrionic personality disorder;
however, they are less likely to have persistent depressive disorder.

Depressive Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

Diagnostic Criteria

A. A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly
diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities that
predominates in the clinical picture.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct
pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, in which the stressor
is a serious medical condition).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for depressive disorder due to
another medical condition is **293.83,** which is assigned regardless of
the specifier. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below).

[]{#index_split_025.html#p226}Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical
Condition **181**

*Specify* if:

**(F06.31) With depressive features:** Full criteria are not met for a
major depressive episode.

**(F06.32) With major depressive--like episode:** Full criteria are met
(except Criterion C) for a major depressive episode.

**(F06.34) With mixed features**: Symptoms of mania or hypomania are
also present but do not predominate in the clinical picture.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the
name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.83 \[F06.31\] depressive disorder
due to hypothyroidism, with depressive features). The other medical
condition should also be coded and listed separately immediately before
the depressive disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 244.9
\[E03.9\] hypothyroidism; 293.83 \[F06.31\] depressive disorder due to
hypothyroidism, with depressive features).

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of depressive disorder due to another medical
condition is a prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or
markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities that predominates in the clinical picture (Criterion A) and
that is thought to be related to the direct physiological effects of
another medical condition (Criterion B). In determining whether the mood
disturbance is due to a general medical condition, the clinician must
first establish the presence of a general medical condition. Further,
the clinician must establish that the mood disturbance is etiologically
related to the general medical condition through a physiological
mechanism. A careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is
necessary to make this judgment. Although there are no infallible
guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the mood
disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological, several
considerations provide some guidance in this area. One consideration is
the presence of a temporal association between the onset, exacerbation,
or remission of the general medical condition and that of the mood
disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of features that are
atypical of primary Mood Disorders (e.g., atypical age at onset or
course or absence of family history). Evidence from the literature that
suggests that there can be a direct association between the general
medical condition in question and the development of mood symptoms can
provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Etiology (i.e., a causal relationship to another medical condition based
on best clinical evidence) is the key variable in depressive disorder
due to another medical condition. The listing of the medical conditions
that are said to be able to induce major depression is never complete,
and the clinician's best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis.

There are clear associations, as well as some neuroanatomical
correlates, of depression with stroke, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's
disease, and traumatic brain injury. Among the neuroendocrine conditions
most closely associated with depression are Cushing's disease and
hypothyroidism. There are numerous other conditions thought to be
associated with depression, such as multiple sclerosis. However, the
literature's support for a causal association is greater with some
conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, than
with others, for which the differential diagnosis may be adjustment
disorder, with depressed mood.

Development and Course

Following stroke, the onset of depression appears to be very acute,
occurring within 1 day or a few days of the cerebrovascular accident
(CVA) in the largest case series. However, in

[]{#index_split_025.html#p227}**182**

Depressive Disorders

some cases, onset of the depression is weeks to months following the
CVA. In the largest series, the duration of the major depressive episode
following stroke was 9--11 months on average. Similarly, in Huntington's
disease the depressive state comes quite early in the course of the
illness. With Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, it often
precedes the major motor impairments and cognitive impairments
associated with each condition.

This is more prominently the case for Huntington's disease, in which
depression is considered to be the first neuropsychiatric symptom. There
is some observational evidence that depression is less common as the
dementia of Huntington's disease progresses.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

The risk of acute onset of a major depressive disorder following a CVA
(within 1 day to a week of the event) appears to be strongly correlated
with lesion location, with greatest risk associated with left frontal
strokes and least risk apparently associated with right frontal lesions
in those individuals who present within days of the stroke. The
association with frontal regions and laterality is not observed in
depressive states that occur in the 2--6 months following stroke.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Gender differences pertain to those associated with the medical
condition (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus is more common in females;
stroke is somewhat more common in middle-age males compared with
females).

Diagnostic Markers

Diagnostic markers pertain to those associated with the medical
condition (e.g., steroid levels in blood or urine to help corroborate
the diagnosis of Cushing's disease, which can be associated with manic
or depressive syndromes).

Suicide Risk

There are no epidemiological studies that provide evidence to
differentiate the risk of suicide from a major depressive episode due to
another medical condition compared with the risk from a major depressive
episode in general. There are case reports of suicides in association
with major depressive episodes associated with another medical
condition.

There is a clear association between serious medical illnesses and
suicide, particularly shortly after onset or diagnosis of the illness.
Thus, it would be prudent to assume that the risk of suicide for major
depressive episodes associated with medical conditions is not less than
that for other forms of major depressive episode, and might even be
greater.

Functional Consequences of Depressive Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

Functional consequences pertain to those associated with the medical
condition. In general, it is believed, but not established, that a major
depressive episode induced by Cushing's disease will not recur if the
Cushing's disease is cured or arrested. However, it is also suggested,
but not established, that mood syndromes, including depressive and
manic/

hypomanic ones, may be episodic (i.e., recurring) in some individuals
with static brain injuries and other central nervous system diseases.

Differential Diagnosis

Depressive disorders not due to another medical condition.

Determination of whether

a medical condition accompanying a depressive disorder is causing the
disorder depends on a) the absence of an episode(s) of depressive
episodes prior to the onset of the medical

[]{#index_split_025.html#p228}Other Specified Depressive Disorder

**183**

condition, b) the probability that the associated medical condition has
a potential to promote or cause a depressive disorder, and c) a course
of the depressive symptoms shortly after the onset or worsening of the
medical condition, especially if the depressive symptoms remit near the
time that the medical disorder is effectively treated or remits.

Medication-induced depressive disorder.

An important caveat is that some medical conditions are treated with
medications (e.g., steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce
depressive or manic symptoms. In these cases, clinical judgment, based
on all the evidence in hand, is the best way to try to separate the most
likely and/or the most important of two etiological factors (i.e.,
association with the medical condition vs. a substance-induced
syndrome).

Adjustment disorders.

It is important to differentiate a depressive episode from an adjustment
disorder, as the onset of the medical condition is in itself a life
stressor that could bring on either an adjustment disorder or an episode
of major depression. The major differentiating elements are the
pervasiveness the depressive picture and the number and quality of the
depressive symptoms that the patient reports or demonstrates on the
mental status examination. The differential diagnosis of the associated
medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the
present manual.

Comorbidity

Conditions comorbid with depressive disorder due to another medical
condition are those associated with the medical conditions of
etiological relevance. It has been noted that delirium can occur before
or along with depressive symptoms in individuals with a variety of
medical conditions, such as Cushing's disease. The association of
anxiety symptoms, usually generalized symptoms, is common in depressive
disorders, regardless of cause.

Other Specified Depressive Disorder

**311 (F32.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a depressive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific depressive
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified depressive
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "short-duration
depressive episode").

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following:

1\. **Recurrent brief depression:** Concurrent presence of depressed
mood and at least four other symptoms of depression for 2--13 days at
least once per month (not associated with the menstrual cycle) for at
least 12 consecutive months in an individual whose presentation has
never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder and does
not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic
disorder.

2\. **Short-duration depressive episode (4--13 days):** Depressed affect
and at least four of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive
episode associated with clinically significant distress or impairment
that persists for more than 4 days, but less than 14 days, in an
individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other
depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or
residual criteria for any psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria
for recurrent brief depression.

3\. **Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms:** Depressed affect
and at least one of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive
episode associated with clinically

[]{#index_split_025.html#p229}**184**

Depressive Disorders

significant distress or impairment that persist for at least 2 weeks in
an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other
depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or
residual criteria for any psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria
for mixed anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms.

Unspecified Depressive Disorder

**311 (F32.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a depressive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
depressive disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific depressive disorder, and includes presentations for
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Specifiers for Depressive Disorders

*Specify* if:

**With anxious distress:** Anxious distress is defined as the presence
of at least two of the following symptoms during the majority of days of
a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder
(dysthymia):

1\. Feeling keyed up or tense.

2\. Feeling unusually restless.

3\. Difficulty concentrating because of worry.

4\. Fear that something awful may happen.

5\. Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or
herself.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Two symptoms.

**Moderate:** Three symptoms.

**Moderate-severe:** Four or five symptoms.

**Severe:** Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation.

**Note:** Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both
bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty
mental health settings. High levels of anxiety have been associated with
higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood
of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to
specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress
for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.

**With mixed features:**

A. At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present
nearly every day during the majority of days of a major depressive
episode: 1. Elevated, expansive mood.

2\. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.

3\. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.

4\. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.

5\. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at
work or school, or sexually).

[]{#index_split_025.html#p230}Specifiers for Depressive Disorders

**185**

6\. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high
potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained
buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, foolish business investments).

7\. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than
usual; to be contrasted with insomnia).

B. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from
the person's usual behavior.

C. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or
hypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.

D. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects
of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).

**Note:** Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have
been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of
bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.

As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this
specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to
treatment.

**With melancholic features:**

A. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the
current episode:

1\. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.

2\. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel
much better, even temporarily, when something good happens).

B. Three (or more) of the following:

1\. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound
despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood.

2\. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.

3\. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual
awakening).

4\. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.

5\. Significant anorexia or weight loss.

6\. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.

**Note:** The specifier "with melancholic features" is applied if these
features are present at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a
near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure, not merely a
diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reactivity of mood is
that even highly desired events are not associated with marked
brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it
brightens only partially (e.g., up to 20%--40% of normal for only
minutes at a time). The "distinct quality" of mood that is
characteristic of the "with melancholic features" specifier is
experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic
depressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more
severe, longer lasting, or present without a reason is not considered
distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always present and
are observable by others.

Melancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across
episodes in the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients,
as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to occur in milder than in
more severe major depressive episodes; and are more likely to occur in
those with psychotic features.

**With atypical features:** This specifier can be applied when these
features predominate during the majority of days of the current or most
recent major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder.

A. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or
potential positive events).

[]{#index_split_025.html#p231}**186**

Depressive Disorders

B. Two (or more) of the following:

1\. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.

2\. Hypersomnia.

3\. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).

4\. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not
limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant
social or occupational impairment.

C. Criteria are not met for "with melancholic features" or "with
catatonia" during the same episode.

**Note:** "Atypical depression" has historical significance (i.e.,
atypical in contradistinction to the more classical agitated,
"endogenous" presentations of depression that were the norm when
depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in
adolescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon or
unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply.

Mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with
positive events (e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others).
Mood may become euthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of time if
the external circumstances remain favorable.

Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food
intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended
period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10
hours of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more than when not
depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or
weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally
present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a
time. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological sensitivity to
perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and
persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs
both when the person is and is not depressed, though it may be
exacerbated during depressive periods.

**With psychotic features:** Delusions and/or hallucinations are
present.

**With mood-congruent psychotic features:** The content of all delusions
and hallucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of
personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved
punishment.

**With mood-incongruent psychotic features:** The content of the
delusions or hallucinations does not involve typical depressive themes
of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved
punishment, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and
mood-congruent themes.

**With catatonia:** The catatonia specifier can apply to an episode of
depression if catatonic features are present during most of the episode.
See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental disorder (for a
description of catatonia, see the chapter

"Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders").

**With peripartum onset:** This specifier can be applied to the current
or, if full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive
episode, most recent episode of major depression if onset of mood
symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery.

**Note:** Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or
postpartum.

Although the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up after
delivery, between 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of a
major depressive episode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months
following delivery. Fifty percent of "postpartum" major depressive
episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus, these episodes are
referred to collectively as *peripartum* episodes. Women with peripartum
major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic
[]{#index_split_025.html#p232}Specifiers for Depressive Disorders

**187**

attacks. Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety
symptoms during pregnancy, as well as the "baby blues," increase the
risk for a postpartum major depressive episode.

Peripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without
psychotic features. Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum
psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to
kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed, but psychotic
symptoms can also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes without such
specific delusions or hallucinations.

Postpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic
features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and
may be more common in primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes
with psychotic features is particularly increased for women with prior
postpartum mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior
history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially bipolar I
disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.

Once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the
risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%.
Postpartum episodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in
the postpartum period, which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of
awareness or attention. The postpartum period is unique with respect to
the degree of neuroendocrine alterations and psychosocial adjustments,
the potential impact of breast-feeding on treatment planning, and the
long-term implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder on
subsequent family planning.

**With seasonal pattern:** This specifier applies to recurrent major
depressive disorder.

A. There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of
major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder and a particular
time of the year (e.g., in the fall or winter).

**Note:** Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of
seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being
unemployed every winter).

B. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or
hypomania) also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g.,
depression disappears in the spring).

C. In the last 2 years, two major depressive episodes have occurred that
demonstrate the temporal seasonal relationships defined above and no
nonseasonal major depressive episodes have occurred during that same
period.

D. Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above) substantially
outnumber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have
occurred over the individual's lifetime.

**Note:** The specifier "with seasonal pattern" can be applied to the
pattern of major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder,
recurrent. The essential feature is the onset and remission of major
depressive episodes at characteristic times of the year.

In most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring.
Less commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive episodes. This
pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at
least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during
this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive episodes must
substantially outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the
individual's lifetime.

This specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern
is better explained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g.,
seasonal unemployment or school schedule). Major depressive episodes
that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by prominent
energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for
carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely
in recurrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders. However,
within the bipolar disorders group, a seasonal pattern appears to be
more likely in bipolar II disorder than
[]{#index_split_025.html#p233}**188**

Depressive Disorders

in bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic or
hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season.

The prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with
latitude, age, and sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age
is also a strong predictor of seasonality, with younger persons at
higher risk for winter depressive episodes.

*Specify* if:

**In partial remission:** Symptoms of the immediately previous major
depressive episode are present, but full criteria are not met, or there
is a period lasting less than 2 months without any significant symptoms
of a major depressive episode following the end of such an episode.

**In full remission:** During the past 2 months, no significant signs or
symptoms of the disturbance were present.

*Specify* current severity:

Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of
those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability.

**Mild:** Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the
diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but
manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or
occupational functioning.

**Moderate:** The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or
functional impairment are between those specified for "mild" and
"severe."

**Severe:** The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that
required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is
seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms markedly
interfere with social and occupational functioning.

[]{#index_split_025.html#p234}**Anxiety**

**Disorders**

Anxiety disorders include disorders that share features of excessive
fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. *Fear* is the
emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat, whereas
*anxiety* is anticipation of future threat. Obviously, these two states
overlap, but they also differ, with fear more often associated with
surges of autonomic arousal necessary for fight or flight, thoughts of
immediate danger, and escape behaviors, and anxiety more often
associated with muscle tension and vigilance in preparation for future
danger and cautious or avoidant behaviors. Sometimes the level of fear
or anxiety is reduced by pervasive avoidance behaviors. *Panic attacks*
feature prominently within the anxiety disorders as a particular type of
fear response. Panic attacks are not limited to anxiety disorders but
rather can be seen in other mental disorders as well.

The anxiety disorders differ from one another in the types of objects or
situations that induce fear, anxiety, or avoidance behavior, and the
associated cognitive ideation. Thus, while the anxiety disorders tend to
be highly comorbid with each other, they can be differentiated by close
examination of the types of situations that are feared or avoided and
the content of the associated thoughts or beliefs.

Anxiety disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety
by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate
periods. They differ from transient fear or anxiety, often
stress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically lasting 6 months or
more), although the criterion for duration is intended as a general
guide with allowance for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of
shorter duration in children (as in separation anxiety disorder and
selective mutism). Since individuals with anxiety disorders typically
overestimate the danger in situations they fear or avoid, the primary
determination of whether the fear or anxiety is excessive or out of
proportion is made by the clinician, taking cultural contextual factors
into account. Many of the anxiety disorders develop in childhood and
tend to persist if not treated. Most occur more frequently in females
than in males (approximately 2:1 ratio). Each anxiety disorder is
diagnosed only when the symptoms are not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance/medication or to another medical
condition or are not better explained by another mental disorder.

The chapter is arranged developmentally, with disorders sequenced
according to the typical age at onset. The individual with separation
anxiety disorder is fearful or anxious about separation from attachment
figures to a degree that is developmentally inappropriate. There is
persistent fear or anxiety about harm coming to attachment figures and
events that could lead to loss of or separation from attachment figures
and reluctance to go away from attachment figures, as well as nightmares
and physical symptoms of distress. Although the symptoms often develop
in childhood, they can be expressed throughout adulthood as well.

Selective mutism is characterized by a consistent failure to speak in
social situations in which there is an expectation to speak (e.g.,
school) even though the individual speaks in other situations. The
failure to speak has significant consequences on achievement in academic
or occupational settings or otherwise interferes with normal social
communication.

Individuals with specific phobia are fearful or anxious about or
avoidant of circumscribed objects or situations. A specific cognitive
ideation is not featured in this disorder, as it is in other anxiety
disorders. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is almost always imme-189

[]{#index_split_025.html#p235}**190**

Anxiety Disorders

diately induced by the phobic situation, to a degree that is persistent
and out of proportion to the actual risk posed. There are various types
of specific phobias: animal; natural environment;
blood-injection-injury; situational; and other situations.

In social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the individual is fearful or
anxious about or avoidant of social interactions and situations that
involve the possibility of being scrutinized. These include social
interactions such as meeting unfamiliar people, situations in which the
individual may be observed eating or drinking, and situations in which
the individual performs in front of others. The cognitive ideation is of
being negatively evaluated by others, by being embarrassed, humiliated,
or rejected, or offending others.

In panic disorder, the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic
attacks and is persistently concerned or worried about having more panic
attacks or changes his or her behavior in maladaptive ways because of
the panic attacks (e.g., avoidance of exercise or of unfamiliar
locations). Panic attacks are abrupt surges of intense fear or intense
discomfort that reach a peak within minutes, accompanied by physical
and/or cognitive symptoms.

Limited-symptom panic attacks include fewer than four symptoms. Panic
attacks may be *expected,* such as in response to a typically feared
object or situation, or *unexpected,* meaning that the panic attack
occurs for no apparent reason. Panic attacks function as a marker and
prognostic factor for severity of diagnosis, course, and comorbidity
across an array of disorders, including, but not limited to, the anxiety
disorders (e.g., substance use, depressive and psychotic disorders).
Panic attack may therefore be used as a descriptive specifier for any
anxiety disorder as well as other mental disorders.

Individuals with agoraphobia are fearful and anxious about two or more
of the following situations: using public transportation; being in open
spaces; being in enclosed places; standing in line or being in a crowd;
or being outside of the home alone in other situations.

The individual fears these situations because of thoughts that escape
might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of
developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing
symptoms. These situations almost always induce fear or anxiety and are
often avoided and require the presence of a companion.

The key features of generalized anxiety disorder are persistent and
excessive anxiety and worry about various domains, including work and
school performance, that the individual finds difficult to control. In
addition, the individual experiences physical symptoms, including
restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge; being easily fatigued;
difficulty concentrating or mind going blank; irritability; muscle
tension; and sleep disturbance.

Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder involves anxiety due to
substance intoxication or withdrawal or to a medication treatment. In
anxiety disorder due to another medical condition, anxiety symptoms are
the physiological consequence of another medical condition.

Disorder-specific scales are available to better characterize the
severity of each anxiety disorder and to capture change in severity over
time. For ease of use, particularly for individuals with more than one
anxiety disorder, these scales have been developed to have the same
format (but different focus) across the anxiety disorders, with ratings
of behavioral symptoms, cognitive ideation symptoms, and physical
symptoms relevant to each disorder.

Separation Anxiety Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**309.21 (F93.0)**

A. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety
concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached, as
evidenced by at least three of the following: 1. Recurrent excessive
distress when anticipating or experiencing separation from home or from
major attachment figures.

[]{#index_split_025.html#p236}Separation Anxiety Disorder

**191**

2\. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures
or about possible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or
death.

3\. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event
(e.g., getting lost, being kidnapped, having an accident, becoming ill)
that causes separation from a major attachment figure.

4\. Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to
school, to work, or elsewhere because of fear of separation.

5\. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or
without major attachment figures at home or in other settings.

6\. Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to
sleep without being near a major attachment figure.

7\. Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.

8\. Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches,
stomachaches, nausea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment
figures occurs or is anticipated.

B. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4
weeks in children and adolescents and typically 6 months or more in
adults.

C. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder,
such as refusing to leave home because of excessive resistance to change
in autism spectrum disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning
separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go outside without a
trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other harm
befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or
concerns about having an illness in illness anxiety disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of separation anxiety disorder is excessive fear
or anxiety concerning separation from home or attachment figures. The
anxiety exceeds what may be expected given the person's developmental
level (Criterion A). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder have
symptoms that meet at least three of the following criteria: They
experience recurrent excessive distress when separation from home or
major attachment figures is anticipated or occurs (Criterion A1). They
worry about the well-being or death of attachment figures, particularly
when separated from them, and they need to know the whereabouts of their
attachment figures and want to stay in touch with them (Criterion A2).
They also worry about untoward events to themselves, such as getting
lost, being kidnapped, or having an accident, that would keep them from
ever being reunited with their major attachment figure (Criterion A3).
Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are reluctant or refuse to
go out by themselves because of separation fears (Criterion A4). They
have persistent and excessive fear or reluctance about being alone or
without major attachment figures at home or in other settings. Children
with separation anxiety disorder may be unable to stay or go in a room
by themselves and may display "clinging" behavior, staying close to or
"shadowing" the parent around the house, or requiring someone to be with
them when going to another room in the house (Criterion A5). They have
persistent reluctance or refusal to go to sleep without being near a
major attachment figure or to sleep away from home (Criterion A6).
Children with this disorder often have difficulty at bedtime and may
insist that someone stay with them until they fall asleep. During the
night, they may make their way to their parents' bed (or that of a
significant other, such as a sibling). Children may be reluctant or
refuse to attend camp, to sleep at friends' homes, or to go on errands.
Adults may be uncomfortable when traveling independently (e.g., sleeping
in a hotel room). There may be repeated nightmares in which the content
expresses the in-

[]{#index_split_025.html#p237}**192**

Anxiety Disorders

dividual's separation anxiety (e.g., destruction of the family through
fire, murder, or other catastrophe) (Criterion A7). Physical symptoms
(e.g., headaches, abdominal complaints, nausea, vomiting) are common in
children when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is
anticipated (Criterion A8). Cardiovascular symptoms such as
palpitations, dizziness, and feeling faint are rare in younger children
but may occur in adolescents and adults.

The disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in children
and adolescents younger than 18 years and is typically 6 months or
longer in adults (Criterion B). However, the duration criterion for
adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree
of flexibility. The disturbance must cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning (Criterion C).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

When separated from major attachment figures, children with separation
anxiety disorder may exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, sadness, or
difficulty concentrating on work or play. Depending on their age,
individuals may have fears of animals, monsters, the dark, muggers,
burglars, kidnappers, car accidents, plane travel, and other situations
that are perceived as presenting danger to the family or themselves.
Some individuals become homesick and uncomfortable to the point of
misery when away from home. Separation anxiety disorder in children may
lead to school refusal, which in turn may lead to academic difficulties
and social isolation. When extremely upset at the prospect of
separation, children may show anger or occasionally aggression toward
someone who is forcing separation. When alone, especially in the evening
or the dark, young children may report unusual perceptual experiences
(e.g., seeing people peering into their room, frightening creatures
reaching for them, feeling eyes staring at them). Children with this
disorder may be described as demanding, intrusive, and in need of
constant attention, and, as adults, may appear dependent and
overprotective. The individual's excessive demands often become a source
of frustration for family members, leading to resentment and conflict in
the family.

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalence of separation anxiety disorder among adults in
the United States is 0.9%--1.9%. In children, 6-to 12-month prevalence
is estimated to be approximately 4%.

In adolescents in the United States, the 12-month prevalence is 1.6%.
Separation anxiety disorder decreases in prevalence from childhood
through adolescence and adulthood and is the most prevalent anxiety
disorder in children younger than 12 years. In clinical samples of
children, the disorder is equally common in males and females. In the
community, the disorder is more frequent in females.

Development and Course

Periods of heightened separation anxiety from attachment figures are
part of normal early development and may indicate the development of
secure attachment relationships (e.g., around 1 year of age, when
infants may suffer from stranger anxiety). Onset of separation anxiety
disorder may be as early as preschool age and may occur at any time
during childhood and more rarely in adolescence. Typically there are
periods of exacerbation and remission. In some cases, both the anxiety
about possible separation and the avoidance of situations involving
separation from the home or nuclear family (e.g., going away to college,
moving away from attachment figures) may persist through adulthood.
However, the majority of children with separation anxiety disorder are
free of impairing anxiety disorders over their lifetimes. Many adults
with separation anxiety disorder do not recall a childhood onset of
separation anxiety disorder, although they may recall symptoms.

[]{#index_split_025.html#p238}Separation Anxiety Disorder

**193**

The manifestations of separation anxiety disorder vary with age. Younger
children are more reluctant to go to school or may avoid school
altogether. Younger children may not express worries or specific fears
of definite threats to parents, home, or themselves, and the anxiety is
manifested only when separation is experienced. As children age, worries
emerge; these are often worries about specific dangers (e.g., accidents,
kidnapping, mugging, death) or vague concerns about not being reunited
with attachment figures. In adults, separation anxiety disorder may
limit their ability to cope with changes in circumstances (e.g., moving,
getting married). Adults with the disorder are typically overconcerned
about their offspring and spouses and experience marked discomfort when
separated from them.

They may also experience significant disruption in work or social
experiences because of needing to continuously check on the whereabouts
of a significant other.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Separation anxiety disorder often develops after life stress, especially
a loss (e.g., the death of a relative or pet; an illness of the
individual or a relative; a change of schools; parental divorce; a move
to a new neighborhood; immigration; a disaster that involved periods of
separation from attachment figures). In young adults, other examples of
life stress include leaving the parental home, entering into a romantic
relationship, and becoming a parent. Parental overprotection and
intrusiveness may be associated with separation anxiety disorder.

Genetic and physiological.

Separation anxiety disorder in children may be heritable.

Heritability was estimated at 73% in a community sample of 6-year-old
twins, with higher rates in girls. Children with separation anxiety
disorder display particularly enhanced sensitivity to respiratory
stimulation using CO2-enriched air.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

There are cultural variations in the degree to which it is considered
desirable to tolerate separation, so that demands and opportunities for
separation between parents and children are avoided in some cultures.
For example, there is wide variation across countries and cultures with
respect to the age at which it is expected that offspring should leave
the parental home. It is important to differentiate separation anxiety
disorder from the high value some cultures place on strong
interdependence among family members.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Girls manifest greater reluctance to attend or avoidance of school than
boys. Indirect expression of fear of separation may be more common in
males than in females, for example, by limited independent activity,
reluctance to be away from home alone, or distress when spouse or
offspring do things independently or when contact with spouse or
offspring is not possible.

Suicide Risk

Separation anxiety disorder in children may be associated with an
increased risk for suicide. In a community sample, the presence of mood
disorders, anxiety disorders, or substance use has been associated with
suicidal ideation and attempts. However, this association is not
specific to separation anxiety disorder and is found in several anxiety
disorders.

Functional Consequences of Separation Anxiety Disorder Individuals with
separation anxiety disorder often limit independent activities away from
home or attachment figures (e.g., in children, avoiding school, not
going to camp, having

[]{#index_split_025.html#p239}**194**

Anxiety Disorders

difficulty sleeping alone; in adolescents, not going away to college; in
adults, not leaving the parental home, not traveling, not working
outside the home).

Differential Diagnosis

Generalized anxiety disorder.

Separation anxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety
disorder in that the anxiety predominantly concerns separation from
attachment figures, and if other worries occur, they do not predominate
the clinical picture.

Panic disorder.

Threats of separation may lead to extreme anxiety and even a panic
attack. In separation anxiety disorder, in contrast to panic disorder,
the anxiety concerns the possibility of being away from attachment
figures and worry about untoward events befalling them, rather than
being incapacitated by an unexpected panic attack.

Agoraphobia.

Unlike individuals with agoraphobia, those with separation anxiety
disorder are not anxious about being trapped or incapacitated in
situations from which escape is perceived as difficult in the event of
panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms.

Conduct disorder.

School avoidance (truancy) is common in conduct disorder, but anxiety
about separation is not responsible for school absences, and the child
or adolescent usually stays away from, rather than returns to, the home.

Social anxiety disorder.

School refusal may be due to social anxiety disorder (social phobia). In
such instances, the school avoidance is due to fear of being judged
negatively by others rather than to worries about being separated from
the attachment figures.

Posttraumatic stress disorder.

Fear of separation from loved ones is common after traumatic events such
as a disasters, particularly when periods of separation from loved ones
were experienced during the traumatic event. In posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), the central symptoms concern intrusions about, and
avoidance of, memories associated with the traumatic event itself,
whereas in separation anxiety disorder, the worries and avoidance
concern the well-being of attachment figures and separation from them.

Illness anxiety disorder.

Individuals with illness anxiety disorder worry about specific illnesses
they may have, but the main concern is about the medical diagnosis
itself, not about being separated from attachment figures.

Bereavement.

Intense yearning or longing for the deceased, intense sorrow and
emotional pain, and preoccupation with the deceased or the circumstances
of the death are expected responses occurring in bereavement, whereas
fear of separation from other attachment figures is central in
separation anxiety disorder.

Depressive and bipolar disorders.

These disorders may be associated with reluctance

to leave home, but the main concern is not worry or fear of untoward
events befalling attachment figures, but rather low motivation for
engaging with the outside world. However, individuals with separation
anxiety disorder may become depressed while being separated or in
anticipation of separation.

Oppositional defiant disorder.

Children and adolescents with separation anxiety disorder may be
oppositional in the context of being forced to separate from attachment
figures.

Oppositional defiant disorder should be considered only when there is
persistent oppositional behavior unrelated to the anticipation or
occurrence of separation from attachment figures.

Psychotic disorders.

Unlike the hallucinations in psychotic disorders, the unusual perceptual
experiences that may occur in separation anxiety disorder are usually
based on a misperception of an actual stimulus, occur only in certain
situations (e.g., nighttime), and are reversed by the presence of an
attachment figure.

[]{#index_split_025.html#p240}Selective Mutism

**195**

Personality disorders.

Dependent personality disorder is characterized by an indiscriminate
tendency to rely on others, whereas separation anxiety disorder involves
concern about the proximity and safety of main attachment figures.
Borderline personality disorder is characterized by fear of abandonment
by loved ones, but problems in identity, self-direction, interpersonal
functioning, and impulsivity are additionally central to that disorder,
whereas they are not central to separation anxiety disorder.

Comorbidity

In children, separation anxiety disorder is highly comorbid with
generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia. In adults, common
comorbidities include specific phobia, PTSD, panic disorder, generalized
anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and personality disorders. Depressive and
bipolar disorders are also comorbid with separation anxiety disorder in
adults.

Selective Mutism

Diagnostic Criteria

**313.23 (F94.0)**

A. Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which
there is an expectation for speaking (e.g., at school) despite speaking
in other situations.

B. The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational
achievement or with social communication.

C. The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to
the first month of school).

D. The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of,
or comfort with, the spoken language required in the social situation.

E. The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder
(e.g., childhood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively
during the course of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another
psychotic disorder.

Diagnostic Features

When encountering other individuals in social interactions, children
with selective mutism do not initiate speech or reciprocally respond
when spoken to by others. Lack of speech occurs in social interactions
with children or adults. Children with selective mutism will speak in
their home in the presence of immediate family members but often not
even in front of close friends or second-degree relatives, such as
grandparents or cousins.

The disturbance is often marked by high social anxiety. Children with
selective mutism often refuse to speak at school, leading to academic or
educational impairment, as teachers often find it difficult to assess
skills such as reading. The lack of speech may interfere with social
communication, although children with this disorder sometimes use
nonspoken or nonverbal means (e.g., grunting, pointing, writing) to
communicate and may be willing or eager to perform or engage in social
encounters when speech is not required (e.g., nonverbal parts in school
plays).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Associated features of selective mutism may include excessive shyness,
fear of social embarrassment, social isolation and withdrawal, clinging,
compulsive traits, negativism, temper tantrums, or mild oppositional
behavior. Although children with this disorder generally have normal
language skills, there may occasionally be an associated commu-

[]{#index_split_025.html#p241}**196**

Anxiety Disorders

nication disorder, although no particular association with a specific
communication disorder has been identified. Even when these disorders
are present, anxiety is present as well. In clinical settings, children
with selective mutism are almost always given an additional diagnosis of
another anxiety disorder---most commonly, social anxiety disorder
(social phobia).

Prevalence

Selective mutism is a relatively rare disorder and has not been included
as a diagnostic category in epidemiological studies of prevalence of
childhood disorders. Point prevalence using various clinic or school
samples ranges between 0.03% and 1% depending on the setting (e.g.,
clinic vs. school vs. general population) and ages of the individuals in
the sample.

The prevalence of the disorder does not seem to vary by sex or
race/ethnicity. The disorder is more likely to manifest in young
children than in adolescents and adults.

Development and Course

The onset of selective mutism is usually before age 5 years, but the
disturbance may not come to clinical attention until entry into school,
where there is an increase in social interaction and performance tasks,
such as reading aloud. The persistence of the disorder is variable.
Although clinical reports suggest that many individuals "outgrow"
selective mutism, the longitudinal course of the disorder is unknown. In
some cases, particularly in individuals with social anxiety disorder,
selective mutism may disappear, but symptoms of social anxiety disorder
remain.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Temperamental risk factors for selective mutism are not well identified.
Negative affectivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition may play a
role, as may parental history of shyness, social isolation, and social
anxiety. Children with selective mutism may have subtle receptive
language difficulties compared with their peers, although receptive
language is still within the normal range.

[]{#index_split_026.html}

Environmental.

Social inhibition on the part of parents may serve as a model for social
reticence and selective mutism in children. Furthermore, parents of
children with selective mutism have been described as overprotective or
more controlling than parents of children with other anxiety disorders
or no disorder.

Genetic and physiological factors.

Because of the significant overlap between selective

mutism and social anxiety disorder, there may be shared genetic factors
between these conditions.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Children in families who have immigrated to a country where a different
language is spoken may refuse to speak the new language because of lack
of knowledge of the language.

If comprehension of the new language is adequate but refusal to speak
persists, a diagnosis of selective mutism may be warranted.

Functional Consequences of Selective Mutism

Selective mutism may result in social impairment, as children may be too
anxious to engage in reciprocal social interaction with other children.
As children with selective mutism mature, they may face increasing
social isolation. In school settings, these children may suffer academic
impairment, because often they do not communicate with teachers
regarding their academic or personal needs (e.g., not understanding a
class assignment, not []{#index_split_026.html#p242}Specific Phobia

**197**

asking to use the restroom). Severe impairment in school and social
functioning, including that resulting from teasing by peers, is common.
In certain instances, selective mutism may serve as a compensatory
strategy to decrease anxious arousal in social encounters.

Differential Diagnosis

Communication disorders.

Selective mutism should be distinguished from speech disturbances that
are better explained by a communication disorder, such as language
disorder, speech sound disorder (previously phonological disorder),
childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), or pragmatic (social)
communication disorder. Unlike selective mutism, the speech disturbance
in these conditions is not restricted to a specific social situation.

Neurodevelopmental disorders and schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders.

Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia or another
psychotic disorder, or severe intellectual disability may have problems
in social communication and be unable to speak appropriately in social
situations. In contrast, selective mutism should be diagnosed only when
a child has an established capacity to speak in some social situations
(e.g., typically at home).

Social anxiety disorder (social phobia).

The social anxiety and social avoidance in social anxiety disorder may
be associated with selective mutism. In such cases, both diagnoses may
be given.

Comorbidity

The most common comorbid conditions are other anxiety disorders, most
commonly social anxiety disorder, followed by separation anxiety
disorder and specific phobia. Oppositional behaviors have been noted to
occur in children with selective mutism, although oppositional behavior
may be limited to situations requiring speech. Communication delays or
disorders also may appear in some children with selective mutism.

Specific Phobia

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g.,
flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood).

**Note:** In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying,
tantrums, freezing, or clinging.

B. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear
or anxiety.

C. The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with
intense fear or anxiety.

D. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed
by the specific object or situation and to the sociocultural context.

E. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for
6 months or more.

F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

G. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another
mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations
associated with panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms (as
in agoraphobia); objects or situations related to obsessions (as in
obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of traumatic events (as in
posttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or attachment
figures (as in separation anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in
social anxiety disorder).

**300.29 (F40.298) Other** (e.g., situations that may lead to choking or

**Coding note:** When more than one phobic stimulus is present, code all
ICD-10-CM codes that apply (e.g., for fear of snakes and flying, F40.218
specific phobia, animal, and F40.248 specific phobia, situational).

Specifiers

It is common for individuals to have multiple specific phobias. The
average individual with specific phobia fears three objects or
situations, and approximately 75% of individuals with specific phobia
fear more than one situation or object. In such cases, multiple specific
phobia diagnoses, each with its own diagnostic code reflecting the
phobic stimulus, would need to be given. For example, if an individual
fears thunderstorms and flying, then two diagnoses would be given:
specific phobia, natural environment, and specific phobia, situational.

Diagnostic Features

A key feature of this disorder is that the fear or anxiety is
circumscribed to the presence of a particular situation or object
(Criterion A), which may be termed the *phobic stimulus.* The categories
of feared situations or objects are provided as specifiers. Many
individuals fear objects or situations from more than one category, or
phobic stimulus. For the diagnosis of specific phobia, the response must
differ from normal, transient fears that commonly occur in the
population. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis, the fear or anxiety
must be intense or severe (i.e., "marked") (Criterion A). The amount of
fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared object or
situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of
the object or situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of
a full or limited symptom panic attack (i.e., expected panic attack).
Another characteristic of specific phobias is that fear or anxiety is
evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the
phobic stimulus (Criterion B). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious
only occasionally upon being confronted with the situation or object
(e.g., becomes anxious when flying only on one out of every five
airplane flights) would not be diagnosed with specific phobia. However,
the degree of fear or anxiety expressed may vary (from anticipatory
anxiety to a full panic attack) across different occasions of
encountering the phobic object or situation because of various
contextual factors such as the presence of others, duration of exposure,
and other threatening elements such as turbulence on a flight for
individuals who fear flying. Fear and anxiety are often expressed
differently between children and adults. Also, the fear or anxiety
occurs as soon as the phobic object or situation is encountered (i.e.,
immediately rather than being delayed).

The individual actively avoids the situation, or if he or she either is
unable or decides not to avoid it, the situation or object evokes
intense fear or anxiety (Criterion C). *Active* *avoidance* means the
individual intentionally behaves in ways that are designed to prevent or
minimize contact with phobic objects or situations (e.g., takes tunnels
instead of bridges on daily commute to work for fear of heights; avoids
entering a dark room for fear of spiders; avoids accepting a job in a
locale where a phobic stimulus is more common). Avoid-

[]{#index_split_026.html#p244}Specific Phobia

**199**

ance behaviors are often obvious (e.g., an individual who fears blood
refusing to go to the doctor) but are sometimes less obvious (e.g., an
individual who fears snakes refusing to look at pictures that resemble
the form or shape of snakes). Many individuals with specific phobias
have suffered over many years and have changed their living
circumstances in ways designed to avoid the phobic object or situation
as much as possible (e.g., an individual diagnosed with specific phobia,
animal, who moves to reside in an area devoid of the particular feared
animal). Therefore, they no longer experience fear or anxiety in their
daily life. In such instances, avoidance behaviors or ongoing refusal to
engage in activities that would involve exposure to the phobic object or
situation (e.g., repeated refusal to accept offers for work-related
travel because of fear of flying) may be helpful in confirming the
diagnosis in the absence of overt anxiety or panic.

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger that the
object or situation poses, or more intense than is deemed necessary
(Criterion D). Although individuals with specific phobia often recognize
their reactions as disproportionate, they tend to overestimate the
danger in their feared situations, and thus the judgment of being out of
proportion is made by the clinician. The individual's sociocultural
context should also be taken into account. For example, fears of the
dark may be reasonable in a context of ongoing violence, and fear of
insects may be more disproportionate in settings where insects are
consumed in the diet. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent,
typically lasting for 6 months or more (Criterion E), which helps
distinguish the disorder from transient fears that are common in the
population, particularly among children. However, the duration criterion
should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of
flexibility.

The specific phobia must cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning in order for the disorder to be diagnosed (Criterion F).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with specific phobia typically experience an increase in
physiological arousal in anticipation of or during exposure to a phobic
object or situation. However, the physiological response to the feared
situation or object varies. Whereas individuals with situational,
natural environment, and animal specific phobias are likely to show
sympathetic nervous system arousal, individuals with
blood-injection-injury specific phobia often demonstrate a vasovagal
fainting or near-fainting response that is marked by initial brief
acceleration of heart rate and elevation of blood pressure followed by a
deceleration of heart rate and a drop in blood pressure. Current neural
systems models for specific phobia emphasize the amygdala and related
structures, much as in other anxiety disorders.

Prevalence

In the United States, the 12-month community prevalence estimate for
specific phobia is approximately 7%--9%. Prevalence rates in European
countries are largely similar to those in the United States (e.g., about
6%), but rates are generally lower in Asian, African, and Latin American
countries (2%--4%). Prevalence rates are approximately 5% in children
and are approximately 16% in 13-to 17-year-olds. Prevalence rates are
lower in older individuals (about 3%--5%), possibly reflecting
diminishing severity to subclinical levels. Females are more frequently
affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1, although rates vary
across different phobic stimuli. That is, animal, natural environment,
and situational specific phobias are predominantly experienced by
females, whereas blood-injection-injury phobia is experienced nearly
equally by both genders.

Development and Course

Specific phobia sometimes develops following a traumatic event (e.g.,
being attacked by an animal or stuck in an elevator), observation of
others going through a traumatic event (e.g.,

[]{#index_split_026.html#p245}**200**

Anxiety Disorders

watching someone drown), an unexpected panic attack in the to be feared
situation (e.g., an unexpected panic attack while on the subway), or
informational transmission (e.g., extensive media coverage of a plane
crash). However, many individuals with specific phobia are unable to
recall the specific reason for the onset of their phobias. Specific
phobia usually develops in early childhood, with the majority of cases
developing prior to age 10

years. The median age at onset is between 7 and 11 years, with the mean
at about 10 years.

Situational specific phobias tend to have a later age at onset than
natural environment, animal, or blood-injection-injury specific phobias.
Specific phobias that develop in childhood and adolescence are likely to
wax and wane during that period. However, phobias that do persist into
adulthood are unlikely to remit for the majority of individuals.

When specific phobia is being diagnosed in children, two issues should
be considered.

First, young children may express their fear and anxiety by crying,
tantrums, freezing, or clinging. Second, young children typically are
not able to understand the concept of avoidance. Therefore, the
clinician should assemble additional information from parents, teachers,
or others who know the child well. Excessive fears are quite common in
young children but are usually transitory and only mildly impairing and
thus considered developmentally appropriate. In such cases a diagnosis
of specific phobia would not be made.

When the diagnosis of specific phobia is being considered in a child, it
is important to assess the degree of impairment and the duration of the
fear, anxiety, or avoidance, and whether it is typical for the child's
particular developmental stage.

Although the prevalence of specific phobia is lower in older
populations, it remains one of the more commonly experienced disorders
in late life. Several issues should be considered when diagnosing
specific phobia in older populations. First, older individuals may be
more likely to endorse natural environment specific phobias, as well as
phobias of falling. Second, specific phobia (like all anxiety disorders)
tends to co-occur with medical concerns in older individuals, including
coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Third,
older individuals may be more likely to attribute the symptoms of
anxiety to medical conditions. Fourth, older individuals may be more
likely to manifest anxiety in an atypical manner (e.g., involving
symptoms of both anxiety and depression) and thus be more likely to
warrant a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder. Additionally, the
presence of specific phobia in older adults is associated with decreased
quality of life and may serve as a risk factor for major neurocognitive
disorder.

Although most specific phobias develop in childhood and adolescence, it
is possible for a specific phobia to develop at any age, often as the
result of experiences that are traumatic. For example, phobias of
choking almost always follow a near-choking event at any age.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Temperamental risk factors for specific phobia, such as negative
affectivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition, are risk factors for
other anxiety disorders as well.

Environmental.

Environmental risk factors for specific phobias, such as parental
overprotectiveness, parental loss and separation, and physical and
sexual abuse, tend to predict other anxiety disorders as well. As noted
earlier, negative or traumatic encounters with the feared object or
situation sometimes (but not always) precede the development of specific
phobia.

Genetic and physiological.

There may be a genetic susceptibility to a certain category of specific
phobia (e.g., an individual with a first-degree relative with a specific
phobia of animals is significantly more likely to have the same specific
phobia than any other category of phobia). Individuals with
blood-injection-injury phobia show a unique propensity to vasovagal
syncope (fainting) in the presence of the phobic stimulus.

[]{#index_split_026.html#p246}Specific Phobia

**201**

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

In the United States, Asians and Latinos report significantly lower
rates of specific phobia than non-Latino whites, African Americans, and
Native Americans. In addition to having lower prevalence rates of
specific phobia, some countries outside of the United States,
particularly Asian and African countries, show differing phobia content,
age at onset, and gender ratios.

Suicide Risk

Individuals with specific phobia are up to 60% more likely to make a
suicide attempt than are individuals without the diagnosis. However, it
is likely that these elevated rates are primarily due to comorbidity
with personality disorders and other anxiety disorders.

Functional Consequences of Specific Phobia

Individuals with specific phobia show similar patterns of impairment in
psychosocial functioning and decreased quality of life as individuals
with other anxiety disorders and alcohol and substance use disorders,
including impairments in occupational and interpersonal functioning. In
older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties and volunteer
activities. Also, fear of falling in older adults can lead to reduced
mobility and reduced physical and social functioning, and may lead to
receiving formal or informal home support. The distress and impairment
caused by specific phobias tend to increase with the number of feared
objects and situations. Thus, an individual who fears four objects or
situations is likely to have more impairment in his or her occupational
and social roles and a lower quality of life than an individual who
fears only one object or situation.

Individuals with blood-injection-injury specific phobia are often
reluctant to obtain medical care even when a medical concern is present.
Additionally, fear of vomiting and choking may substantially reduce
dietary intake.

Differential Diagnosis

Agoraphobia.

Situational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia in its clinical
presentation, given the overlap in feared situations (e.g., flying,
enclosed places, elevators). If an individual fears only one of the
agoraphobia situations, then specific phobia, situational, may be
diagnosed. If two or more agoraphobic situations are feared, a diagnosis
of agoraphobia is likely warranted. For example, an individual who fears
airplanes and elevators (which overlap with the "public transportation"
agoraphobic situation) but does not fear other agoraphobic situations
would be diagnosed with specific phobia, situational, whereas an
individual who fears airplanes, elevators, and crowds (which overlap
with two agoraphobic situations, "using public transportation" and
"standing in line and or being in a crowd") would be diagnosed with
agoraphobia. Criterion B of agoraphobia (the situations are feared or
avoided "because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help
might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or
other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms") can also be useful in
differentiating agoraphobia from specific phobia. If the situations are
feared for other reasons, such as fear of being harmed directly by the
object or situations (e.g., fear of the plane crashing, fear of the
animal biting), a specific phobia diagnosis may be more appropriate.

Social anxiety disorder.

If the situations are feared because of negative evaluation, social
anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia.

Separation anxiety disorder.

If the situations are feared because of separation from a primary
caregiver or attachment figure, separation anxiety disorder should be
diagnosed instead of specific phobia.

[]{#index_split_026.html#p247}**202**

Anxiety Disorders

Panic disorder.

Individuals with specific phobia may experience panic attacks when
confronted with their feared situation or object. A diagnosis of
specific phobia would be given if the panic attacks only occurred in
response to the specific object or situation, whereas a diagnosis of
panic disorder would be given if the individual also experienced panic
attacks that were unexpected (i.e., not in response to the specific
phobia object or situation).

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

If an individual's primary fear or anxiety is of an object or situation
as a result of obsessions (e.g., fear of blood due to obsessive thoughts
about contamination from blood-borne pathogens \[i.e., HIV\]; fear of
driving due to obsessive images of harming others), and if other
diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder are met, then
obsessive-compulsive disorder should be diagnosed.

Trauma-and stressor-related disorders.

If the phobia develops following a traumatic

event, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be considered as a
diagnosis. However, traumatic events can precede the onset of PTSD and
specific phobia. In this case, a diagnosis of specific phobia would be
assigned only if all of the criteria for PTSD are not met.

Eating disorders.

A diagnosis of specific phobia is not given if the avoidance behavior is
exclusively limited to avoidance of food and food-related cues, in which
case a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa should be
considered.

Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

When the fear and avoidance

are due to delusional thinking (as in schizophrenia or other
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders), a diagnosis of
specific phobia is not warranted.

Comorbidity

Specific phobia is rarely seen in medical-clinical settings in the
absence of other psychopathology and is more frequently seen in
nonmedical mental health settings. Specific phobia is frequently
associated with a range of other disorders, especially depression in
older adults. Because of early onset, specific phobia is typically the
temporally primary disorder.

Individuals with specific phobia are at increased risk for the
development of other disorders, including other anxiety disorders,
depressive and bipolar disorders, substance-related disorders, somatic
symptom and related disorders, and personality disorders (particularly
dependent personality disorder).

Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.23 (F40.10)**

A. Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which
the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples
include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting
unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and
performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech).

**Note:** In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not
just during interactions with adults.

B. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety
symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or
embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others).

C. The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.

**Note:** In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying,
tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social
situations.

D. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or
anxiety.

[]{#index_split_026.html#p248}Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)
**203**

E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed
by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.

F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for
6 months or more.

G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

H. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication) or another medical condition.

I.

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms
of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic
disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.

J. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity,
disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or
avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.

*Specify* if:

**Performance only:** If the fear is restricted to speaking or
performing in public.

Specifiers

Individuals with the performance only type of social anxiety disorder
have performance fears that are typically most impairing in their
professional lives (e.g., musicians, dancers, performers, athletes) or
in roles that require regular public speaking. Performance fears may
also manifest in work, school, or academic settings in which regular
public presentations are required. Individuals with performance only
social anxiety disorder do not fear or avoid nonperformance social
situations.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of social anxiety disorder is a marked, or
intense, fear or anxiety of social situations in which the individual
may be scrutinized by others. In children the fear or anxiety must occur
in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults (Criterion
A). When exposed to such social situations, the individual fears that he
or she will be negatively evaluated. The individual is concerned that he
or she will be judged as anxious, weak, crazy, stupid, boring,
intimidating, dirty, or unlikable. The individual fears that he or she
will act or appear in a certain way or show anxiety symptoms, such as
blushing, trembling, sweating, stumbling over one's words, or staring,
that will be negatively evaluated by others (Criterion B). Some
individuals fear offending others or being rejected as a result. Fear of
offending others---for example, by a gaze or by showing anxiety
symptoms---may be the predominant fear in individuals from cultures with
strong collectivistic orientations. An individual with fear of trembling
of the hands may avoid drinking, eating, writing, or pointing in public;
an individual with fear of sweating may avoid shaking hands or eating
spicy foods; and an individual with fear of blushing may avoid public
performance, bright lights, or discussion about intimate topics. Some
individuals fear and avoid urinating in public restrooms when other
individuals are present (i.e., paruresis, or "shy bladder syndrome").

The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety (Criterion
C). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally in the
social situation(s) would not be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder.
However, the degree and type of fear and anxiety may vary (e.g.,
anticipatory anxiety, a panic attack) across different occasions. The
anticipatory anxiety may occur sometimes far in advance of upcoming
situations (e.g., worrying every day for weeks before attending a social
event, repeating a speech for days in advance).

In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums,
freezing, clinging, or shrinking in social situations. The individual
will often avoid the feared social situations.

Alternatively, the situations are endured with intense fear or anxiety
(Criterion D). Avoid-

[]{#index_split_026.html#p249}**204**

Anxiety Disorders

ance can be extensive (e.g., not going to parties, refusing school) or
subtle (e.g., overpre-paring the text of a speech, diverting attention
to others, limiting eye contact).

The fear or anxiety is judged to be out of proportion to the actual risk
of being negatively evaluated or to the consequences of such negative
evaluation (Criterion E). Sometimes, the anxiety may not be judged to be
excessive, because it is related to an actual danger (e.g., being
bullied or tormented by others). However, individuals with social
anxiety disorder often overestimate the negative consequences of social
situations, and thus the judgment of being out of proportion is made by
the clinician. The individual's sociocultural context needs to be taken
into account when this judgment is being made. For example, in certain
cultures, behavior that might otherwise appear socially anxious may be
considered appropriate in social situations (e.g., might be seen as a
sign of respect).

The duration of the disturbance is typically at least 6 months
(Criterion F). This duration threshold helps distinguish the disorder
from transient social fears that are common, particularly among children
and in the community. However, the duration criterion should be used as
a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The
fear, anxiety, and avoidance must interfere significantly with the
individual's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or
social activities or relationships, or must cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning (Criterion G). For example, an individual who is afraid
to speak in public would not receive a diagnosis of social anxiety
disorder if this activity is not routinely encountered on the job or in
classroom work, and if the individual is not significantly distressed
about it. However, if the individual avoids, or is passed over for, the
job or education he or she really wants because of social anxiety
symptoms, Criterion G is met.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with social anxiety disorder may be inadequately assertive
or excessively submissive or, less commonly, highly controlling of the
conversation. They may show overly rigid body posture or inadequate eye
contact, or speak with an overly soft voice. These individuals may be
shy or withdrawn, and they may be less open in conversations and
disclose little about themselves. They may seek employment in jobs that
do not require social contact, although this is not the case for
individuals with social anxiety disorder, performance only. They may
live at home longer. Men may be delayed in marrying and having a family,
whereas women who would want to work outside the home may live a life as
homemaker and mother. Self-medication with substances is common (e.g.,
drinking before going to a party). Social anxiety among older adults may
also include exacerbation of symptoms of medical illnesses, such as
increased tremor or tachycardia. Blushing is a hallmark physical
response of social anxiety disorder.

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalence estimate of social anxiety disorder for the
United States is approximately 7%. Lower 12-month prevalence estimates
are seen in much of the world using the same diagnostic instrument,
clustering around 0.5%--2.0%; median prevalence in Europe is 2.3%. The
12-month prevalence rates in children and adolescents are comparable to
those in adults. Prevalence rates decrease with age. The 12-month
prevalence for older adults ranges from 2% to 5%. In general, higher
rates of social anxiety disorder are found in females than in males in
the general population (with odds ratios ranging from 1.5 to 2.2), and
the gender difference in prevalence is more pronounced in adolescents
and young adults. Gender rates are equivalent or slightly higher for
males in clinical samples, and it is assumed that gender roles and
social expectations play a significant role in explaining the heightened
help-seeking behavior in male patients. Prevalence in the United States
is higher in American Indians and lower in persons of Asian, Latino,
African American, and Afro-Caribbean descent compared with non-Hispanic
whites.

[]{#index_split_026.html#p250}Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)
**205**

Development and Course

Median age at onset of social anxiety disorder in the United States is
13 years, and 75% of individuals have an age at onset between 8 and 15
years. The disorder sometimes emerges out of a childhood history of
social inhibition or shyness in U.S. and European studies. Onset can
also occur in early childhood. Onset of social anxiety disorder may
follow a stressful or humiliating experience (e.g., being bullied,
vomiting during a public speech), or it may be insidious, developing
slowly. First onset in adulthood is relatively rare and is more likely
to occur after a stressful or humiliating event or after life changes
that require new social roles (e.g., marrying someone from a different
social class, receiving a job promotion). Social anxiety disorder may
diminish after an individual with fear of dating marries and may
reemerge after divorce. Among individuals presenting to clinical care,
the disorder tends to be particularly persistent.

Adolescents endorse a broader pattern of fear and avoidance, including
of dating, compared with younger children. Older adults express social
anxiety at lower levels but across a broader range of situations,
whereas younger adults express higher levels of social anxiety for
specific situations. In older adults, social anxiety may concern
disability due to declining sensory functioning (hearing, vision) or
embarrassment about one's appearance (e.g., tremor as a symptom of
Parkinson's disease) or functioning due to medical conditions,
incontinence, or cognitive impairment (e.g., forgetting people's names).
In the community approximately 30% of individuals with social anxiety
disorder experience remission of symptoms within 1 year, and about 50%
experience remission within a few years. For approximately 60% of
individuals without a specific treatment for social anxiety disorder,
the course takes several years or longer.

Detection of social anxiety disorder in older adults may be challenging
because of several factors, including a focus on somatic symptoms,
comorbid medical illness, limited insight, changes to social environment
or roles that may obscure impairment in social functioning, or reticence
about describing psychological distress.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Underlying traits that predispose individuals to social anxiety disorder
include behavioral inhibition and fear of negative evaluation.

Environmental.

There is no causative role of increased rates of childhood maltreatment
or other early-onset psychosocial adversity in the development of social
anxiety disorder. However, childhood maltreatment and adversity are risk
factors for social anxiety disorder.

Genetic and physiological.

Traits predisposing individuals to social anxiety disorder, such as
behavioral inhibition, are strongly genetically influenced. The genetic
influence is subject to gene-environment interaction; that is, children
with high behavioral inhibition are more susceptible to environmental
influences, such as socially anxious modeling by parents. Also, social
anxiety disorder is heritable (but performance-only anxiety less so).

First-degree relatives have a two to six times greater chance of having
social anxiety disorder, and liability to the disorder involves the
interplay of disorder-specific (e.g., fear of negative evaluation) and
nonspecific (e.g., neuroticism) genetic factors.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The syndrome of *taijin kyofusho* (e.g., in Japan and Korea) is often
characterized by social-evaluative concerns, fulfilling criteria for
social anxiety disorder, that are associated with the fear that the
individual makes *other* people uncomfortable (e.g., "My gaze upsets
people so they look away and avoid me"), a fear that is at times
experienced with delusional intensity. This symptom may also be found in
non-Asian settings. Other presentations of *taijin kyofusho* may fulfill
criteria for body dysmorphic disorder or delusional disorder.

[]{#index_split_026.html#p251}**206**

Anxiety Disorders

Immigrant status is associated with significantly lower rates of social
anxiety disorder in both Latino and non-Latino white groups. Prevalence
rates of social anxiety disorder may not be in line with self-reported
social anxiety levels in the same culture---that is, societies with
strong collectivistic orientations may report high levels of social
anxiety but low prevalence of social anxiety disorder.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Females with social anxiety disorder report a greater number of social
fears and comorbid depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders, whereas
males are more likely to fear dating, have oppositional defiant disorder
or conduct disorder, and use alcohol and illicit drugs to relieve
symptoms of the disorder. Paruresis is more common in males.

Functional Consequences of Social Anxiety Disorder

Social anxiety disorder is associated with elevated rates of school
dropout and with decreased well-being, employment, workplace
productivity, socioeconomic status, and quality of life. Social anxiety
disorder is also associated with being single, unmarried, or divorced
and with not having children, particularly among men. In older adults,
there may be impairment in caregiving duties and volunteer activities.
Social anxiety disorder also impedes leisure activities. Despite the
extent of distress and social impairment associated with social anxiety
disorder, only about half of individuals with the disorder in Western
societies ever seek treatment, and they tend to do so only after 15--20
years of experiencing symptoms. Not being employed is a strong predictor
for the persistence of social anxiety disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Normative shyness.

Shyness (i.e., social reticence) is a common personality trait and is
not by itself pathological. In some societies, shyness is even evaluated
positively. However, when there is a significant adverse impact on
social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning, a
diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should be considered, and when full
diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder are met, the disorder
should be diagnosed. Only a minority (12%) of self-identified shy
individuals in the United States have symptoms that meet diagnostic
criteria for social anxiety disorder.

Agoraphobia.

Individuals with agoraphobia may fear and avoid social situations (e.g.,
going to a movie) because escape might be difficult or help might not be
available in the event of incapacitation or panic-like symptoms, whereas
individuals with social anxiety disorder are most fearful of scrutiny by
others. Moreover, individuals with social anxiety disorder are likely to
be calm when left entirely alone, which is often not the case in
agoraphobia.

Panic disorder.

Individuals with social anxiety disorder may have panic attacks, but the
concern is about fear of negative evaluation, whereas in panic disorder
the concern is about the panic attacks themselves.

Generalized anxiety disorder.

Social worries are common in generalized anxiety disorder, but the focus
is more on the nature of ongoing relationships rather than on fear of
negative evaluation. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder,
particularly children, may have excessive worries about the quality of
their social performance, but these worries also pertain to nonsocial
performance and when the individual is not being evaluated by others. In
social anxiety disorder, the worries focus on social performance and
others' evaluation.

Separation anxiety disorder.

Individuals with separation anxiety disorder may avoid social settings
(including school refusal) because of concerns about being separated
from attachment figures or, in children, about requiring the presence of
a parent when it is not developmentally appropriate. Individuals with
separation anxiety disorder are usually comfortable in social settings
when their attachment figure is present or when they are at

[]{#index_split_026.html#p252}Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)
**207**

home, whereas those with social anxiety disorder may be uncomfortable
when social situations occur at home or in the presence of attachment
figures.

Specific phobias.

Individuals with specific phobias may fear embarrassment or humiliation
(e.g., embarrassment about fainting when they have their blood drawn),
but they do not generally fear negative evaluation in other social
situations.

Selective mutism.

Individuals with selective mutism may fail to speak because of fear of
negative evaluation, but they do not fear negative evaluation in social
situations where no speaking is required (e.g., nonverbal play).

Major depressive disorder.

Individuals with major depressive disorder may be concerned about being
negatively evaluated by others because they feel they are bad or not
worthy of being liked. In contrast, individuals with social anxiety
disorder are worried about being negatively evaluated because of certain
social behaviors or physical symptoms.

Body dysmorphic disorder.

Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with one or
more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance that are
not observable or appear slight to others; this preoccupation often
causes social anxiety and avoidance. If their social fears and avoidance
are caused only by their beliefs about their appearance, a separate
diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is not warranted.

Delusional disorder.

Individuals with delusional disorder may have nonbizarre delusions
and/or hallucinations related to the delusional theme that focus on
being rejected by or offending others. Although extent of insight into
beliefs about social situations may vary, many individuals with social
anxiety disorder have good insight that their beliefs are out of
proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation.

Autism spectrum disorder.

Social anxiety and social communication deficits are hallmarks of autism
spectrum disorder. Individuals with social anxiety disorder typically
have adequate age-appropriate social relationships and social
communication capacity, although they may appear to have impairment in
these areas when first interacting with unfamiliar peers or adults.

Personality disorders.

Given its frequent onset in childhood and its persistence into and
through adulthood, social anxiety disorder may resemble a personality
disorder. The most apparent overlap is with avoidant personality
disorder. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder have a broader
avoidance pattern than those with social anxiety disorder.

Nonetheless, social anxiety disorder is typically more comorbid with
avoidant personality disorder than with other personality disorders, and
avoidant personality disorder is more comorbid with social anxiety
disorder than with other anxiety disorders.

Other mental disorders.

Social fears and discomfort can occur as part of schizophrenia, but
other evidence for psychotic symptoms is usually present. In individuals
with an eating disorder, it is important to determine that fear of
negative evaluation about eating disorder symptoms or behaviors (e.g.,
purging and vomiting) is not the sole source of social anxiety before
applying a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. Similarly,
obsessive-compulsive disorder may be associated with social anxiety, but
the additional diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is used only when
social fears and avoidance are independent of the foci of the obsessions
and compulsions.

Other medical conditions.

Medical conditions may produce symptoms that may be embarrassing (e.g.
trembling in Parkinson's disease). When the fear of negative evaluation
due to other medical conditions is excessive, a diagnosis of social
anxiety disorder should be considered.

Oppositional defiant disorder.

Refusal to speak due to opposition to authority figures should be
differentiated from failure to speak due to fear of negative evaluation.

Comorbidity

Social anxiety disorder is often comorbid with other anxiety disorders,
major depressive disorder, and substance use disorders, and the onset of
social anxiety disorder generally precedes that of the other disorders,
except for specific phobia and separation anxiety disorder. Chronic
social isolation in the course of a social anxiety disorder may result
in major depressive disorder. Comorbidity with depression is high also
in older adults. Substances may be used as self-medication for social
fears, but the symptoms of substance intoxication or withdrawal, such as
trembling, may also be a source of (further) social fear. Social anxiety
disorder is frequently comorbid with bipolar disorder or body dysmorphic
disorder; for example, an individual has body dysmorphic disorder
concerning a preoccupation with a slight irregularity of her nose, as
well as social anxiety disorder because of a severe fear of sounding
unintelligent. The more generalized form of social anxiety disorder, but
not social anxiety disorder, performance only, is often comorbid with
avoidant personality disorder. In children, comorbidities with
high-functioning autism and selective mutism are common.

Panic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.01 (F41.0)**

A. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge
of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within
minutes, and during which time four (or more) of the following symptoms
occur:

**Note:** The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious
state.

1\. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.

2\. Sweating.

3\. Trembling or shaking.

4\. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.

5\. Feelings of choking.

6\. Chest pain or discomfort.

7\. Nausea or abdominal distress.

8\. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint.

9\. Chills or heat sensations.

10\. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).

11\. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being
detached from oneself).

12\. Fear of losing control or "going crazy."

13\. Fear of dying.

**Note:** Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness,
headache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms
should not count as one of the four required symptoms.

B. At least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 month (or more) of
one or both of the following:

1\. Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their
consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, "going
crazy").

2\. A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks
(e.g., behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as
avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations).

[]{#index_split_026.html#p254}Panic Disorder

**209**

C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary disorders).

D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., the panic attacks do not occur only in response to feared social
situations, as in social anxiety disorder; in response to circumscribed
phobic objects or situations, as in specific phobia; in response to
obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder; in response to
reminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or
in response to separation from attachment figures, as in separation
anxiety disorder).

Diagnostic Features

*Panic disorder* refers to recurrent unexpected panic attacks (Criterion
A). A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense
discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which time
four or more of a list of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur.

The term *recurrent* literally means more than one unexpected panic
attack. The term *unexpected* refers to a panic attack for which there
is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of occurrence---that is, the
attack appears to occur from out of the blue, such as when the
individual is relaxing or emerging from sleep (nocturnal panic attack).
In contrast, *expected* panic attacks are attacks for which there is an
obvious cue or trigger, such as a situation in which panic attacks
typically occur. The determination of whether panic attacks are expected
or unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on
a combination of careful questioning as to the sequence of events
preceding or leading up to the attack and the individual's own judgment
of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for no apparent reason.
Cultural interpretations may influence the assignment of panic attacks
as expected or unexpected (see section "Culture-Related Diagnostic
Issues" for this disorder). In the United States and Europe,
approximately one-half of individuals with panic disorder have expected
panic attacks as well as unexpected panic attacks. Thus, the presence of
expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic
disorder. For more details regarding expected versus unexpected panic
attacks, see the text accompanying panic attacks (pp. 214--217).

The frequency and severity of panic attacks vary widely. In terms of
frequency, there may be moderately frequent attacks (e.g., one per week)
for months at a time, or short bursts of more frequent attacks (e.g.,
daily) separated by weeks or months without any attacks or with less
frequent attacks (e.g., two per month) over many years. Persons who have
infrequent panic attacks resemble persons with more frequent panic
attacks in terms of panic attack symptoms, demographic characteristics,
comorbidity with other disorders, family history, and biological data.
In terms of severity, individuals with panic disorder may have both
full-symptom (four or more symptoms) and limited-symptom (fewer than
four symptoms) attacks, and the number and type of panic attack symptoms
frequently differ from one panic attack to the next. However, more than
one unexpected full-symptom panic attack is required for the diagnosis
of panic disorder.

The worries about panic attacks or their consequences usually pertain to
physical concerns, such as worry that panic attacks reflect the presence
of life-threatening illnesses (e.g., cardiac disease, seizure disorder);
social concerns, such as embarrassment or fear of being judged
negatively by others because of visible panic symptoms; and concerns
about mental functioning, such as "going crazy" or losing control
(Criterion B). The maladaptive changes in behavior represent attempts to
minimize or avoid panic attacks or their consequences. Examples include
avoiding physical exertion, reorganizing daily life to ensure that help
is available in the event of a panic attack, restricting usual daily
activities, and avoiding agoraphobia-type situations, such as leaving
home, using public transportation, or shopping. If agoraphobia is
present, a separate diagnosis of agoraphobia is given.

[]{#index_split_026.html#p255}**210**

Anxiety Disorders

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

One type of unexpected panic attack is a *nocturnal* panic attack (i.e.,
waking from sleep in a state of panic, which differs from panicking
after fully waking from sleep). In the United States, this type of panic
attack has been estimated to occur at least one time in roughly
one-quarter to one-third of individuals with panic disorder, of whom the
majority also have daytime panic attacks. In addition to worry about
panic attacks and their consequences, many individuals with panic
disorder report constant or intermittent feelings of anxiety that are
more broadly related to health and mental health concerns. For example,
individuals with panic disorder often anticipate a catastrophic outcome
from a mild physical symptom or medication side effect (e.g., thinking
that they may have heart disease or that a headache means presence of a
brain tumor). Such individuals often are relatively intolerant of
medication side effects. In addition, there may be pervasive concerns
about abilities to complete daily tasks or withstand daily stressors,
excessive use of drugs (e.g., alcohol, prescribed medications or illicit
drugs) to control panic attacks, or extreme behaviors aimed at
controlling panic attacks (e.g., severe restrictions on food intake or
avoidance of specific foods or medications because of concerns about
physical symptoms that provoke panic attacks).

Prevalence

In the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate for panic
disorder across the United States and several European countries is
about 2%--3% in adults and adolescents. In the United States,
significantly lower rates of panic disorder are reported among Latinos,
African Americans, Caribbean blacks, and Asian Americans, compared with
non-Latino whites; American Indians, by contrast, have significantly
higher rates. Lower estimates have been reported for Asian, African, and
Latin American countries, ranging from 0.1%

to 0.8%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a rate of
approximately 2:1. The gender differentiation occurs in adolescence and
is already observable before age 14 years.

Although panic attacks occur in children, the overall prevalence of
panic disorder is low before age 14 years (\<0.4%). The rates of panic
disorder show a gradual increase during adolescence, particularly in
females, and possibly following the onset of puberty, and peak during
adulthood. The prevalence rates decline in older individuals (i.e., 0.7%
in adults over the age of 64), possibly reflecting diminishing severity
to subclinical levels.

Development and Course

The median age at onset for panic disorder in the United States is
20--24 years. A small number of cases begin in childhood, and onset
after age 45 years is unusual but can occur.

The usual course, if the disorder is untreated, is chronic but waxing
and waning. Some individuals may have episodic outbreaks with years of
remission in between, and others may have continuous severe
symptomatology. Only a minority of individuals have full remission
without subsequent relapse within a few years. The course of panic
disorder typically is complicated by a range of other disorders, in
particular other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and substance
use disorders (see section "Comorbidity" for this disorder).

Although panic disorder is very rare in childhood, first occurrence of
"fearful spells" is often dated retrospectively back to childhood. As in
adults, panic disorder in adolescents tends to have a chronic course and
is frequently comorbid with other anxiety, depressive, and bipolar
disorders. To date, no differences in the clinical presentation between
adolescents and adults have been found. However, adolescents may be less
worried about additional panic attacks than are young adults. Lower
prevalence of panic disorder in older adults appears to be attributable
to age-related "dampening" of the autonomic nervous system response.
Many older individuals with "panicky feelings" are observed to have a
"hybrid" of limited-symptom panic attacks and generalized anxiety. Also,
older adults

[]{#index_split_026.html#p256}Panic Disorder

**211**

tend to attribute their panic attacks to certain stressful situations,
such as a medical procedure or social setting. Older individuals may
retrospectively endorse explanations for the panic attack (which would
preclude the diagnosis of panic disorder), even if an attack might
actually have been unexpected in the moment (and thus qualify as the
basis for a panic disorder diagnosis). This may result in
under-endorsement of unexpected panic attacks in older individuals.
Thus, careful questioning of older adults is required to assess whether
panic attacks were expected before entering the situation, so that
unexpected panic attacks and the diagnosis of panic disorder are not
overlooked.

While the low rate of panic disorder in children could relate to
difficulties in symptom reporting, this seems unlikely given that
children are capable of reporting intense fear or panic in relation to
separation and to phobic objects or phobic situations. Adolescents might
be less willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks. Therefore,
clinicians should be aware that unexpected panic attacks do occur in
adolescents, much as they do in adults, and be attuned to this
possibility when encountering adolescents presenting with episodes of
intense fear or distress.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Negative affectivity (neuroticism) (i.e., proneness to experiencing
negative emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to
believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the
onset of panic attacks and, separately, for worry about panic, although
their risk status for the diagnosis of panic disorder is unknown.
History of "fearful spells" (i.e., limited-symptom attacks that do not
meet full criteria for a panic attack) may be a risk factor for later
panic attacks and panic disorder.

Although separation anxiety in childhood, especially when severe, may
precede the later development of panic disorder, it is not a consistent
risk factor.

Environmental.

Reports of childhood experiences of sexual and physical abuse are more
common in panic disorder than in certain other anxiety disorders.
Smoking is a risk factor for panic attacks and panic disorder. Most
individuals report identifiable stressors in the months before their
first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors and stressors related
to physical well-being, such as negative experiences with illicit or
prescription drugs, disease, or death in the family).

Genetic and physiological.

It is believed that multiple genes confer vulnerability to panic
disorder. However, the exact genes, gene products, or functions related
to the genetic regions implicated remain unknown. Current neural systems
models for panic disorder emphasize the amygdala and related structures,
much as in other anxiety disorders. There is an increased risk for panic
disorder among offspring of parents with anxiety, depressive, and
bipolar disorders. Respiratory disturbance, such as asthma, is
associated with panic disorder, in terms of past history, comorbidity,
and family history.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The rate of fears about mental and somatic symptoms of anxiety appears
to vary across cultures and may influence the rate of panic attacks and
panic disorder. Also, cultural expectations may influence the
classification of panic attacks as expected or unexpected. For example,
a Vietnamese individual who has a panic attack after walking out into a
windy environment ( *trúng gió;* "hit by the wind") may attribute the
panic attack to exposure to wind as a result of the cultural syndrome
that links these two experiences, resulting in classification of the
panic attack as expected. Various other cultural syndromes are
associated with panic disorder, including *ataque de nervios* ("attack
of nerves") among Latin Americans and *khyâl* attacks and "soul loss"
among Cambodians. *Ataque de nervios* may involve trembling,
uncontrollable screaming or crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and
depersonalization or derealization, which may be experienced longer than
the few minutes typical []{#index_split_026.html#p257}**212**

Anxiety Disorders

of panic attacks. Some clinical presentations of *ataque de nervios*
fulfill criteria for conditions other than panic attack (e.g., other
specified dissociative disorder). These syndromes impact the symptoms
and frequency of panic disorder, including the individual's attribution
of unexpectedness, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain
situations, ranging from interpersonal arguments (associated with
*ataque de nervios*), to types of exertion (associated with *khyâl*
attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with *trúng gió* attacks).

Clarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid in
distinguishing expected and unexpected panic attacks. For more
information regarding cultural syndromes, refer to the

"Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" in the Appendix.

The specific worries about panic attacks or their consequences are
likely to vary from one culture to another (and across different age
groups and gender). For panic disorder, U.S. community samples of
non-Latino whites have significantly less functional impairment than
African Americans. There are also higher rates of objectively defined
severity in non-Latino Caribbean blacks with panic disorder, and lower
rates of panic disorder overall in both African American and
Afro-Caribbean groups, suggesting that among individuals of African
descent, the criteria for panic disorder may be met only when there is
substantial severity and impairment.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

The clinical features of panic disorder do not appear to differ between
males and females.

There is some evidence for sexual dimorphism, with an association
between panic disorder and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene
in females only.

Diagnostic Markers

Agents with disparate mechanisms of action, such as sodium lactate,
caffeine, isoprotere-nol, yohimbine, carbon dioxide, and
cholecystokinin, provoke panic attacks in individuals with panic
disorder to a much greater extent than in healthy control subjects (and
in some cases, than in individuals with other anxiety, depressive, or
bipolar disorders without panic attacks). Also, for a proportion of
individuals with panic disorder, panic attacks are related to
hypersensitive medullary carbon dioxide detectors, resulting in
hypocapnia and other respiratory irregularities. However, none of these
laboratory findings are considered diagnostic of panic disorder.

Suicide Risk

Panic attacks and a diagnosis of panic disorder in the past 12 months
are related to a higher rate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation
in the past 12 months even when comorbidity and a history of childhood
abuse and other suicide risk factors are taken into account.

Functional Consequences of Panic Disorder

Panic disorder is associated with high levels of social, occupational,
and physical disability; considerable economic costs; and the highest
number of medical visits among the anxiety disorders, although the
effects are strongest with the presence of agoraphobia.

Individuals with panic disorder may be frequently absent from work or
school for doctor and emergency room visits, which can lead to
unemployment or dropping out of school.

In older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties or
volunteer activities. Full-symptom panic attacks typically are
associated with greater morbidity (e.g., greater health care
utilization, more disability, poorer quality of life) than
limited-symptom attacks.

Differential Diagnosis

Other specified anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder.

Panic disorder should

not be diagnosed if full-symptom (unexpected) panic attacks have never
been experienced. In

[]{#index_split_026.html#p258}Panic Disorder

**213**

the case of only limited-symptom unexpected panic attacks, an other
specified anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder diagnosis
should be considered.

Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.

Panic disorder is not diagnosed if

the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of
another medical condition. Examples of medical conditions that can cause
panic attacks include hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism,
pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure disorders, and
cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular
tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \[COPD\]).
Appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium levels for
hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or physical
examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in
determining the etiological role of another medical condition.

Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.

Panic disorder is not diagnosed if

the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of
a substance. Intoxication with central nervous system stimulants (e.g.,
cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine) or cannabis and withdrawal from central
nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates) can precipitate
a panic attack. However, if panic attacks continue to occur outside of
the context of substance use (e.g., long after the effects of
intoxication or withdrawal have ended), a diagnosis of panic disorder
should be considered. In addition, because panic disorder may precede
substance use in some individuals and may be associated with increased
substance use, especially for purposes of self-medication, a detailed
history should be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks
prior to excessive substance use. If this is the case, a diagnosis of
panic disorder should be considered in addition to a diagnosis of
substance use disorder. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the
presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss
of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech,
amnesia) suggest the possibility that another medical condition or a
substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.

Other mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated feature
(e.g., other anxiety disorders and psychotic disorders).

Panic attacks that occur as a symptom of other anxiety disorders are
expected (e.g., triggered by social situations in social anxiety
disorder, by phobic objects or situations in specific phobia or
agoraphobia, by worry in generalized anxiety disorder, by separation
from home or attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder) and thus
would not meet criteria for panic disorder. (**Note:** Sometimes an
unexpected panic attack is associated with the onset of another anxiety
disorder, but then the attacks become expected, whereas panic disorder
is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks.) If the panic
attacks occur only in response to specific triggers, then only the
relevant anxiety disorder is assigned. However, if the individual
experiences unexpected panic attacks as well and shows persistent
concern and worry or behavioral change because of the attacks, then an
additional diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered.

Comorbidity

Panic disorder infrequently occurs in clinical settings in the absence
of other psychopathology. The prevalence of panic disorder is elevated
in individuals with other disorders, particularly other anxiety
disorders (and especially agoraphobia), major depression, bipolar
disorder, and possibly mild alcohol use disorder. While panic disorder
often has an earlier age at onset than the comorbid disorder(s), onset
sometimes occurs after the comorbid disorder and may be seen as a
severity marker of the comorbid illness.

Reported lifetime rates of comorbidity between major depressive disorder
and panic disorder vary widely, ranging from 10% to 65% in individuals
with panic disorder. In approximately one-third of individuals with both
disorders, the depression precedes the onset of panic disorder. In the
remaining two-thirds, depression occurs coincident with or following the
onset of panic disorder. A subset of individuals with panic disorder
develop a substance-related disorder, which for some represents an
attempt to treat their anxiety []{#index_split_026.html#p259}**214**

Anxiety Disorders

with alcohol or medications. Comorbidity with other anxiety disorders
and illness anxiety disorder is also common.

Panic disorder is significantly comorbid with numerous general medical
symptoms and conditions, including, but not limited to, dizziness,
cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, asthma, COPD, and irritable bowel
syndrome. However, the nature of the association (e.g., cause and
effect) between panic disorder and these conditions remains unclear.
Although mitral valve prolapse and thyroid disease are more common among
individuals with panic disorder than in the general population, the
differences in prevalence are not consistent.

Panic Attack Specifier

 

**Note:** Symptoms are presented for the purpose of identifying a panic
attack; however, panic attack is not a mental disorder and cannot be
coded. Panic attacks can occur in the context of any anxiety disorder as
well as other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders,
posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders) and some medical
conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal).
When the presence of a panic attack is identified, it should be noted as
a specifier (e.g., "posttraumatic stress disorder with panic attacks").
For panic disorder, the presence of panic attack is contained within the
criteria for the disorder and panic attack is not used as a specifier.

An abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a
peak within minutes, and during which time four (or more) of the
following symptoms occur: **Note:** The abrupt surge can occur from a
calm state or an anxious state.

1\. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.

2\. Sweating.

3\. Trembling or shaking.

4\. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.

5\. Feelings of choking.

6\. Chest pain or discomfort.

7\. Nausea or abdominal distress.

8\. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint.

9\. Chills or heat sensations.

10\. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).

11\. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being
detached from oneself).

12\. Fear of losing control or "going crazy."

13\. Fear of dying.

**Note:** Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness,
headache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms
should not count as one of the four required symptoms.

Features

The essential feature of a panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense
fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and during
which time four or more of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur.
Eleven of these 13 symptoms are physical (e.g., palpitations, sweating),
while two are cognitive (i.e., fear of losing control or going crazy,
fear of dying). "Fear of going crazy" is a colloquialism often used by
individuals with panic attacks and is not intended as a pejorative or
diagnostic term. The term *within minutes* means that the time to peak
[]{#index_split_026.html#p260}Panic Attack Specifier

**215**

intensity is literally only a few minutes. A panic attack can arise from
either a calm state or an anxious state, and time to peak intensity
should be assessed independently of any preceding anxiety. That is, the
start of the panic attack is the point at which there is an abrupt
increase in discomfort rather than the point at which anxiety first
developed. Likewise, a panic attack can return to either an anxious
state or a calm state and possibly peak again. A panic attack is
distinguished from ongoing anxiety by its time to peak intensity, which
occurs within minutes; its discrete nature; and its typically greater
severity. Attacks that meet all other criteria but have fewer than four
physical and/or cognitive symptoms are referred to as *limited-symptom
attacks.*

There are two characteristic types of panic attacks: expected and
unexpected. *Expected* *panic attacks* are attacks for which there is an
obvious cue or trigger, such as situations in which panic attacks have
typically occurred. *Unexpected panic attacks* are those for which there
is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of occurrence (e.g., when
relaxing or out of sleep \[nocturnal panic attack\]). The determination
of whether panic attacks are expected or unexpected is made by the
clinician, who makes this judgment based on a combination of careful
questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the
attack and the individual's own judgment of whether or not the attack
seemed to occur for no apparent reason. Cultural interpretations may
influence their determination as expected or unexpected.
Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache,
uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen; however, such symptoms
should not count as one of the four required symptoms. Panic attacks can
occur in the context of any mental disorder (e.g., anxiety disorders,
depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, eating disorders,
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders,
psychotic disorders, substance use disorders) and some medical
conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal),
with the majority never meeting criteria for panic disorder. Recurrent
unexpected panic attacks are required for a diagnosis of panic disorder.

Associated Features

One type of unexpected panic attack is a *nocturnal panic attack* (i.e.,
waking from sleep in a state of panic), which differs from panicking
after fully waking from sleep. Panic attacks are related to a higher
rate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation even when comorbidity and
other suicide risk factors are taken into account.

Prevalence

In the general population, 12-month prevalence estimates for panic
attacks in the United States is 11.2% in adults. Twelve-month prevalence
estimates do not appear to differ significantly among African Americans,
Asian Americans, and Latinos. Lower 12-month prevalence estimates for
European countries appear to range from 2.7% to 3.3%. Females are more
frequently affected than males, although this gender difference is more
pronounced for panic disorder. Panic attacks can occur in children but
are relatively rare until the age of puberty, when the prevalence rates
increase. The prevalence rates decline in older individuals, possibly
reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels.

Development and Course

The mean age at onset for panic attacks in the United States is
approximately 22--23 years among adults. However, the course of panic
attacks is likely influenced by the course of any co-occurring mental
disorder(s) and stressful life events. Panic attacks are uncommon, and
unexpected panic attacks are rare, in preadolescent children.
Adolescents might be less willing than adults to openly discuss panic
attacks, even though they present with episodes of intense fear or
discomfort. Lower prevalence of panic attacks in older individuals may
be related to a weaker autonomic response to emotional states relative
to younger individuals. Older individuals may be less inclined to use
the word "fear" and more inclined []{#index_split_026.html#p261}**216**

Anxiety Disorders

to use the word "discomfort" to describe panic attacks. Older
individuals with "panicky feelings" may have a hybrid of limited-symptom
attacks and generalized anxiety. In addition, older individuals tend to
attribute panic attacks to certain situations that are stressful (e.g.,
medical procedures, social settings) and may retrospectively endorse
explanations for the panic attack even if it was unexpected in the
moment. This may result in under-endorsement of unexpected panic attacks
in older individuals.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Negative affectivity (neuroticism) (i.e., proneness to experiencing
negative emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to
believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the
onset of panic attacks. History of "fearful spells" (i.e.,
limited-symptom attacks that do not meet full criteria for a panic
attack) may be a risk factor for later panic attacks.

Environmental.

Smoking is a risk factor for panic attacks. Most individuals report
identifiable stressors in the months before their first panic attack
(e.g., interpersonal stressors and stressors related to physical
well-being, such as negative experiences with illicit or prescription
drugs, disease, or death in the family).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Cultural interpretations may influence the determination of panic
attacks as expected or unexpected. Culture-specific symptoms (e.g.,
tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, and uncontrollable screaming or
crying) may be seen; however, such symptoms should not count as one of
the four required symptoms. Frequency of each of the 13 symptoms varies
cross-culturally (e.g., higher rates of paresthesias in African
Americans and of dizziness in several Asian groups). Cultural syndromes
also influence the cross-cultural presentation of panic attacks,
resulting in different symptom profiles across different cultural
groups. Examples include *khyâl* (wind) attacks, a Cambodian cultural
syndrome involving dizziness, tinnitus, and neck soreness; and *trúng
gió* (wind-related) attacks, a Vietnamese cultural syndrome associated
with headaches. *Ataque de nervios* (attack of nerves) is a cultural
syndrome among Latin Americans that may involve trembling,
uncontrollable screaming or crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and
depersonalization or derealization, and which may be experienced for
longer than only a few minutes. Some clinical presentations of *ataque
de nervios* fulfill criteria for conditions other than panic attack
(e.g., other specified dissociative disorder). Also, cultural
expectations may influence the classification of panic attacks as
expected or unexpected, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain
situations, ranging from interpersonal arguments (associated with
*ataque de nervios*), to types of exertion (associated with *khyâl*
attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with *trúng gió* attacks).
Clarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid in
distinguishing expected and unexpected panic attacks. For more
information about cultural syndromes, see "Glossary of Cultural Concepts
of Distress" in the Appendix to this manual.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Panic attacks are more common in females than in males, but clinical
features or symptoms of panic attacks do not differ between males and
females.

Diagnostic Markers

Physiological recordings of naturally occurring panic attacks in
individuals with panic disorder indicate abrupt surges of arousal,
usually of heart rate, that reach a peak within minutes and subside
within minutes, and for a proportion of these individuals the panic
attack may be preceded by cardiorespiratory instabilities.

[]{#index_split_026.html#p262}Agoraphobia

**217**

Functional Consequences of Panic Attacks

In the context of co-occurring mental disorders, including anxiety
disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, substance use
disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders, panic attacks
are associated with increased symptom severity, higher rates of
comorbidity and suicidality, and poorer treatment response. Also,
full-symptom panic attacks typically are associated with greater
morbidity (e.g., greater health care utilization, more disability,
poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks.

Differential Diagnosis

Other paroxysmal episodes (e.g., "anger attacks").

Panic attacks should not be diagnosed if the episodes do not involve the
essential feature of an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense
discomfort, but rather other emotional states (e.g., anger, grief).

Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.

Medical conditions that can cause

or be misdiagnosed as panic attacks include hyperthyroidism,
hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure
disorders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias,
supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease). Appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium levels for
hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or physical
examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in
determining the etiological role of another medical condition.

Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.

Intoxication with central nervous

system stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine) or cannabis
and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol,
barbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack. A detailed history should
be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks prior to
excessive substance use. Features such as onset after age 45 years or
the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo,
loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech,
or amnesia) suggest the possibility that a medical condition or a
substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.

Panic disorder.

Repeated unexpected panic attacks are required but are not sufficient
for the diagnosis of panic disorder (i.e., full diagnostic criteria for
panic disorder must be met).

Comorbidity

Panic attacks are associated with increased likelihood of various
comorbid mental disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive
disorders, bipolar disorders, impulse-control disorders, and substance
use disorders. Panic attacks are associated with increased likelihood of
later developing anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar
disorders, and possibly other disorders.

Agoraphobia

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.22 (F40.00)**

A. Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the following five
situations: 1. Using public transportation (e.g., automobiles, buses,
trains, ships, planes).

2\. Being in open spaces (e.g., parking lots, marketplaces, bridges).

3\. Being in enclosed places (e.g., shops, theaters, cinemas).

4\. Standing in line or being in a crowd.

5\. Being outside of the home alone.

B. The individual fears or avoids these situations because of thoughts
that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the
event of developing panic-like symp-

[]{#index_split_026.html#p263}**218**

Anxiety Disorders

toms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear of
falling in the elderly; fear of incontinence).

C. The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.

D. The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the presence
of a companion, or are endured with intense fear or anxiety.

E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed
by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context.

F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for
6 months or more.

G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

H. If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease,
Parkinson's disease) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is
clearly excessive.

I.

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms
of another mental disorder---for example, the symptoms are not confined
to specific phobia, situational type; do not involve only social
situations (as in social anxiety disorder); and are not related
exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder),
perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance (as in body dysmorphic
disorder), reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress
disorder), or fear of separation (as in separation anxiety disorder).

**Note:** Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic
disorder. If an individual's presentation meets criteria for panic
disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses should be assigned.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of agoraphobia is marked, or intense, fear or
anxiety triggered by the real or anticipated exposure to a wide range of
situations (Criterion A). The diagnosis requires endorsement of symptoms
occurring in at least two of the following five situations: 1) using
public transporation, such as automobiles, buses, trains, ships, or
planes; 2) being in open spaces, such as parking lots, marketplaces, or
bridges; 3) being in enclosed spaces, such as shops, theaters, or
cinemas; 4) standing in line or being in a crowd; or 5) being outside of
the home alone. The examples for each situation are not exhaustive;
other situations may be feared. When experiencing fear and anxiety cued
by such situations, individuals typically experience thoughts that
something terrible might happen (Criterion B). Individuals frequently
believe that escape from such situations might be difficult (e.g.,
"can't get out of here") or that help might be unavailable (e.g., "there
is nobody to help me") when panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating
or embarrassing symptoms occur. "Panic-like symptoms" refer to any of
the 13 symptoms included in the criteria for panic attack, such as
dizziness, faintness, and fear of dying. "Other incapacitating or
embarrassing symptoms"

include symptoms such as vomiting and inflammatory bowel symptoms, as
well as, in older adults, a fear of falling or, in children, a sense of
disorientation and getting lost.

The amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared
situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of
the agoraphobic situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form
of a full-or limited-symptom panic attack (i.e., an expected panic
attack). Fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual
comes into contact with the feared situation (Criterion C). Thus, an
individual who becomes anxious only occasionally in an agoraphobic
situation (e.g., becomes anxious when standing in line on only one out
of every five occasions) would not be diagnosed with agoraphobia. The
individual actively avoids the situation or, if he or she either is
unable or decides not to avoid it, the situation evokes intense fear or
anxiety (Criterion D). *Active avoidance* means the individual is
currently behaving in ways that are intentionally designed to prevent or
minimize contact with agoraphobic situations. Avoidance can be
behavioral (e.g., changing []{#index_split_026.html#p264}Agoraphobia

**219**

daily routines, choosing a job nearby to avoid using public
transportation, arranging for food delivery to avoid entering shops and
supermarkets) as well as cognitive (e.g., using distraction to get
through agoraphobic situations) in nature. The avoidance can become so
severe that the person is completely homebound. Often, an individual is
better able to confront a feared situation when accompanied by a
companion, such as a partner, friend, or health professional.

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance must be out of proportion to the actual
danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural
context (Criterion E). Differentiating clinically significant
agoraphobic fears from reasonable fears (e.g., leaving the house during
a bad storm) or from situations that are deemed dangerous (e.g., walking
in a parking lot or using public transportation in a high-crime area) is
important for a number of reasons.

First, what constitutes avoidance may be difficult to judge across
cultures and sociocultural contexts (e.g., it is socioculturally
appropriate for orthodox Muslim women in certain parts of the world to
avoid leaving the house alone, and thus such avoidance would not be
considered indicative of agoraphobia). Second, older adults are likely
to overattribute their fears to age-related constraints and are less
likely to judge their fears as being out of proportion to the actual
risk. Third, individuals with agoraphobia are likely to overestimate
danger in relation to panic-like or other bodily symptoms. Agoraphobia
should be diagnosed only if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance persists
(Criterion F) and if it causes clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning (Criterion G). The duration of "typically lasting for 6
months or more" is meant to exclude individuals with short-lived,
transient problems. However, the duration criterion should be used as a
general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

In its most severe forms, agoraphobia can cause individuals to become
completely homebound, unable to leave their home and dependent on others
for services or assistance to provide even for basic needs.
Demoralization and depressive symptoms, as well as abuse of alcohol and
sedative medication as inappropriate self-medication strategies, are
common.

Prevalence

Every year approximately 1.7% of adolescents and adults have a diagnosis
of agoraphobia.

Females are twice as likely as males to experience agoraphobia.
Agoraphobia may occur in childhood, but incidence peaks in late
adolescence and early adulthood. Twelve-month prevalence in individuals
older than 65 years is 0.4%. Prevalence rates do not appear to vary
systematically across cultural/racial groups.

Development and Course

The percentage of individuals with agoraphobia reporting panic attacks
or panic disorder preceding the onset of agoraphobia ranges from 30% in
community samples to more than 50% in clinic samples. The majority of
individuals with panic disorder show signs of anxiety and agoraphobia
before the onset of panic disorder.

In two-thirds of all cases of agoraphobia, initial onset is before age
35 years. There is a substantial incidence risk in late adolescence and
early adulthood, with indications for a second high incidence risk phase
after age 40 years. First onset in childhood is rare. The overall mean
age at onset for agoraphobia is 17 years, although the age at onset
without preceding panic attacks or panic disorder is 25--29 years.

The course of agoraphobia is typically persistent and chronic. Complete
remission is rare (10%), unless the agoraphobia is treated. With more
severe agoraphobia, rates of full remission decrease, whereas rates of
relapse and chronicity increase. A range of other disorders, in
particular other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use
disorders, and personality disorders, may complicate the course of
agoraphobia. The long-term []{#index_split_026.html#p265}**220**

Anxiety Disorders

course and outcome of agoraphobia are associated with substantially
elevated risk of secondary major depressive disorder, persistent
depressive disorder (dysthymia), and substance use disorders.

The clinical features of agoraphobia are relatively consistent across
the lifespan, although the type of agoraphobic situations triggering
fear, anxiety, or avoidance, as well as the type of cognitions, may
vary. For example, in children, being outside of the home alone is the
most frequent situation feared, whereas in older adults, being in shops,
standing in line, and being in open spaces are most often feared. Also,
cognitions often pertain to becoming lost (in children), to experiencing
panic-like symptoms (in adults), to falling (in older adults).

The low prevalence of agoraphobia in children could reflect difficulties
in symptom reporting, and thus assessments in young children may require
solicitation of information from multiple sources, including parents or
teachers. Adolescents, particularly males, may be less willing than
adults to openly discuss agoraphobic fears and avoidance; however,
agoraphobia can occur prior to adulthood and should be assessed in
children and adolescents. In older adults, comorbid somatic symptom
disorders, as well as motor disturbances (e.g., sense of falling or
having medical complications), are frequently mentioned by individuals
as the reason for their fear and avoidance. In these instances, care is
to be taken in evaluating whether the fear and avoidance are out of
proportion to the real danger involved.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Behavioral inhibition and neurotic disposition (i.e., negative
affectivity

\[neuroticism\] and anxiety sensitivity) are closely associated with
agoraphobia but are relevant to most anxiety disorders (phobic
disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder). Anxiety
sensitivity (the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are
harmful) is also characteristic of individuals with agoraphobia.

Environmental.

Negative events in childhood (e.g., separation, death of parent) and
other stressful events, such as being attacked or mugged, are associated
with the onset of agoraphobia. Furthermore, individuals with agoraphobia
describe the family climate and child-rearing behavior as being
characterized by reduced warmth and increased overprotection.

Genetic and physiological.

Heritability for agoraphobia is 61%. Of the various phobias, agoraphobia
has the strongest and most specific association with the genetic factor
that represents proneness to phobias.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Females have different patterns of comorbid disorders than males.
Consistent with gender differences in the prevalence of mental
disorders, males have higher rates of comorbid substance use disorders.

Functional Consequences of Agoraphobia

Agoraphobia is associated with considerable impairment and disability in
terms of role functioning, work productivity, and disability days.
Agoraphobia severity is a strong determinant of the degree of
disability, irrespective of the presence of comorbid panic disorder,
panic attacks, and other comorbid conditions. More than one-third of
individuals with agoraphobia are completely homebound and unable to
work.

Differential Diagnosis

When diagnostic criteria for agoraphobia and another disorder are fully
met, both diagnoses should be assigned, unless the fear, anxiety, or
avoidance of agoraphobia is attributable to the other disorder.
Weighting of criteria and clinical judgment may be helpful in some
cases.

[]{#index_split_026.html#p266}Agoraphobia

**221**

Specific phobia, situational type.

Differentiating agoraphobia from situational specific phobia can be
challenging in some cases, because these conditions share several
symptom characteristics and criteria. Specific phobia, situational type,
should be diagnosed versus agoraphobia if the fear, anxiety, or
avoidance is limited to one of the agoraphobic situations.

Requiring fears from two or more of the agoraphobic situations is a
robust means for differentiating agoraphobia from specific phobias,
particularly the situational subtype. Additional differentiating
features include the cognitive ideation. Thus, if the situation is
feared for reasons other than panic-like symptoms or other
incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fears of being directly
harmed by the situation itself, such as fear of the plane crashing for
individuals who fear flying), then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be
more appropriate.

Separation anxiety disorder.

Separation anxiety disorder can be best differentiated from agoraphobia
by examining cognitive ideation. In separation anxiety disorder, the
thoughts are about detachment from significant others and the home
environment (i.e., parents or other attachment figures), whereas in
agoraphobia the focus is on panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating
or embarrassing symptoms in the feared situations.

Social anxiety disorder (social phobia).

Agoraphobia should be differentiated from social anxiety disorder based
primarily on the situational clusters that trigger fear, anxiety, or
avoidance and the cognitive ideation. In social anxiety disorder, the
focus is on fear of being negatively evaluated.

Panic disorder.

When criteria for panic disorder are met, agoraphobia should not be
diagnosed if the avoidance behaviors associated with the panic attacks
do not extend to avoidance of two or more agoraphobic situations.

Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.

Acute stress disorder and

posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be differentiated from
agoraphobia by examining whether the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is
related only to situations that remind the individual of a traumatic
event. If the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is restricted to trauma
reminders, and if the avoidance behavior does not extend to two or more
agoraphobic situations, then a diagnosis of agoraphobia is not
warranted.

Major depressive disorder.

In major depressive disorder, the individual may avoid leaving home
because of apathy, loss of energy, low self-esteem, and anhedonia. If
the avoidance is unrelated to fears of panic-like or other
incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms, then agoraphobia should not be
diagnosed.

Other medical conditions.

Agoraphobia is not diagnosed if the avoidance of situations is judged to
be a physiological consequence of a medical condition. This
determination is based on history, laboratory findings, and a physical
examination. Other relevant medical conditions may include
neurodegenerative disorders with associated motor disturbances (e.g.,
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis), as well as cardiovascular
disorders. Individuals with certain medical conditions may avoid
situations because of realistic concerns about being incapacitated
(e.g., fainting in an individual with transient ischemic attacks) or
being embarrassed (e.g., diarrhea in an individual with Crohn's
disease). The diagnosis of agoraphobia should be given only when the
fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that usually associated with
these medical conditions.

Comorbidity

The majority of individuals with agoraphobia also have other mental
disorders. The most frequent additional diagnoses are other anxiety
disorders (e.g., specific phobias, panic disorder, social anxiety
disorder), depressive disorders (major depressive disorder), PTSD, and
alcohol use disorder. Whereas other anxiety disorders (e.g., separation
anxiety disorder, specific phobias, panic disorder) frequently precede
onset of agoraphobia, depressive disorders and substance use disorders
typically occur secondary to agoraphobia.

[]{#index_split_026.html#p267}**222**

Anxiety Disorders

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.02 (F41.1)**

A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring
more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or
activities (such as work or school performance).

B. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.

C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the
following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present
for more days than not for the past 6 months):

**Note:** Only one item is required in children.

1\. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge.

2\. Being easily fatigued.

3\. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.

4\. Irritability.

5\. Muscle tension.

6\. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or
restless, unsatisfying sleep).

D. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).

F. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder,
negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder \[social phobia\],
contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder,
separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder,
reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining
weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom
disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having
a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of
delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of generalized anxiety disorder is excessive
anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) about a number of events or
activities. The intensity, duration, or frequency of the anxiety and
worry is out of proportion to the actual likelihood or impact of the
anticipated event. The individual finds it difficult to control the
worry and to keep worrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to
tasks at hand. Adults with generalized anxiety disorder often worry
about everyday, routine life circumstances, such as possible job
responsibilities, health and finances, the health of family members,
misfortune to their children, or minor matters (e.g., doing household
chores or being late for appointments). Children with generalized
anxiety disorder tend to worry excessively about their competence or the
quality of their performance. During the course of the disorder, the
focus of worry may shift from one concern to another.

Several features distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from
nonpathological anxiety.

First, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are
excessive and typically interfere significantly with psychosocial
functioning, whereas the worries of everyday life are not excessive and
are perceived as more manageable and may be put off when more pressing
matters arise. Second, the worries associated with generalized anxiety
disorder are

[]{#index_split_026.html#p268}Generalized Anxiety Disorder

**223**

more pervasive, pronounced, and distressing; have longer duration; and
frequently occur without precipitants. The greater the range of life
circumstances about which a person worries (e.g., finances, children's
safety, job performance), the more likely his or her symptoms are to
meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. Third, everyday worries
are much less likely to be accompanied by physical symptoms (e.g.,
restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge). Individuals with
generalized anxiety disorder report subjective distress due to constant
worry and related impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning.

The anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following
additional symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being
easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank,
irritability, muscle tension, and disturbed sleep, although only one
additional symptom is required in children.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Associated with muscle tension, there may be trembling, twitching,
feeling shaky, and muscle aches or soreness. Many individuals with
generalized anxiety disorder also experience somatic symptoms (e.g.,
sweating, nausea, diarrhea) and an exaggerated startle response.
Symptoms of autonomic hyperarousal (e.g., accelerated heart rate,
shortness of breath, dizziness) are less prominent in generalized
anxiety disorder than in other anxiety disorders, such as panic
disorder. Other conditions that may be associated with stress (e.g.,
irritable bowel syndrome, headaches) frequently accompany generalized
anxiety disorder.

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder is 0.9% among
adolescents and 2.9% among adults in the general community of the United
States. The 12-month prevalence for the disorder in other countries
ranges from 0.4% to 3.6%. The lifetime morbid risk is 9.0%. Females are
twice as likely as males to experience generalized anxiety disorder. The
prevalence of the diagnosis peaks in middle age and declines across the
later years of life.

Individuals of European descent tend to experience generalized anxiety
disorder more frequently than do individuals of non-European descent
(i.e., Asian, African, Native American and Pacific Islander).
Furthermore, individuals from developed countries are more likely than
individuals from nondeveloped countries to report that they have
experienced symptoms that meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder
in their lifetime.

Development and Course

Many individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report that they have
felt anxious and nervous all of their lives. The median age at onset for
generalized anxiety disorder is 30

years; however, age at onset is spread over a very broad range. The
median age at onset is later than that for the other anxiety disorders.
The symptoms of excessive worry and anxiety may occur early in life but
are then manifested as an anxious temperament. Onset of the disorder
rarely occurs prior to adolescence. The symptoms of generalized anxiety
disorder tend to be chronic and wax and wane across the lifespan,
fluctuating between syndromal and subsyndromal forms of the disorder.
Rates of full remission are very low.

The clinical expression of generalized anxiety disorder is relatively
consistent across the lifespan. The primary difference across age groups
is in the content of the individual's worry. Children and adolescents
tend to worry more about school and sporting performance, whereas older
adults report greater concern about the well-being of family or their
own physical heath. Thus, the content of an individual's worry tends to
be age appropriate. Younger adults experience greater severity of
symptoms than do older adults.

The earlier in life individuals have symptoms that meet criteria for
generalized anxiety disorder, the more comorbidity they tend to have and
the more impaired they are likely to

[]{#index_split_026.html#p269}**224**

Anxiety Disorders

be. The advent of chronic physical disease can be a potent issue for
excessive worry in the elderly. In the frail elderly, worries about
safety---and especially about falling---may limit activities. In those
with early cognitive impairment, what appears to be excessive worry
about, for example, the whereabouts of things is probably better
regarded as realistic given the cognitive impairment.

In children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder, the
anxieties and worries often concern the quality of their performance or
competence at school or in sporting events, even when their performance
is not being evaluated by others. There may be excessive concerns about
punctuality. They may also worry about catastrophic events, such as
earthquakes or nuclear war. Children with the disorder may be overly
conforming, per-fectionist, and unsure of themselves and tend to redo
tasks because of excessive dissatisfaction with less-than-perfect
performance. They are typically overzealous in seeking reassurance and
approval and require excessive reassurance about their performance and
other things they are worried about.

Generalized anxiety disorder may be overdiagnosed in children. When this
diagnosis is being considered in children, a thorough evaluation for the
presence of other childhood anxiety disorders and other mental disorders
should be done to determine whether the worries may be better explained
by one of these disorders. Separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety
disorder (social phobia), and obsessive-compulsive disorder are often
accompanied by worries that may mimic those described in generalized
anxiety disorder. For example, a child with social anxiety disorder may
be concerned about school performance because of fear of humiliation.
Worries about illness may also be better explained by separation anxiety
disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Behavioral inhibition, negative affectivity (neuroticism), and harm
avoidance have been associated with generalized anxiety disorder.

Environmental.

Although childhood adversities and parental overprotection have been
associated with generalized anxiety disorder, no environmental factors
have been identified as specific to generalized anxiety disorder or
necessary or sufficient for making the diagnosis.

Genetic and physiological.

One-third of the risk of experiencing generalized anxiety disorder is
genetic, and these genetic factors overlap with the risk of neuroticism
and are shared with other anxiety and mood disorders, particularly major
depressive disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

There is considerable cultural variation in the expression of
generalized anxiety disorder.

For example, in some cultures, somatic symptoms predominate in the
expression of the disorder, whereas in other cultures cognitive symptoms
tend to predominate. This difference may be more evident on initial
presentation than subsequently, as more symptoms are reported over time.
There is no information as to whether the propensity for excessive
worrying is related to culture, although the topic being worried about
can be culture specific. It is important to consider the social and
cultural context when evaluating whether worries about certain
situations are excessive.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

In clinical settings, generalized anxiety disorder is diagnosed somewhat
more frequently in females than in males (about 55%--60% of those
presenting with the disorder are female). In epidemiological studies,
approximately two-thirds are female. Females and males who experience
generalized anxiety disorder appear to have similar symptoms but

[]{#index_split_026.html#p270}Generalized Anxiety Disorder

**225**

demonstrate different patterns of comorbidity consistent with gender
differences in the prevalence of disorders. In females, comorbidity is
largely confined to the anxiety disorders and unipolar depression,
whereas in males, comorbidity is more likely to extend to the substance
use disorders as well.

Functional Consequences of

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Excessive worrying impairs the individual's capacity to do things
quickly and efficiently, whether at home or at work. The worrying takes
time and energy; the associated symptoms of muscle tension and feeling
keyed up or on edge, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and disturbed
sleep contribute to the impairment. Importantly the excessive worrying
may impair the ability of individuals with generalized anxiety disorder
to encourage confidence in their children.

Generalized anxiety disorder is associated with significant disability
and distress that is independent of comorbid disorders, and most
non-institutionalized adults with the disorder are moderately to
seriously disabled. Generalized anxiety disorder accounts for 110
million disability days per annum in the U.S. population.

Differential Diagnosis

Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.

The diagnosis of anxiety disorder

associated with another medical condition should be assigned if the
individual's anxiety and worry are judged, based on history, laboratory
findings, or physical examination, to be a physiological effect of
another specific medical condition (e.g., pheochromocytoma,
hyperthyroidism).

Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.

A substance/medication-induced

anxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder by
the fact that a substance or medication (e.g., a drug of abuse, exposure
to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the anxiety. For
example, severe anxiety that occurs only in the context of heavy coffee
consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced anxiety disorder.

Social anxiety disorder.

Individuals with social anxiety disorder often have anticipatory anxiety
that is focused on upcoming social situations in which they must perform
or be evaluated by others, whereas individuals with generalized anxiety
disorder worry, whether or not they are being evaluated.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Several features distinguish the excessive worry of

generalized anxiety disorder from the obsessional thoughts of
obsessive-compulsive disorder. In generalized anxiety disorder the focus
of the worry is about forthcoming problems, and it is the excessiveness
of the worry about future events that is abnormal. In
obsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessions are inappropriate ideas
that take the form of intrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images.

Posttraumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorders.

Anxiety is invariably present in posttraumatic stress disorder.
Generalized anxiety disorder is not diagnosed if the anxiety and worry
are better explained by symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.

Anxiety may also be present in adjustment disorder, but this residual
category should be used only when the criteria are not met for any other
disorder (including generalized anxiety disorder). Moreover, in
adjustment disorders, the anxiety occurs in response to an identifiable
stressor within 3 months of the onset of the stressor and does not
persist for more than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or
its consequences.

Depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders.

Generalized anxiety/worry is a common

associated feature of depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders and
should not be di-

[]{#index_split_026.html#p271}**226**

Anxiety Disorders

agnosed separately if the excessive worry has occurred only during the
course of these conditions.

Comorbidity

Individuals whose presentation meets criteria for generalized anxiety
disorder are likely to have met, or currently meet, criteria for other
anxiety and unipolar depressive disorders. The neuroticism or emotional
liability that underpins this pattern of comorbidity is associated with
temperamental antecedents and genetic and environmental risk factors
shared between these disorders, although independent pathways are also
possible. Comorbidity with substance use, conduct, psychotic,
neurodevelopmental, and neurocognitive disorders is less common.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Anxiety Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):

1\. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance
intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.

2\. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the
symptoms in Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by an anxiety disorder that
is not substance/

medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent anxiety disorder
could include the following:

The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month)
after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there
is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent
nonsubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder (e.g., a history of
recurrent nonsubstance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of
substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in
Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and they are
sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-induced anxiety disorders are indicated in the
table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM

code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use
disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance
use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety disorder,
the 4th position character is "1," and the clinician should record "mild
\[substance\] use disorder" before the substance-induced anxiety
disorder (e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced anxiety
disorder"). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character
is "2," and the clinician should record "moderate \[substance\] use
disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder," depending on the
severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid
substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-

[]{#index_split_026.html#p272}Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety
Disorder **227**

time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is
"9," and the clinician should record only the substance-induced anxiety
disorder.

*Specify* if (see Table 1 in the chapter "Substance-Related and
Addictive Disorders" for diagnoses associated with substance class):

**With onset during intoxication:** This specifier applies if criteria
are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop
during intoxication.

**With onset during withdrawal:** This specifier applies if criteria are
met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during,
or shortly after, withdrawal.

**With onset after medication use:** Symptoms may appear either at
initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use.

Recording Procedures

ICD-9-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder begins
with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbutamol) that is presumed
to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from
the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
salbutamol), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases
in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used.

The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset
during medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM,
which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder
into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for
the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms
occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use
disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder,
with onset during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.10 severe
lorazepam use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is
judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety
symptoms, each should be listed sep-

Anxiety Disorders

arately (e.g., 292.89 methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with
onset during intoxication; 292.89 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder,
with onset after medication use).

ICD-10-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder begins
with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbutamol) that is presumed
to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from
the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class
and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For
substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol),
the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases in which a
substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class
of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance" should be
used.

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the substance-induced anxiety disorder, followed by the
specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during
withdrawal, with onset during medication use). For example, in the case
of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe
lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13.280 severe lorazepam use
disorder with lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during
withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe lorazepam use
disorder is not given. If the substance-induced anxiety disorder occurs
without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy
use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted
(e.g., F16.980 psilocybin-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during
intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms, each should be
listed separately (e.g., F15.280 severe methylphenidate use disorder
with methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during
intoxication; F19.980 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset
after medication use).

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder
are prominent symptoms of panic or anxiety (Criterion A) that are judged
to be due to the effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication, or a toxin exposure). The panic or anxiety symptoms must
have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal
or after exposure to a medication, and the substances or medications
must be capable of producing the symptoms (Criterion B2).
Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder due to a prescribed
treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition must have
its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during
withdrawal, if a withdrawal is associated with the medication). Once the
treatment is discontinued, the panic or anxiety symptoms will usually
improve or remit within days to several weeks to a month (depending on
the half-life of the substance/medication and the presence of
withdrawal). The diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety
disorder should not be given if the onset of the panic or anxiety
symptoms precedes the substance/medication intoxication or withdrawal,
or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (i.e.,
usually longer than 1 month) from the time of severe intoxication or
withdrawal. If the panic or anxiety symptoms persist for substantial
periods of time, other causes for the symptoms should be considered.

The substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder diagnosis should be
made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance
withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A are predominant in the
clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent
clinical attention.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Panic or anxiety can occur in association with intoxication with the
following classes of substances: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis,
phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, inhalants, stimu-

[]{#index_split_026.html#p274}Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety
Disorder **229**

lants (including cocaine), and other (or unknown) substances. Panic or
anxiety can occur in association with withdrawal from the following
classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, and
anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown)
substances. Some medications that evoke anxiety symptoms include
anesthetics and analgesics, sympathomimetics or other bronchodilators,
anticholinergics, insulin, thyroid preparations, oral contraceptives,
antihistamines, antiparkinsonian medications, corticosteroids,
antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications, anticonvulsants,
lithium carbonate, antipsychotic medications, and antidepressant
medications. Heavy metals and toxins (e.g., organophosphate insecticide,
nerve gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, volatile substances such
as gasoline and paint) may also cause panic or anxiety symptoms.

Prevalence

The prevalence of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is not
clear. General population data suggest that it may be rare, with a
12-month prevalence of approximately 0.002%. However, in clinical
populations, the prevalence is likely to be higher.

Diagnostic Markers

Laboratory assessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be useful to measure
substance intoxication as part of an assessment for
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal.

Anxiety symptoms commonly occur in substance intoxication and substance
withdrawal. The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or
substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the
symptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced
anxiety disorder should be made in addition to substance intoxication or
substance withdrawal when the panic or anxiety symptoms are predominant
in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant
independent clinical attention. For example, panic or anxiety symptoms
are characteristic of alcohol withdrawal.

Anxiety disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance/medication).

Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is judged to be
etiologically related to the substance/medication.

Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from a
primary anxiety disorder based on the onset, course, and other factors
with respect to substances/medications. For drugs of abuse, there must
be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory
findings for use, intoxication, or withdrawal.
Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorders arise only in association
with intoxication or withdrawal states, whereas primary anxiety
disorders may precede the onset of substance/medication use. The
presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder,
such as atypical age at onset (e.g., onset of panic disorder after age
45 years) or symptoms (e.g., atypical panic attack symptoms such as true
vertigo, loss of balance, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder
control, headaches, slurred speech) may suggest a
substance/medication-induced etiology. A primary anxiety disorder
diagnosis is warranted if the panic or anxiety symptoms persist for a
substantial period of time (about 1 month or longer) after the end of
the substance intoxication or acute withdrawal or there is a history of
an anxiety disorder.

Delirium.

If panic or anxiety symptoms occur exclusively during the course of
delirium, they are considered to be an associated feature of the
delirium and are not diagnosed separately.

Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.

If the panic or anxiety symptoms

are attributed to the physiological consequences of another medical
condition (i.e., rather than to the medication taken for the medical
condition), anxiety disorder due to another

[]{#index_split_026.html#p275}**230**

Anxiety Disorders

medical condition should be diagnosed. The history often provides the
basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the
other medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or
discontinuation) may be needed to determine whether the medication is
the causative agent (in which case the symptoms may be better explained
by substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder). If the disturbance is
attributable to both another medical condition and substance use, both
diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder) may be given. When there
is insufficient evidence to determine whether the panic or anxiety
symptoms are attributable to a substance/medication or to another
medical condition or are primary (i.e., not attributable to either a
substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified
or unspecified anxiety disorder would be indicated.

Anxiety Disorder Due to

Another Medical Condition

Diagnostic Criteria

**293.84 (F06.4)**

A. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct
pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition within
the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.84 \[F06.4\] anxiety disorder
due to pheochromocytoma). The other medical condition should be coded
and listed separately immediately before the anxiety disorder due to the
medical condition (e.g., 227.0 \[D35.00\] pheochromocytoma; 293.84

\[F06.4\] anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of anxiety disorder due to another medical
condition is clinically significant anxiety that is judged to be best
explained as a physiological effect of another medical condition.
Symptoms can include prominent anxiety symptoms or panic attacks
(Criterion A).

The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated
physical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must
be judged that the symptoms are not better accounted for by another
mental disorder, in particular, adjustment disorder, with anxiety, in
which the stressor is the medical condition (Criterion C). In this case,
an individual with adjustment disorder is especially distressed about
the meaning or the consequences of the associated medical condition.

[]{#index_split_027.html}

By contrast, there is often a prominent physical component to the
anxiety (e.g., shortness of breath) when the anxiety is due to another
medical condition. The diagnosis is not made if the anxiety symptoms
occur only during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The anxiety
symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion
E).

In determining whether the anxiety symptoms are attributable to another
medical condition, the clinician must first establish the presence of
the medical condition. Furthermore, it must be established that anxiety
symptoms can be etiologically related to the medical condition through a
physiological mechanism before making a judgment that this is the best
explanation for the symptoms in a specific individual. A careful and
compre-

[]{#index_split_027.html#p276}Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical
Condition **231**

hensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this
judgment. Several aspects of the clinical presentation should be
considered: 1) the presence of a clear temporal association between the
onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the
anxiety symptoms; 2) the presence of features that are atypical of a
primary anxiety disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course); and 3)
evidence in the literature that a known physiological mechanism (e.g.,
hyperthyroidism) causes anxiety. In addition, the disturbance must not
be better explained by a primary anxiety disorder, a
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, or another primary mental
disorder (e.g., adjustment disorder).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A number of medical conditions are known to include anxiety as a
symptomatic manifestation. Examples include endocrine disease (e.g.,
hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia,
hyperadrenocortisolism), cardiovascular disorders (e.g., congestive
heart failure, pulmonary embolism, arrhythmia such as atrial
fibrillation), respiratory illness (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, asthma, pneumonia), metabolic disturbances (e.g., vitamin B12
deficiency, porphyria), and neurological illness (e.g., neoplasms,
vestibular dysfunction, encephalitis, seizure disorders). Anxiety due to
another medical condition is diagnosed when the medical condition is
known to induce anxiety and when the medical condition preceded the
onset of the anxiety.

Prevalence

The prevalence of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is
unclear. There appears to be an elevated prevalence of anxiety disorders
among individuals with a variety of medical conditions, including
asthma, hypertension, ulcers, and arthritis. However, this increased
prevalence may be due to reasons other than the anxiety disorder
directly causing the medical condition.

Development and Course

The development and course of anxiety disorder due to another medical
condition generally follows the course of the underlying illness. This
diagnosis is not meant to include primary anxiety disorders that arise
in the context of chronic medical illness. This is important to consider
with older adults, who may experience chronic medical illness and then
develop independent anxiety disorders secondary to the chronic medical
illness.

Diagnostic Markers

Laboratory assessments and/or medical examinations are necessary to
confirm the diagnosis of the associated medical condition.

Differential Diagnosis

Delirium.

A separate diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical
condition is not given if the anxiety disturbance occurs exclusively
during the course of a delirium.

However, a diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical
condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major
neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of anxiety is judged
to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing
the neurocognitive disorder and if anxiety is a prominent part of the
clinical presentation.

Mixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and anxiety).

If the presentation includes

a mix of different types of symptoms, the specific mental disorder due
to another medical condition depends on which symptoms predominate in
the clinical picture.

Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.

If there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including
medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from

[]{#index_split_027.html#p277}**232**

Anxiety Disorders

a substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance/medication-induced
anxiety disorder should be considered. Certain medications are known to
increase anxiety (e.g., corticosteroids, estrogens, metoclopramide), and
when this is the case, the medication may be the most likely etiology,
although it may be difficult to distinguish whether the anxiety is
attributable to the medications or to the medical illness itself. When a
diagnosis of substance-induced anxiety is being made in relation to
recreational or nonprescribed drugs, it may be useful to obtain a urine
or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation.

Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks of)
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be
especially indicative of a substance/medication-induced anxiety
disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the substance
used. If the disturbance is associated with both another medical
condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due
to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced anxiety
disorder) can be given. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the
presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss
of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech,
amnesia) suggest the possibility that another medical condition or a
substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.

Anxiety disorder (not due to a known medical condition).

Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be
distinguished from other anxiety disorders (especially panic disorder
and generalized anxiety disorder). In other anxiety disorders, no
specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with
another medical condition can be demonstrated. Late age at onset,
atypical symptoms, and the absence of a personal or family history of
anxiety disorders suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out
the diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.
Anxiety disorders can exacerbate or pose increased risk for medical
conditions such as cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction and
should not be diagnosed as anxiety disorder due to another medical
condition in these cases.

Illness anxiety disorder.

Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be
distinguished from illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is
characterized by worry about illness, concern about pain, and bodily
preoccupations. In the case of illness anxiety disorder, individuals may
or may not have diagnosed medical conditions. Although an individual
with illness anxiety disorder and a diagnosed medical condition is
likely to experience anxiety about the medical condition, the medical
condition is not physiologically related to the anxiety symptoms.

Adjustment disorders.

Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be
distinguished from adjustment disorders, with anxiety, or with anxiety
and depressed mood. Adjustment disorder is warranted when individuals
experience a maladaptive response to the stress of having another
medical condition. The reaction to stress usually concerns the meaning
or consequences of the stress, as compared with the experience of
anxiety or mood symptoms that occur as a physiological consequence of
the other medical condition. In adjustment disorder, the anxiety
symptoms are typically related to coping with the stress of having a
general medical condition, whereas in anxiety disorder due to another
medical condition, individuals are more likely to have prominent
physical symptoms and to be focused on issues other than the stress of
the illness itself.

Associated feature of another mental disorder.

Anxiety symptoms may be an associated feature of another mental disorder
(e.g., schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa).

Other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder.

This diagnosis is given if it cannot be

determined whether the anxiety symptoms are primary, substance-induced,
or associated with another medical condition.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p278}Other Specified Anxiety Disorder

**233**

Other Specified Anxiety Disorder

**300.09 (F41.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an anxiety disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The other specified
anxiety disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does
not meet the criteria for any specific anxiety disorder.

This is done by recording "other specified anxiety disorder" followed by
the specific reason (e.g., "generalized anxiety not occurring more days
than not").

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following:

1\. **Limited-symptom attacks.**

2\. **Generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not.**

3\. ***Khyâl cap*** **(wind attacks):** See "Glossary of Cultural
Concepts of Distress" in the Appendix.

4\. ***Ataque de nervios*** **(attack of nerves):** See "Glossary of
Cultural Concepts of Distress"

in the Appendix.

Unspecified Anxiety Disorder

**300.00 (F41.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an anxiety disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
anxiety disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses *not* to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a
specific anxiety disorder, and includes presentations in which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

[]{#index_split_027.html#p279} *This page intentionally left blank*

[]{#index_split_027.html#p280} **Obsessive-Compulsive and**

**Related Disorders**

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders include obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder,
trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking)
disorder, substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder, obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another
medical condition, and other specified obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder and unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
(e.g., body-focused repetitive behavior disorder, obsessional jealousy).

OCD is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions.
*Obsessions* are recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images
that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted, whereas *compulsions*
are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven
to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must
be applied rigidly. Some other obsessive-compulsive and related
disorders are also characterized by preoccupations and by repetitive
behaviors or mental acts in response to the preoccupations. Other
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are characterized primarily
by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., hair pulling, skin
picking) and repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviors.

The inclusion of a chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
in DSM-5 reflects the increasing evidence of these disorders'
relatedness to one another in terms of a range of diagnostic validators
as well as the clinical utility of grouping these disorders in the same
chapter. Clinicians are encouraged to screen for these conditions in
individuals who present with one of them and be aware of overlaps
between these conditions. At the same time, there are important
differences in diagnostic validators and treatment approaches across
these disorders. Moreover, there are close relationships between the
anxiety disorders and some of the obsessive-compulsive and related
disorders (e.g., OCD), which is reflected in the sequence of DSM-5
chapters, with obsessive-compulsive and related disorders following
anxiety disorders.

The obsessive-compulsive and related disorders differ from
developmentally normative preoccupations and rituals by being excessive
or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods. The
distinction between the presence of subclinical symptoms and a clinical
disorder requires assessment of a number of factors, including the
individual's level of distress and impairment in functioning.

The chapter begins with OCD. It then covers body dysmorphic disorder and
hoarding disorder, which are characterized by cognitive symptoms such as
perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance or the perceived need
to save possessions, respectively. The chapter then covers
trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking)
disorder, which are characterized by recurrent body-focused repetitive
behaviors. Finally, it covers substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder due to another medical condition, and other specified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder and unspecified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.

While the specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies among
individuals, certain symptom dimensions are common in OCD, including
those of cleaning (contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions);
symmetry (symmetry obsessions and repeat-235

[]{#index_split_027.html#p281}**236**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

ing, ordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts
(e.g., aggressive, sexual, and religious obsessions and related
compulsions); and harm (e.g., fears of harm to oneself or others and
related checking compulsions). The tic-related specifier of OCD is used
when an individual has a current or past history of a tic disorder.

Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by preoccupation with one or
more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not
observable or appear only slight to others, and by repetitive behaviors
(e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, or reassurance
seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing one's appearance with that of
other people) in response to the appearance concerns. The appearance
preoccupations are not better explained by concerns with body fat or
weight in an individual with an eating disorder. Muscle dysmorphia is a
form of body dysmorphic disorder that is characterized by the belief
that one's body build is too small or is insufficiently muscular.

Hoarding disorder is characterized by persistent difficulty discarding
or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value, as a
result of a strong perceived need to save the items and to distress
associated with discarding them. Hoarding disorder differs from normal
collecting. For example, symptoms of hoarding disorder result in the
accumulation of a large number of possessions that congest and clutter
active living areas to the extent that their intended use is
substantially compromised. The excessive acquisition form of hoarding
disorder, which characterizes most but not all individuals with hoarding
disorder, consists of excessive collecting, buying, or stealing of items
that are not needed or for which there is no available space.

Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) is characterized by recurrent
pulling out of one\'s hair resulting in hair loss, and repeated attempts
to decrease or stop hair pulling.

Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder is characterized by recurrent
picking of one's skin resulting in skin lesions and repeated attempts to
decrease or stop skin picking. The body-focused repetitive behaviors
that characterize these two disorders are not triggered by obsessions or
preoccupations; however, they may be preceded or accompanied by various
emotional states, such as feelings of anxiety or boredom. They may also
be preceded by an increasing sense of tension or may lead to
gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the hair is pulled
out or the skin is picked. Individuals with these disorders may have
varying degrees of conscious awareness of the behavior while engaging in
it, with some individuals displaying more focused attention on the
behavior (with preceding tension and subsequent relief) and other
individuals displaying more automatic behavior (with the behaviors
seeming to occur without full awareness).

Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
consists of symptoms that are due to substance intoxication or
withdrawal or to a medication. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
due to another medical condition involves symptoms characteristic of
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders that are the direct
pathophysiological consequence of a medical disorder. Other specified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder and unspecified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder consist of symptoms that do
not meet criteria for a specific obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder because of atypical presentation or uncertain etiology; these
categories are also used for other specific syndromes that are not
listed in Section II and when insufficient information is available to
diagnose the presentation as another obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder. Examples of specific syndromes not listed in Section II, and
therefore diagnosed as other specified obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder or as unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
include body-focused repetitive behavior disorder and obsessional
jealousy.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders that have a cognitive
component have insight as the basis for specifiers; in each of these
disorders, insight ranges from "good or fair insight" to "poor insight"
to "absent insight/delusional beliefs" with respect to disorder-related
beliefs. For individuals whose obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
symptoms warrant the "with absent insight/delusional beliefs" specifier,
these symptoms should not be diagnosed as a psychotic disorder.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p282}Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

**237**

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.3 (F42)**

A. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both:

Obsessions are defined by (1) and (2):

1\. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are
experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and
unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress.

2\. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges,
or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action
(i.e., by performing a compulsion).

Compulsions are defined by (1) and (2):

1\. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or
mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the
individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or
according to rules that must be applied rigidly.

2\. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing
anxiety or distress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation;
however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected in a realistic
way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly
excessive.

**Note:** Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these
behaviors or mental acts.

B. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more
than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

C. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication) or another medical condition.

D. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another
mental disorder (e.g., excessive worries, as in generalized anxiety
disorder; preoccupation with appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder;
difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, as in hoarding
disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania \[hair-pulling
disorder\]; skin picking, as in excoriation \[skin-picking\] disorder;
stereotypies, as in stereotypic movement disorder; ritualized eating
behavior, as in eating disorders; preoccupation with substances or
gambling, as in substance-related and addictive disorders; preoccupation
with having an illness, as in illness anxiety disorder; sexual urges or
fantasies, as in paraphilic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders; guilty ruminations, as in major
depressive disorder; thought insertion or delusional preoccupations, as
in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; or repetitive
patterns of behavior, as in autism spectrum disorder).

*Specify* if:

**With good or fair insight:** The individual recognizes that
obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not
true or that they may or may not be true.

**With poor insight:** The individual thinks obsessive-compulsive
disorder beliefs are probably true.

**With absent insight/delusional beliefs:** The individual is completely

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

Specifiers

Many individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have
dysfunctional beliefs.

These beliefs can include an inflated sense of responsibility and the
tendency to overestimate threat; perfectionism and intolerance of
uncertainty; and over-importance of thoughts (e.g., believing that
having a forbidden thought is as bad as acting on it) and the need to
control thoughts.

Individuals with OCD vary in the degree of insight they have about the
accuracy of the beliefs that underlie their obsessive-compulsive
symptoms. Many individuals have *good or* *fair insight* (e.g., the
individual believes that the house definitely will not, probably will
not, or may or may not burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times).
Some have *poor insight* (e.g., the individual believes that the house
will probably burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times), and a few
(4% or less) have *absent insight/delusional beliefs* (e.g., the
individual is convinced that the house will burn down if the stove is
not checked 30 times).

Insight can vary within an individual over the course of the illness.
Poorer insight has been linked to worse long-term outcome.

Up to 30% of individuals with OCD have a lifetime tic disorder. This is
most common in males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals
tend to differ from those without a history of tic disorders in the
themes of their OCD symptoms, comorbidity, course, and pattern of
familial transmission.

Diagnostic Features

The characteristic symptoms of OCD are the presence of obsessions and
compulsions (Criterion A). *Obsessions* are repetitive and persistent
thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images (e.g., of violent or horrific
scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone). Importantly, obsessions are
not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary: they are intrusive and
unwanted and cause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. The
individual attempts to ignore or suppress these obsessions (e.g.,
avoiding triggers or using thought suppression) or to neutralize them
with another thought or action (e.g., performing a compulsion).
*Compulsions* (or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing,
checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting, repeating words silently) that
the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or
according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Most individuals with
OCD

have both obsessions and compulsions. Compulsions are typically
performed in response to an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contamination
leading to washing rituals or that something is incorrect leading to
repeating rituals until it feels "just right"). The aim is to reduce the
distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (e.g.,
becoming ill). However, these compulsions either are not connected in a
realistic way to the feared event (e.g., arranging items symmetrically
to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive (e.g.,
showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure,
although some individuals experience relief from anxiety or distress.

Criterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be
time-consuming (e.g., more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically
significant distress or impairment to warrant a diagnosis of OCD. This
criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional
intrusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that are common in the
general population (e.g., double-checking that a door is locked). The
frequency and severity of obsessions and compulsions vary across
individuals with OCD (e.g., some have mild to moderate symptoms,
spending 1--3 hours per day obsessing or doing compulsions, whereas
others have nearly constant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can
be incapacitating).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies between
individuals. However, certain themes, or dimensions, are common,
including those of cleaning (contamination obsessions and cleaning
compulsions); symmetry (symmetry obsessions and repeating,

[]{#index_split_027.html#p284}Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

**239**

ordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g.,
aggressive, sexual, or religious obsessions and related compulsions);
and harm (e.g., fears of harm to oneself or others and checking
compulsions). Some individuals also have difficulties discarding and
accumulate (hoard) objects as a consequence of typical obsessions and
compulsions, such as fears of harming others. These themes occur across
different cultures, are relatively consistent over time in adults with
the disorder, and may be associated with different neural substrates.
Importantly, individuals often have symptoms in more than one dimension.

Individuals with OCD experience a range of affective responses when
confronted with situations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For
example, many individuals experience marked anxiety that can include
recurrent panic attacks. Others report strong feelings of disgust. While
performing compulsions, some individuals report a distressing sense of
"incompleteness" or uneasiness until things look, feel, or sound "just
right."

It is common for individuals with the disorder to avoid people, places,
and things that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example,
individuals with contamination concerns might avoid public situations
(e.g., restaurants, public restrooms) to reduce exposure to feared
contaminants; individuals with intrusive thoughts about causing harm
might avoid social interactions.

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalence of OCD in the United States is 1.2%, with a
similar prevalence internationally (1.1%--1.8%). Females are affected at
a slightly higher rate than males in adulthood, although males are more
commonly affected in childhood.

Development and Course

In the United States, the mean age at onset of OCD is 19.5 years, and
25% of cases start by age 14 years. Onset after age 35 years is unusual
but does occur. Males have an earlier age at onset than females: nearly
25% of males have onset before age 10 years. The onset of symptoms is
typically gradual; however, acute onset has also been reported.

If OCD is untreated, the course is usually chronic, often with waxing
and waning symptoms. Some individuals have an episodic course, and a
minority have a deteriorating course. Without treatment, remission rates
in adults are low (e.g., 20% for those reevaluated 40 years later).
Onset in childhood or adolescence can lead to a lifetime of OCD.
However, 40% of individuals with onset of OCD in childhood or
adolescence may experience remission by early adulthood. The course of
OCD is often complicated by the co-occurrence of other disorders (see
section "Comorbidity" for this disorder).

Compulsions are more easily diagnosed in children than obsessions are
because compulsions are observable. However, most children have both
obsessions and compulsions (as do most adults). The pattern of symptoms
in adults can be stable over time, but it is more variable in children.
Some differences in the content of obsessions and compulsions have been
reported when children and adolescent samples have been compared with
adult samples. These differences likely reflect content appropriate to
different developmental stages (e.g., higher rates of sexual and
religious obsessions in adolescents than in children; higher rates of
harm obsessions \[e.g., fears of catastrophic events, such as death or
illness to self or loved ones\] in children and adolescents than in
adults).

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Greater internalizing symptoms, higher negative emotionality, and
behavioral inhibition in childhood are possible temperamental risk
factors.

Environmental.

Physical and sexual abuse in childhood and other stressful or traumatic
events have been associated with an increased risk for developing OCD.
Some children

[]{#index_split_027.html#p285}**240**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

may develop the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which has
been associated with different environmental factors, including various
infectious agents and a post-infectious autoimmune syndrome.

Genetic and physiological.

The rate of OCD among first-degree relatives of adults with OCD is
approximately two times that among first-degree relatives of those
without the disorder; however, among first-degree relatives of
individuals with onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence, the rate is
increased 10-fold. Familial transmission is due in part to genetic
factors (e.g., a concordance rate of 0.57 for monozygotic vs. 0.22 for
dizygotic twins).

Dysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and
striatum have been most strongly implicated.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

OCD occurs across the world. There is substantial similarity across
cultures in the gender distribution, age at onset, and comorbidity of
OCD. Moreover, around the globe, there is a similar symptom structure
involving cleaning, symmetry, hoarding, taboo thoughts, or fear of harm.
However, regional variation in symptom expression exists, and cultural
factors may shape the content of obsessions and compulsions.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Males have an earlier age at onset of OCD than females and are more
likely to have comorbid tic disorders. Gender differences in the pattern
of symptom dimensions have been reported, with, for example, females
more likely to have symptoms in the cleaning dimension and males more
likely to have symptoms in the forbidden thoughts and symmetry
dimensions. Onset or exacerbation of OCD, as well as symptoms that can
interfere with the mother-infant relationship (e.g., aggressive
obsessions leading to avoidance of the infant), have been reported in
the peripartum period.

Suicide Risk

Suicidal thoughts occur at some point in as many as about half of
individuals with OCD.

Suicide attempts are also reported in up to one-quarter of individuals
with OCD; the presence of comorbid major depressive disorder increases
the risk.

Functional Consequences of

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

OCD is associated with reduced quality of life as well as high levels of
social and occupational impairment. Impairment occurs across many
different domains of life and is associated with symptom severity.
Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and doing
compulsions. Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions or
compulsions can also severely restrict functioning. In addition,
specific symptoms can create specific obstacles. For example, obsessions
about harm can make relationships with family and friends feel
hazardous; the result can be avoidance of these relationships.
Obsessions about symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or
work projects because the project never feels "just right," potentially
resulting in school failure or job loss. Health consequences can also
occur. For example, individuals with contamination concerns may avoid
doctors' offices and hospitals (e.g., because of fears of exposure to
germs) or develop dermatological problems (e.g., skin lesions due to
excessive washing). Sometimes the symptoms of the disorder interfere
with its own treatment (e.g., when medications are considered
contaminated). When the disorder starts in childhood or adolescence,
individuals may experience developmental difficulties. For example,
adolescents may avoid socializ-ing with peers; young adults may struggle
when they leave home to live independently.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p286}Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

**241**

The result can be few significant relationships outside the family and a
lack of autonomy and financial independence from their family of origin.
In addition, some individuals with OCD try to impose rules and
prohibitions on family members because of their disorder (e.g., no one
in the family can have visitors to the house for fear of contamination),
and this can lead to family dysfunction.

Differential Diagnosis

Anxiety disorders.

Recurrent thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and repetitive requests for
reassurance can also occur in anxiety disorders. However, the recurrent
thoughts that are present in generalized anxiety disorder (i.e.,
worries) are usually about real-life concerns, whereas the obsessions of
OCD usually do not involve real-life concerns and can include content
that is odd, irrational, or of a seemingly magical nature; moreover,
compulsions are often present and usually linked to the obsessions. Like
individuals with OCD, individuals with specific phobia can have a fear
reaction to specific objects or situations; however, in specific phobia
the feared object is usually much more circumscribed, and rituals are
not present. In social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the feared
objects or situations are limited to social interactions, and avoidance
or reassurance seeking is focused on reducing this social fear.

Major depressive disorder.

OCD can be distinguished from the rumination of major depressive
disorder, in which thoughts are usually mood-congruent and not
necessarily experienced as intrusive or distressing; moreover,
ruminations are not linked to compulsions, as is typical in OCD.

Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

In body dysmorphic disorder, the

obsessions and compulsions are limited to concerns about physical
appearance; and in trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), the
compulsive behavior is limited to hair pulling in the absence of
obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms focus exclusively on the
persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, marked
distress associated with discarding items, and excessive accumulation of
objects. However, if an individual has obsessions that are typical of
OCD (e.g., concerns about incompleteness or harm), and these obsessions
lead to compulsive hoarding behaviors (e.g., acquiring all objects in a
set to attain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspapers
because they may contain information that could prevent harm), a
diagnosis of OCD should be given instead.

Eating disorders.

OCD can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that in OCD the
obsessions and compulsions are not limited to concerns about weight and
food.

Tics (in tic disorder) and stereotyped movements.

A *tic* is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,

nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g., eye blinking, throat
clearing). A *stereotyped movement* is a repetitive, seemingly driven,
nonfunctional motor behavior (e.g., head banging, body rocking,
self-biting). Tics and stereotyped movements are typically less complex
than compulsions and are not aimed at neutralizing obsessions. However,
distinguishing between complex tics and compulsions can be difficult.
Whereas compulsions are usually preceded by obsessions, tics are often
preceded by premonitory sensory urges. Some individuals have symptoms of
both OCD and a tic disorder, in which case both diagnoses may be
warranted.

Psychotic disorders.

Some individuals with OCD have poor insight or even delusional OCD
beliefs. However, they have obsessions and compulsions (distinguishing
their condition from delusional disorder) and do not have other features
of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (e.g., hallucinations or
formal thought disorder).

Other compulsive-like behaviors.

Certain behaviors are sometimes described as "compulsive," including
sexual behavior (in the case of paraphilias), gambling (i.e., gambling

[]{#index_split_027.html#p287}**242**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

disorder), and substance use (e.g., alcohol use disorder). However,
these behaviors differ from the compulsions of OCD in that the person
usually derives pleasure from the activity and may wish to resist it
only because of its deleterious consequences.

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.

Although obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and OCD have similar
names, the clinical manifestations of these disorders are quite
different. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not
characterized by intrusive thoughts, images, or urges or by repetitive
behaviors that are performed in response to these intrusions; instead,
it involves an enduring and pervasive maladaptive pattern of excessive
perfectionism and rigid control. If an individual manifests symptoms of
both OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, both diagnoses
can be given.

Comorbidity

Individuals with OCD often have other psychopathology. Many adults with
the disorder have a lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (76%;
e.g., panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety
disorder, specific phobia) or a depressive or bipolar disorder (63% for
any depressive or bipolar disorder, with the most common being major
depressive disorder \[41%\]). Onset of OCD is usually later than for
most comorbid anxiety disorders (with the exception of separation
anxiety disorder) and PTSD but often precedes that of depressive
disorders. Comorbid obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is also
common in individuals with OCD (e.g., ranging from 23% to 32%).

Up to 30% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder. A
comorbid tic disorder is most common in males with onset of OCD in
childhood. These individuals tend to differ from those without a history
of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD

symptoms, comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission. A
triad of OCD, tic disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
can also be seen in children.

Disorders that occur more frequently in individuals with OCD than in
those without the disorder include several obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania
(hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder.
Finally, an association between OCD and some disorders characterized by
impulsivity, such as oppositional defiant disorder, has been reported.

OCD is also much more common in individuals with certain other disorders
than would be expected based on its prevalence in the general
population; when one of those other disorders is diagnosed, the
individual should be assessed for OCD as well. For example, in
individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the
prevalence of OCD is approximately 12%. Rates of OCD are also elevated
in bipolar disorder; eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and
bulimia nervosa; and Tourette's disorder.

Body Dysmorphic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.7 (F45.22)**

A. Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical
appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others.

B. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has
performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive
grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g.,
comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to the
appearance concerns.

C. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

D. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with
body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic
criteria for an eating disorder.

**243**

*Specify* if:

**With muscle dysmorphia:** The individual is preoccupied with the idea
that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This
specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other body
areas, which is often the case.

*Specify* if:

Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs
(e.g., "I look ugly" or

"I look deformed").

**With good or fair insight:** The individual recognizes that the body
dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that
they may or may not be true.

**With poor insight:** The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic
disorder beliefs are probably true.

**With absent insight/delusional beliefs:** The individual is completely
convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true.

Diagnostic Features

Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (formerly known as
*dysmorphophobia*) are preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or
flaws in their physical appearance, which they believe look ugly,
unattractive, abnormal, or deformed (Criterion A). The perceived flaws
are not observable or appear only slight to other individuals. Concerns
range from looking "unattractive" or "not right" to looking "hideous" or
"like a monster." Preoccupations can focus on one or many body areas,
most commonly the skin (e.g., perceived acne, scars, lines, wrinkles,
paleness), hair (e.g., "thinning" hair or "excessive" body or facial
hair), or nose (e.g., size or shape). However, any body area can be the
focus of concern (e.g., eyes, teeth, weight, stomach, breasts, legs,
face size or shape, lips, chin, eyebrows, genitals). Some individuals
are concerned about perceived asymmetry of body areas. The
preoccupations are intrusive, unwanted, time-consuming (occurring, on
average, 3--8

hours per day), and usually difficult to resist or control.

Excessive repetitive behaviors or mental acts (e.g., comparing) are
performed in response to the preoccupation (Criterion B). The individual
feels driven to perform these behaviors, which are not pleasurable and
may increase anxiety and dysphoria. They are typically time-consuming
and difficult to resist or control. Common behaviors are comparing one's
appearance with that of other individuals; repeatedly checking perceived
defects in mirrors or other reflecting surfaces or examining them
directly; excessively grooming (e.g., combing, styling, shaving,
plucking, or pulling hair); camouflaging (e.g., repeatedly applying
makeup or covering disliked areas with such things as a hat, clothing,
makeup, or hair); seeking reassurance about how the perceived flaws
look; touching disliked areas to check them; excessively exercising or
weight lifting; and seeking cosmetic procedures. Some individuals
excessively tan (e.g., to darken "pale" skin or diminish perceived
acne), repeatedly change their clothes (e.g., to camouflage perceived
defects), or compulsively shop (e.g., for beauty products). Compulsive
skin picking intended to improve perceived skin defects is common and
can cause skin damage, infections, or ruptured blood vessels. The
preoccupation must cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
(Criterion C); usually both are present. Body dysmorphic disorder must
be differentiated from an eating disorder.

*Muscle dysmorphia,* a form of body dysmorphic disorder occurring almost
exclusively in males, consists of preoccupation with the idea that one's
body is too small or insufficiently lean or muscular. Individuals with
this form of the disorder actually have a normal-looking body or are
even very muscular. They may also be preoccupied with other body areas,
such as skin or hair. A majority (but not all) diet, exercise, and/or
lift weights excessively, sometimes causing bodily damage. Some use
potentially dangerous anabolic-

[]{#index_split_027.html#p289}**244**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

androgenic steroids and other substances to try to make their body
bigger and more muscular. Body dysmorphic disorder by proxy is a form of
body dysmorphic disorder in which individuals are preoccupied with
defects they perceive in another person's appearance.

Insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs can range from good
to absent/

delusional (i.e., delusional beliefs consisting of complete conviction
that the individual's view of their appearance is accurate and
undistorted). On average, insight is poor; one-third or more of
individuals currently have delusional body dysmorphic disorder beliefs.

Individuals with delusional body dysmorphic disorder tend to have
greater morbidity in some areas (e.g., suicidality), but this appears
accounted for by their tendency to have more severe body dysmorphic
disorder symptoms.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Many individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have ideas or delusions
of reference, believing that other people take special notice of them or
mock them because of how they look. Body dysmorphic disorder is
associated with high levels of anxiety, social anxiety, social
avoidance, depressed mood, neuroticism, and perfectionism as well as low
extroversion and low self-esteem. Many individuals are ashamed of their
appearance and their excessive focus on how they look, and are reluctant
to reveal their concerns to others. A majority of individuals receive
cosmetic treatment to try to improve their perceived defects.
Dermatological treatment and surgery are most common, but any type
(e.g., dental, electrolysis) may be received. Occasionally, individuals
may perform surgery on themselves. Body dysmorphic disorder appears to
respond poorly to such treatments and sometimes becomes worse. Some
individuals take legal action or are violent toward the clinician
because they are dissatisfied with the cosmetic outcome.

Body dysmorphic disorder has been associated with executive dysfunction
and visual processing abnormalities, with a bias for analyzing and
encoding details rather than holistic or configural aspects of visual
stimuli. Individuals with this disorder tend to have a bias for negative
and threatening interpretations of facial expressions and ambiguous
sce-narios.

Prevalence

The point prevalence among U.S. adults is 2.4% (2.5% in females and 2.2%
in males). Outside the United States (i.e., Germany), current prevalence
is approximately 1.7%--1.8%, with a gender distribution similar to that
in the United States. The current prevalence is 9%--15% among
dermatology patients, 7%--8% among U.S. cosmetic surgery patients, 3%--

16% among international cosmetic surgery patients (most studies), 8%
among adult orth-odontia patients, and 10% among patients presenting for
oral or maxillofacial surgery.

Development and Course

The mean age at disorder onset is 16--17 years, the median age at onset
is 15 years, and the most common age at onset is 12--13 years.
Two-thirds of individuals have disorder onset before age 18. Subclinical
body dysmorphic disorder symptoms begin, on average, at age 12 or 13
years. Subclinical concerns usually evolve gradually to the full
disorder, although some individuals experience abrupt onset of body
dysmorphic disorder. The disorder appears to usually be chronic,
although improvement is likely when evidence-based treatment is
received. The disorder's clinical features appear largely similar in
children/

adolescents and adults. Body dysmorphic disorder occurs in the elderly,
but little is known about the disorder in this age group. Individuals
with disorder onset before age 18 years are more likely to attempt
suicide, have more comorbidity, and have gradual (rather than acute)
disorder onset than those with adult-onset body dysmorphic disorder.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p290}Body Dysmorphic Disorder

**245**

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Body dysmorphic disorder has been associated with high rates of
childhood neglect and abuse.

Genetic and physiological.

The prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder is elevated in first-degree
relatives of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Body dysmorphic disorder has been reported internationally. It appears
that the disorder may have more similarities than differences across
races and cultures but that cultural values and preferences may
influence symptom content to some degree. *Taijin kyofusho,* included in
the traditional Japanese diagnostic system, has a subtype similar to
body dysmorphic disorder: *shubo-kyofu* ("the phobia of a deformed
body").

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Females and males appear to have more similarities than differences in
terms of most clinical features--- for example, disliked body areas,
types of repetitive behaviors, symptom severity, suicidality,
comorbidity, illness course, and receipt of cosmetic procedures for body
dysmorphic disorder. However, males are more likely to have genital
preoccupations, and females are more likely to have a comorbid eating
disorder. Muscle dysmorphia occurs almost exclusively in males.

Suicide Risk

Rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are high in both adults
and children/adolescents with body dysmorphic disorder. Furthermore,
risk for suicide appears high in adolescents. A substantial proportion
of individuals attribute suicidal ideation or suicide attempts primarily
to their appearance concerns. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder
have many risk factors for completed suicide, such as high rates of
suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, demographic characteristics
associated with suicide, and high rates of comorbid major depressive
disorder.

Functional Consequences of

Body Dysmorphic Disorder

Nearly all individuals with body dysmorphic disorder experience impaired
psychosocial functioning because of their appearance concerns.
Impairment can range from moderate (e.g., avoidance of some social
situations) to extreme and incapacitating (e.g., being completely
housebound). On average, psychosocial functioning and quality of life
are markedly poor. More severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms are
associated with poorer functioning and quality of life. Most individuals
experience impairment in their job, academic, or role functioning (e.g.,
as a parent or caregiver), which is often severe (e.g., performing
poorly, missing school or work, not working). About 20% of youths with
body dysmorphic disorder report dropping out of school primarily because
of their body dysmorphic disorder symptoms. Impairment in social
functioning (e.g., social activities, relationships, intimacy),
including avoidance, is common. Individuals may be housebound because of
their body dysmorphic disorder symptoms, sometimes for years. A high
proportion of adults and adolescents have been psychiatrically
hospitalized.

Differential Diagnosis

Normal appearance concerns and clearly noticeable physical defects.

Body dysmorphic disorder differs from normal appearance concerns in
being characterized by exces-

[]{#index_split_027.html#p291}**246**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

sive appearance-related preoccupations and repetitive behaviors that are
time-consuming, are usually difficult to resist or control, and cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Physical
defects that are clearly noticeable (i.e., not slight) are not diagnosed
as body dysmorphic disorder. However, skin picking as a symptom of body
dysmorphic disorder can cause noticeable skin lesions and scarring; in
such cases, body dysmorphic disorder should be diagnosed.

Eating disorders.

In an individual with an eating disorder, concerns about being fat are
considered a symptom of the eating disorder rather than body dysmorphic
disorder.

However, weight concerns may occur in body dysmorphic disorder. Eating
disorders and body dysmorphic disorder can be comorbid, in which case
both should be diagnosed.

Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

The preoccupations and repetitive

behaviors of body dysmorphic disorder differ from obsessions and
compulsions in OCD

in that the former focus only on appearance. These disorders have other
differences, such as poorer insight in body dysmorphic disorder. When
skin picking is intended to improve the appearance of perceived skin
defects, body dysmorphic disorder, rather than excoriation
(skin-picking) disorder, is diagnosed. When hair removal (plucking,
pulling, or other types of removal) is intended to improve perceived
defects in the appearance of facial or body hair, body dysmorphic
disorder is diagnosed rather than trichotillomania (hair-pulling
disorder).

Illness anxiety disorder.

Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are not preoccupied with
having or acquiring a serious illness and do not have particularly
elevated levels of somatization.

Major depressive disorder.

The prominent preoccupation with appearance and excessive repetitive
behaviors in body dysmorphic disorder differentiate it from major
depressive disorder. However, major depressive disorder and depressive
symptoms are common in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder, often
appearing to be secondary to the distress and impairment that body
dysmorphic disorder causes. Body dysmorphic disorder should be diagnosed
in depressed individuals if diagnostic criteria for body dysmorphic
disorder are met.

Anxiety disorders.

Social anxiety and avoidance are common in body dysmorphic disorder.
However, unlike social anxiety disorder (social phobia), agoraphobia,
and avoidant personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder includes
prominent appearance-related preoccupation, which may be delusional, and
repetitive behaviors, and the social anxiety and avoidance are due to
concerns about perceived appearance defects and the belief or fear that
other people will consider these individuals ugly, ridicule them, or
reject them because of their physical features. Unlike generalized
anxiety disorder, anxiety and worry in body dysmorphic disorder focus on
perceived appearance flaws.

Psychotic disorders.

Many individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have delusional
appearance beliefs (i.e., complete conviction that their view of their
perceived defects is accurate), which is diagnosed as body dysmorphic
disorder, with absent insight/

delusional beliefs, not as delusional disorder. Appearance-related ideas
or delusions of reference are common in body dysmorphic disorder;
however, unlike schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, body
dysmorphic disorder involves prominent appearance preoccupations and
related repetitive behaviors, and disorganized behavior and other
psychotic symptoms are absent (except for appearance beliefs, which may
be delusional).

Other disorders and symptoms.

Body dysmorphic disorder should not be diagnosed if

the preoccupation is limited to discomfort with or a desire to be rid of
one's primary and/

or secondary sex characteristics in an individual with gender dysphoria
or if the preoccupation focuses on the belief that one emits a foul or
offensive body odor as in olfactory reference syndrome (which is not a
DSM-5 disorder). Body identity integrity disorder

[]{#index_split_027.html#p292}Hoarding Disorder

**247**

(apotemnophilia) (which is not a DSM-5 disorder) involves a desire to
have a limb amputated to correct an experience of mismatch between a
person's sense of body identity and his or her actual anatomy. However,
the concern does not focus on the limb's appearance, as it would in body
dysmorphic disorder. *Koro,* a culturally related disorder that usually
occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, consists of a fear that the
penis (labia, nipples, or breasts in females) is shrinking or retracting
and will disappear into the abdomen, often accompanied by a belief that
death will result. Koro differs from body dysmorphic disorder in several
ways, including a focus on death rather than preoccupation with
perceived ugliness. *Dysmorphic concern* (which is not a DSM-5 disorder)
is a much broader construct than, and is not equivalent to, body
dysmorphic disorder. It involves symptoms reflecting an overconcern with
slight or imagined flaws in appearance.

Comorbidity

Major depressive disorder is the most common comorbid disorder, with
onset usually after that of body dysmorphic disorder. Comorbid social
anxiety disorder (social phobia), OCD, and substance-related disorders
are also common.

Hoarding Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.3 (F42)**

A. Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions,
regardless of their actual value.

B. This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to
distress associated with discarding them.

C. The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of
possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and
substantially compromises their intended use. If living areas are
uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of third parties
(e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities).

D. The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (including
maintaining a safe environment for self and others).

E. The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g.,
brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, Prader-Willi syndrome).

F. The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another
mental disorder (e.g., obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder,
decreased energy in major depressive disorder, delusions in
schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, cognitive deficits in major
neurocognitive disorder, restricted interests in autism spectrum
disorder).

*Specify* if:

**With excessive acquisition:** If difficulty discarding possessions is
accompanied by excessive acquisition of items that are not needed or for
which there is no available space.

*Specify* if:

**With good or fair insight:** The individual recognizes that
hoarding-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty
discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are problematic.

**With poor insight**: The individual is mostly convinced that
hoarding-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty
discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are not problematic
despite evidence to the contrary.

**With absent insight/delusional beliefs:** The individual is completely
convinced that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to
difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are not
problematic despite evidence to the contrary.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p293}**248**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

Specifiers

With excessive acquisition.

Approximately 80%--90% of individuals with hoarding

disorder display excessive acquisition. The most frequent form of
acquisition is excessive buying, followed by acquisition of free items
(e.g., leaflets, items discarded by others).

Stealing is less common. Some individuals may deny excessive acquisition
when first assessed, yet it may appear later during the course of
treatment. Individuals with hoarding disorder typically experience
distress if they are unable to or are prevented from acquiring items.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of hoarding disorder is persistent difficulties
discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value
(Criterion A). The term *persistent* indicates a long-standing
difficulty rather than more transient life circumstances that may lead
to excessive clutter, such as inheriting property. The difficulty in
discarding possessions noted in Criterion A refers to any form of
discarding, including throwing away, selling, giving away, or recycling.
The main reasons given for these difficulties are the perceived utility
or aesthetic value of the items or strong sentimental attachment to the
possessions.

Some individuals feel responsible for the fate of their possessions and
often go to great lengths to avoid being wasteful. Fears of losing
important information are also common.

The most commonly saved items are newspapers, magazines, old clothing,
bags, books, mail, and paperwork, but virtually any item can be saved.
The nature of items is not limited to possessions that most other people
would define as useless or of limited value.

Many individuals collect and save large numbers of valuable things as
well, which are often found in piles mixed with other less valuable
items.

Individuals with hoarding disorder purposefully save possessions and
experience distress when facing the prospect of discarding them
(Criterion B). This criterion emphasizes that the saving of possessions
is intentional, which discriminates hoarding disorder from other forms
of psychopathology that are characterized by the passive accumulation of
items or the absence of distress when possessions are removed.

Individuals accumulate large numbers of items that fill up and clutter
active living areas to the extent that their intended use is no longer
possible (Criterion C). For example, the individual may not be able to
cook in the kitchen, sleep in his or her bed, or sit in a chair. If the
space can be used, it is only with great difficulty. *Clutter* is
defined as a large group of usually unrelated or marginally related
objects piled together in a disorganized fashion in spaces designed for
other purposes (e.g., tabletops, floor, hallway). Criterion C

emphasizes the "active" living areas of the home, rather than more
peripheral areas, such as garages, attics, or basements, that are
sometimes cluttered in homes of individuals without hoarding disorder.
However, individuals with hoarding disorder often have possessions that
spill beyond the active living areas and can occupy and impair the use
of other spaces, such as vehicles, yards, the workplace, and friends'
and relatives' houses. In some cases, living areas may be uncluttered
because of the intervention of third parties (e.g., family members,
cleaners, local authorities). Individuals who have been forced to clear
their homes still have a symptom picture that meets criteria for
hoarding disorder because the lack of clutter is due to a third-party
intervention. Hoarding disorder contrasts with normative collecting
behavior, which is organized and systematic, even if in some cases the
actual amount of possessions may be similar to the amount accumulated by
an individual with hoarding disorder. Normative collecting does not
produce the clutter, distress, or impairment typical of hoarding
disorder.

Symptoms (i.e., difficulties discarding and/or clutter) must cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning, including maintaining a safe
environment for self and others (Criterion D). In some cases,

[]{#index_split_027.html#p294}Hoarding Disorder

**249**

particularly when there is poor insight, the individual may not report
distress, and the impairment may be apparent only to those around the
individual. However, any attempts to discard or clear the possessions by
third parties result in high levels of distress.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Other common features of hoarding disorder include indecisiveness,
perfectionism, avoidance, procrastination, difficulty planning and
organizing tasks, and distractibility.

Some individuals with hoarding disorder live in unsanitary conditions
that may be a logical consequence of severely cluttered spaces and/or
that are related to planning and organizing difficulties. *Animal
hoarding* can be defined as the accumulation of a large number of
animals and a failure to provide minimal standards of nutrition,
sanitation, and veterinary care and to act on the deteriorating
condition of the animals (including disease, starvation, or death) and
the environment (e.g., severe overcrowding, extremely unsanitary
conditions). Animal hoarding may be a special manifestation of hoarding
disorder. Most individuals who hoard animals also hoard inanimate
objects. The most prominent differences between animal and object
hoarding are the extent of unsanitary conditions and the poorer insight
in animal hoarding.

Prevalence

Nationally representative prevalence studies of hoarding disorder are
not available. Community surveys estimate the point prevalence of
clinically significant hoarding in the United States and Europe to be
approximately 2%--6%. Hoarding disorder affects both males and females,
but some epidemiological studies have reported a significantly greater
prevalence among males. This contrasts with clinical samples, which are
predominantly female. Hoarding symptoms appear to be almost three times
more prevalent in older adults (ages 55--94 years) compared with younger
adults (ages 34--44 years).

Development and Course

Hoarding appears to begin early in life and spans well into the late
stages. Hoarding symptoms may first emerge around ages 11--15 years,
start interfering with the individual's everyday functioning by the
mid-20s, and cause clinically significant impairment by the mid-30s.
Participants in clinical research studies are usually in their 50s.
Thus, the severity of hoarding increases with each decade of life. Once
symptoms begin, the course of hoarding is often chronic, with few
individuals reporting a waxing and waning course.

Pathological hoarding in children appears to be easily distinguished
from developmentally adaptive saving and collecting behaviors. Because
children and adolescents typically do not control their living
environment and discarding behaviors, the possible intervention of third
parties (e.g., parents keeping the spaces usable and thus reducing
interference) should be considered when making the diagnosis.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Indecisiveness is a prominent feature of individuals with hoarding
disorder and their first-degree relatives.

Environmental.

Individuals with hoarding disorder often retrospectively report
stressful and traumatic life events preceding the onset of the disorder
or causing an exacerbation.

Genetic and physiological.

Hoarding behavior is familial, with about 50% of individuals who hoard
reporting having a relative who also hoards. Twin studies indicate that
approximately 50% of the variability in hoarding behavior is
attributable to additive genetic factors.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p295}**250**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

While most of the research has been done in Western, industrialized
countries and urban communities, the available data from non-Western and
developing countries suggest that hoarding is a universal phenomenon
with consistent clinical features.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

The key features of hoarding disorder (i.e., difficulties discarding,
excessive amount of clutter) are generally comparable in males and
females, but females tend to display more excessive acquisition,
particularly excessive buying, than do males.

Functional Consequences of Hoarding Disorder

Clutter impairs basic activities, such as moving through the house,
cooking, cleaning, personal hygiene, and even sleeping. Appliances may
be broken, and utilities such as water and electricity may be
disconnected, as access for repair work may be difficult. Quality of
life is often considerably impaired. In severe cases, hoarding can put
individuals at risk for fire, falling (especially elderly individuals),
poor sanitation, and other health risks. Hoarding disorder is associated
with occupational impairment, poor physical health, and high social
service utilization. Family relationships are frequently under great
strain. Conflict with neighbors and local authorities is common, and a
substantial proportion of individuals with severe hoarding disorder have
been involved in legal eviction proceedings, and some have a history of
eviction.

Differential Diagnosis

Other medical conditions.

Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are judged to be a
direct consequence of another medical condition (Criterion E), such as
traumatic brain injury, surgical resection for treatment of a tumor or
seizure control, cerebrovascular disease, infections of the central
nervous system (e.g., herpes simplex encephalitis), or neurogenetic
conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome. Damage to the anterior
ven-tromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices has been particularly
associated with the excessive accumulation of objects. In these
individuals, the hoarding behavior is not present prior to the onset of
the brain damage and appears shortly after the brain damage occurs.

Some of these individuals appear to have little interest in the
accumulated items and are able to discard them easily or do not care if
others discard them, whereas others appear to be very reluctant to
discard anything.

Neurodevelopmental disorders.

Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is
judged to be a direct consequence of a neurodevelopmental disorder, such
as autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder).

Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is
judged to be a direct consequence of delusions or negative symptoms in
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

Major depressive episode.

Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is
judged to be a direct consequence of psychomotor retardation, fatigue,
or loss of energy during a major depressive episode.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms

are judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or
compulsions, such as fears of contamination, harm, or feelings of
incompleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Feelings of
incompleteness (e.g., losing one's identity, or having to document and
preserve all life experiences) are the most frequent OCD symptoms
associated with this form of hoarding. The accumulation of objects can
also be the result of persistently avoid-

[]{#index_split_027.html#p296}Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)
**251**

ing onerous rituals (e.g., not discarding objects in order to avoid
endless washing or checking rituals).

In OCD, the behavior is generally unwanted and highly distressing, and
the individual experiences no pleasure or reward from it. Excessive
acquisition is usually not present; if excessive acquisition is present,
items are acquired because of a specific obsession (e.g., the need to
buy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid
contaminating other people), not because of a genuine desire to possess
the items. Individuals who hoard in the context of OCD are also more
likely to accumulate bizarre items, such as trash, feces, urine, nails,
hair, used diapers, or rotten food. Accumulation of such items is very
unusual in hoarding disorder.

When severe hoarding appears concurrently with other typical symptoms of
OCD but is judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding
disorder and OCD may be diagnosed.

Neurocognitive disorders.

Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is
judged to be a direct consequence of a degenerative disorder, such as
neurocognitive disorder associated with frontotemporal lobar
degeneration or Alzheimer's disease.

Typically, onset of the accumulating behavior is gradual and follows
onset of the neurocognitive disorder. The accumulating behavior may be
accompanied by self-neglect and severe domestic squalor, alongside other
neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibition, gambling,
rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self-injurious behaviors.

Comorbidity

Approximately 75% of individuals with hoarding disorder have a comorbid
mood or anxiety disorder. The most common comorbid conditions are major
depressive disorder (up to 50% of cases), social anxiety disorder
(social phobia), and generalized anxiety disorder.

Approximately 20% of individuals with hoarding disorder also have
symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for OCD. These comorbidities may
often be the main reason for consultation, because individuals are
unlikely to spontaneously report hoarding symptoms, and these symptoms
are often not asked about in routine clinical interviews.

Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)

Diagnostic Criteria

**312.39 (F63.3)**

A. Recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss.

B. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling.

C. The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

D. The hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical
condition (e.g., a dermatological condition).

E. The hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another
mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in
appearance in body dysmorphic disorder).

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) is the
recurrent pulling out of one's own hair (Criterion A). Hair pulling may
occur from any region of the body in which hair grows; the most common
sites are the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelids, while less common sites are
axillary, facial, pubic, and peri-rectal regions. Hair-pulling sites may
vary over time. Hair pulling may occur in brief episodes scattered
throughout the day or during less frequent but more sustained periods
that can continue for hours, and such hair
[]{#index_split_027.html#p297}**252**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

pulling may endure for months or years. Criterion A requires that hair
pulling lead to hair loss, although individuals with this disorder may
pull hair in a widely distributed pattern (i.e., pulling single hairs
from all over a site) such that hair loss may not be clearly visible.

Alternatively, individuals may attempt to conceal or camouflage hair
loss (e.g., by using makeup, scarves, or wigs). Individuals with
trichotillomania have made repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair
pulling (Criterion B). Criterion C indicates that hair pulling causes
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning. The term *distress* includes
negative affects that may be experienced by individuals with hair
pulling, such as feeling a loss of control, embarrassment, and shame.
Significant impairment may occur in several different areas of
functioning (e.g., social, occupational, academic, and leisure), in part
because of avoidance of work, school, or other public situations.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Hair pulling may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals
involving hair. Thus, individuals may search for a particular kind of
hair to pull (e.g., hairs with a specific texture or color), may try to
pull out hair in a specific way (e.g., so that the root comes out
intact), or may visually examine or tactilely or orally manipulate the
hair after it has been pulled (e.g., rolling the hair between the
fingers, pulling the strand between the teeth, biting the hair into
pieces, or swallowing the hair).

Hair pulling may also be preceded or accompanied by various emotional
states; it may be triggered by feelings of anxiety or boredom, may be
preceded by an increasing sense of tension (either immediately before
pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the urge to pull), or
may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the hair
is pulled out. Hair-pulling behavior may involve varying degrees of
conscious awareness, with some individuals displaying more focused
attention on the hair pulling (with preceding tension and subsequent
relief), and other individuals displaying more automatic behavior (in
which the hair pulling seems to occur without full awareness). Many
individuals report a mix of both behavioral styles. Some individuals
experience an "itch-like" or tingling sensation in the scalp that is
alleviated by the act of pulling hair. Pain does not usually accompany
hair pulling.

Patterns of hair loss are highly variable. Areas of complete alopecia,
as well as areas of thinned hair density, are common. When the scalp is
involved, there may be a predilection for pulling out hair in the crown
or parietal regions. There may be a pattern of nearly complete baldness
except for a narrow perimeter around the outer margins of the scalp,
particularly at the nape of the neck ("tonsure trichotillomania").
Eyebrows and eyelashes may be completely absent.

Hair pulling does not usually occur in the presence of other
individuals, except immediate family members. Some individuals have
urges to pull hair from other individuals and may sometimes try to find
opportunities to do so surreptitiously. Some individuals may pull hairs
from pets, dolls, and other fibrous materials (e.g., sweaters or
carpets).

Some individuals may deny their hair pulling to others. The majority of
individuals with trichotillomania also have one or more other
body-focused repetitive behaviors, including skin picking, nail biting,
and lip chewing.

Prevalence

In the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate for
trichotillomania in adults and adolescents is 1%--2%. Females are more
frequently affected than males, at a ratio of approximately 10:1. This
estimate likely reflects the true gender ratio of the condition,
although it may also reflect differential treatment seeking based on
gender or cultural attitudes regarding appearance (e.g., acceptance of
normative hair loss among males).

Among children with trichotillomania, males and females are more equally
represented.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p298}Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)
**253**

Development and Course

Hair pulling may be seen in infants, and this behavior typically
resolves during early development. Onset of hair pulling in
trichotillomania most commonly coincides with, or follows the onset of,
puberty. Sites of hair pulling may vary over time. The usual course of
trichotillomania is chronic, with some waxing and waning if the disorder
is untreated. Symptoms may possibly worsen in females accompanying
hormonal changes (e.g., menstruation, perimeno-pause). For some
individuals, the disorder may come and go for weeks, months, or years at
a time. A minority of individuals remit without subsequent relapse
within a few years of onset.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

There is evidence for a genetic vulnerability to trichotillomania. The
disorder is more common in individuals with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) and their first-degree relatives than in the general
population.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Trichotillomania appears to manifest similarly across cultures, although
there is a paucity of data from non-Western regions.

Diagnostic Markers

Most individuals with trichotillomania admit to hair pulling; thus,
dermatopathological diagnosis is rarely required. Skin biopsy and
dermoscopy (or trichoscopy) of trichotillomania are able to
differentiate the disorder from other causes of alopecia. In
trichotillomania, dermoscopy shows a range of characteristic features,
including decreased hair density, short vellus hair, and broken hairs
with different shaft lengths.

Functional Consequences of

Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)

Trichotillomania is associated with distress as well as with social and
occupational impairment. There may be irreversible damage to hair growth
and hair quality. Infrequent medical consequences of trichotillomania
include digit purpura, musculoskeletal injury (e.g., carpal tunnel
syndrome; back, shoulder and neck pain), blepharitis, and dental damage
(e.g., worn or broken teeth due to hair biting). Swallowing of hair
(trichophagia) may lead to trichobezoars, with subsequent anemia,
abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea and vomiting, bowel obstruction, and
even perforation.

Differential Diagnosis

Normative hair removal/manipulation.

Trichotillomania should not be diagnosed when

hair removal is performed solely for cosmetic reasons (i.e., to improve
one's physical appearance). Many individuals twist and play with their
hair, but this behavior does not usually qualify for a diagnosis of
trichotillomania. Some individuals may bite rather than pull hair;
again, this does not qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania.

Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

Individuals with OCD and symmetry concerns may pull out hairs as part of
their symmetry rituals, and individuals with body dysmorphic disorder
may remove body hair that they perceive as ugly, asymmetrical, or
abnormal; in such cases a diagnosis of trichotillomania is not given.
The description of body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other
specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder excludes individuals
who meet diagnostic criteria for trichotillomania.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p299}**254**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders.

In neurodevelopmental disorders, hair pulling may

meet the definition of stereotypies (e.g., in stereotypic movement
disorder). Tics (in tic disorders) rarely lead to hair pulling.

Psychotic disorder.

Individuals with a psychotic disorder may remove hair in response to a
delusion or hallucination. Trichotillomania is not diagnosed in such
cases.

Another medical condition.

Trichotillomania is not diagnosed if the hair pulling or hair loss is
attributable to another medical condition (e.g., inflammation of the
skin or other dermatological conditions). Other causes of scarring
alopecia (e.g., alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium)
or nonscarring alopecia (e.g., chronic discoid lupus erythematosus,
lichen planopilaris, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia,
pseudopelade, folliculitis decalvans, dissecting folliculitis, acne
keloidalis nuchae) should be considered in individuals with hair loss
who deny hair pulling. Skin biopsy or dermoscopy can be used to
differentiate individuals with trichotillomania from those with
dermatological disorders.

Substance-related disorders.

Hair-pulling symptoms may be exacerbated by certain

substances---for example, stimulants---but it is less likely that
substances are the primary cause of persistent hair pulling.

Comorbidity

Trichotillomania is often accompanied by other mental disorders, most
commonly major depressive disorder and excoriation (skin-picking)
disorder. Repetitive body-focused symptoms other than hair pulling or
skin picking (e.g. nail biting) occur in the majority of individuals
with trichotillomania and may deserve an additional diagnosis of other
specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i.e., body-focused
repetitive behavior disorder).

Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**698.4 (L98.1)**

A. Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions.

B. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking.

C. The skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

D. The skin picking is not attributable to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g.,
scabies).

E. The skin picking is not better explained by symptoms of another
mental disorder (e.g., delusions or tactile hallucinations in a
psychotic disorder, attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in
appearance in body dysmorphic disorder, stereotypies in stereotypic
movement disorder, or intention to harm oneself in nonsuicidal
self-injury).

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of excoriation (skin-picking) disorder is
recurrent picking at one's own skin (Criterion A). The most commonly
picked sites are the face, arms, and hands, but many individuals pick
from multiple body sites. Individuals may pick at healthy skin, at minor
skin irregularities, at lesions such as pimples or calluses, or at scabs
from previous picking. Most individuals pick with their fingernails,
although many use tweezers, pins, or other objects. In addition to skin
picking, there may be skin rubbing, squeezing, lancing, and biting.
Individuals with excoriation disorder often spend significant amounts of
time on their picking behavior, sometimes several hours per day, and
such skin picking may []{#index_split_027.html#p300}Excoriation
(Skin-Picking) Disorder

**255**

endure for months or years. Criterion A requires that skin picking lead
to skin lesions, although individuals with this disorder often attempt
to conceal or camouflage such lesions (e.g., with makeup or clothing).
Individuals with excoriation disorder have made repeated attempts to
decrease or stop skin picking (Criterion B).

Criterion C indicates that skin picking causes clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning. The term *distress* includes negative affects that may
be experienced by individuals with skin picking, such as feeling a loss
of control, embarrassment, and shame. Significant impairment may occur
in several different areas of functioning (e.g., social, occupational,
academic, and leisure), in part because of avoidance of social
situations.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Skin picking may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals
involving skin or scabs.

Thus, individuals may search for a particular kind of scab to pull, and
they may examine, play with, or mouth or swallow the skin after it has
been pulled. Skin picking may also be preceded or accompanied by various
emotional states. Skin picking may be triggered by feelings of anxiety
or boredom, may be preceded by an increasing sense of tension (either
immediately before picking the skin or when attempting to resist the
urge to pick), and may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of
relief when the skin or scab has been picked. Some individuals report
picking in response to a minor skin irregularity or to relieve an
uncomfortable bodily sensation. Pain is not routinely reported to
accompany skin picking. Some individuals engage in skin picking that is
more focused (i.e., with preceding tension and subsequent relief),
whereas others engage in more automatic picking (i.e., when skin picking
occurs without preceding tension and without full awareness), and many
have a mix of both behavioral styles. Skin picking does not usually
occur in the presence of other individuals, except immediate family
members. Some individuals report picking the skin of others.

Prevalence

In the general population, the lifetime prevalence for excoriation
disorder in adults is 1.4%

or somewhat higher. Three-quarters or more of individuals with the
disorder are female.

This likely reflects the true gender ratio of the condition, although it
may also reflect differential treatment seeking based on gender or
cultural attitudes regarding appearance.

Development and Course

Although individuals with excoriation disorder may present at various
ages, the skin picking most often has onset during adolescence, commonly
coinciding with or following the onset of puberty. The disorder
frequently begins with a dermatological condition, such as acne. Sites
of skin picking may vary over time. The usual course is chronic, with
some waxing and waning if untreated. For some individuals, the disorder
may come and go for weeks, months, or years at a time.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Excoriation disorder is more common in individuals with
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their first-degree family
members than in the general population.

Diagnostic Markers

Most individuals with excoriation disorder admit to skin picking;
therefore, dermatopathological diagnosis is rarely required. However,
the disorder may have characteristic features on histopathology.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p301}**256**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

Functional Consequences of

Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder

Excoriation disorder is associated with distress as well as with social
and occupational impairment. The majority of individuals with this
condition spend at least 1 hour per day picking, thinking about picking,
and resisting urges to pick. Many individuals report avoiding social or
entertainment events as well as going out in public. A majority of
individuals with the disorder also report experiencing work interference
from skin picking on at least a daily or weekly basis. A significant
proportion of students with excoriation disorder report having missed
school, having experienced difficulties managing responsibilities at
school, or having had difficulties studying because of skin picking.
Medical complications of skin picking include tissue damage, scarring,
and infection and can be life-threatening. Rarely, synovitis of the
wrists due to chronic picking has been reported. Skin picking often
results in significant tissue damage and scarring. It frequently
requires antibiotic treatment for infection, and on occasion it may
require surgery.

Differential Diagnosis

Psychotic disorder.

Skin picking may occur in response to a delusion (i.e., parasitosis) or
tactile hallucination (i.e., formication) in a psychotic disorder. In
such cases, excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed.

Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

Excessive washing compulsions

in response to contamination obsessions in individuals with OCD may lead
to skin lesions, and skin picking may occur in individuals with body
dysmorphic disorder who pick their skin solely because of appearance
concerns; in such cases, excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed.
The description of body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other
specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder excludes individuals
whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for excoriation disorder.

Neurodevelopmental disorders.

While stereotypic movement disorder may be characterized by repetitive
self-injurious behavior, onset is in the early developmental period.

For example, individuals with the neurogenetic condition Prader-Willi
syndrome may have early onset of skin picking, and their symptoms may
meet criteria for stereotypic movement disorder. While tics in
individuals with Tourette's disorder may lead to self-injury, the
behavior is not tic-like in excoriation disorder.

Somatic symptom and related disorders.

Excoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the

skin lesion is primarily attributable to deceptive behaviors in
factitious disorder.

Other disorders.

Excoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily
attributable to the intention to harm oneself that is characteristic of
nonsuicidal self-injury.

Other medical conditions.

Excoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily
attributable to another medical condition. For example, scabies is a
dermatological condition invariably associated with severe itching and
scratching. However, excoriation disorder may be precipitated or
exacerbated by an underlying dermatological condition. For example, acne
may lead to some scratching and picking, which may also be associated
with comorbid excoriation disorder. The differentiation between these
two clinical situations (acne with some scratching and picking vs. acne
with comorbid excoriation disorder) requires an assessment of the extent
to which the individual's skin picking has become independent of the
underlying dermatological condition.

Substance/medication-induced disorders.

Skin-picking symptoms may also be induced

by certain substances (e.g., cocaine), in which case excoriation
disorder should not be diagnosed. If such skin picking is clinically
significant, then a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be considered.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p302}Substance/Medication-Induced
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder **257**

Comorbidity

Excoriation disorder is often accompanied by other mental disorders.
Such disorders include OCD and trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder),
as well as major depressive disorder. Repetitive body-focused symptoms
other than skin picking and hair pulling (e.g., nail biting) occur in
many individuals with excoriation disorder and may deserve an additional
diagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
(i.e., body-focused repetitive behavior disorder).

Substance/Medication-Induced

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. Obsessions, compulsions, skin picking, hair pulling, other
body-focused repetitive behaviors, or other symptoms characteristic of
the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders predominate in the
clinical picture.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):

1\. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance
intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.

2\. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the
symptoms in Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by an obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such
evidence of an independent obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the
substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period
of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or
severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence
of an independent nonsubstance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent
nonsubstance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of
substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in
Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently
severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-induced obsessive-compulsive and related
disorders are indicated in the table below.

Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a
comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance.
If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is
"1," and the clinician should record "mild \[substance\] use disorder"

before the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
(e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"). If a moderate or severe
substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is
"2," and the clinician should record "moderate \[substance\] use
disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder,"

depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), then the 4th position character is "9," and the clinician
should record only the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder.

**With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for
intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during
intoxication.

**With onset during withdrawal:** If criteria are met for withdrawal
from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after,
withdrawal.

**With onset after medication use:** Symptoms may appear either at
initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use.

Recording Procedures

ICD-9-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine) that
is presumed to be causing the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms.
The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria
set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit
into any of the classes, the code for "other substance" should be used;
and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor
but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown
substance" should be used.

The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset
after medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM,
which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder
into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for
the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of repetitive
behaviors occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine
use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 cocaine-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during
intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use
disorder is also given.

When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the
development of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, each
should be listed separately.

ICD-10-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine) that
is presumed to be causing the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms.
The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria
set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a
comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any
of the classes, the code for "other substance" with no comorbid
substance use should be used; and in cases in which a substance is
judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance
is unknown, the category "unknown substance" with no comorbid substance
use should be used.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p304}Substance/Medication-Induced
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder **259**

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during
intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use).
For example, in the case of repetitive behaviors occurring during
intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis
is F14.288 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during
intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use
disorder is not given. If the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g.,
after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance
use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.988 amphetamine-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during
intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of the obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder, each should be listed separately.

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder are prominent symptoms of an
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (Criterion A) that are judged
to be attributable to the effects of a substance (e.g., drug of abuse,
medication). The obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms must
have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal
or after exposure to a medication or toxin, and the substance/medication
must be capable of producing the symptoms (Criterion B).
Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or general medical
condition must have its onset while the individual is receiving the
medication. Once the treatment is discontinued, the obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder symptoms will usually improve or remit within days
to several weeks to 1 month (depending on the half-life of the
substance/medication). The diagnosis of substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should not be given if onset
of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms precedes the
substance intoxication or medication use, or if the symptoms persist for
a substantial period of time, usually longer than 1 month, from the time
of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder symptoms persist for a substantial period of time,
other causes for the symptoms should be considered. The
substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of substance
intoxication only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the
clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent
clinical attention Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Obsessions,
compulsions, hair pulling, skin picking, or other body-focused
repetitive behaviors can occur in association with intoxication with the
following classes of substances: stimulants (including cocaine) and
other (or unknown) substances. Heavy metals and toxins may also cause
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms. Laboratory
assessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be useful to measure substance
intoxication as part of an assessment for obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders.

Prevalence

In the general population, the very limited data that are available
indicate that substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder is very rare.

Differential Diagnosis

Substance intoxication.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms may occur in
substance intoxication. The diagnosis of the substance-specific
intoxication will usu-

[]{#index_split_027.html#p305}**260**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

ally suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of an
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be made in addition to
substance intoxication when the symptoms are judged to be in excess of
those usually associated with intoxication and are sufficiently severe
to warrant independent clinical attention.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i.e., not induced by a
substance).

Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
is judged to be etiologically related to the substance/medication.
Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
is distinguished from a primary obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors with
respect to substances/medications. For drugs of abuse, there must be
evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings
for use or intoxication. Substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder arises only in association
with intoxication, whereas a primary obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder may precede the onset of substance/medication use. The presence
of features that are atypical of a primary obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder, such as atypical age at onset of symptoms, may suggest
a substance-induced etiology. A primary obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder diagnosis is warranted if the symptoms persist for a
substantial period of time (about 1 month or longer) after the end of
the substance intoxication or the individual has a history of an
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition.

If the

obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms are attributable to
another medical condition (i.e., rather than to the medication taken for
the other medical condition), obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
due to another medical condition should be diagnosed. The history often
provides the basis for judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for
the other medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or
discontinuation) may be needed to determine whether or not the
medication is the causative agent (in which case the symptoms may be
better explained by substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both
another medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e.,
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition and substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to
determine whether the symptoms are attributable to either a
substance/medication or another medical condition or are primary (i.e.,
attributable to neither a substance/medication nor another medical
condition), a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder would be indicated.

Delirium.

If obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms occur exclusively
during the course of delirium, they are considered to be an associated
feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately.

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

*Specify* if:

**With obsessive-compulsive disorder--like symptoms:** If
obsessive-compulsive disorder--like symptoms predominate in the clinical
presentation.

**With appearance preoccupations:** If preoccupation with perceived
appearance defects or flaws predominates in the clinical presentation.

**With hoarding symptoms:** If hoarding predominates in the clinical
presentation.

**With hair-pulling symptoms:** If hair pulling predominates in the
clinical presentation.

**With skin-picking symptoms:** If skin picking predominates in the
clinical presentation.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the
name of the mental disorder (e.g., 294.8 \[F06.8\] obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder due to cerebral infarction). The other medical
condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to the medical condition
(e.g., 438.89 \[I69.398\] cerebral infarction; 294.8 \[F06.8\]
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction).

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due
to another medical condition is clinically significant
obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms that are judged to be best
explained as the direct pathophysiological consequence of another
medical condition. Symptoms can include prominent obsessions,
compulsions, preoccupations with appearance, hoarding, hair pulling,
skin picking, or other body-focused repetitive behaviors (Criterion A).
The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated
medical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must
be judged that the symptoms are not better explained by another mental
disorder (Criterion C). The diagnosis is not made if the
obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms occur only during the course
of a delirium (Criterion D). The obsessive-compulsive and related
symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion
E).

In determining whether the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are
attributable to another medical condition, a relevant medical condition
must be present. Furthermore, it must be established that
obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms can be etiologically related
to the medical condition through a pathophysiological mechanism and that
this best explains the symptoms in the individual. Although there are no
infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between
the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms and the medical condition
is etiological, considerations that may provide some guidance in making
this diagnosis include the presence of a clear temporal association
between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition
and the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms; the presence of
features that are atypical of a primary obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course); and evidence in the
literature that a known physiological mechanism (e.g., striatal damage)
causes obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. In addition, the
disturbance cannot be better explained by a primary obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder, a substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, or another mental disorder.

There is some controversy about whether obsessive-compulsive and related
disorders can be attributed to Group A streptococcal infection.
Sydenham's chorea is the neurolog-

[]{#index_split_027.html#p307}**262**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

ical manifestation of rheumatic fever, which is in turn due to Group A
streptococcal infection. Sydenham's chorea is characterized by a
combination of motor and nonmotor features. Nonmotor features include
obsessions, compulsions, attention deficit, and emotional lability.
Although individuals with Sydenham's chorea may present with
non-neuropsychiatric features of acute rheumatic fever, such as carditis
and arthritis, they may present with obsessive-compulsive disorder--like
symptoms; such individuals should be diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder due to another medical condition.

Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with
streptococcal infections (PANDAS) has been identified as another
post-infectious autoimmune disorder characterized by the sudden onset of
obsessions, compulsions, and/or tics accompanied by a variety of acute
neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of chorea, carditis, or
arthritis, after Group A streptococcal infection. Although there is a
body of evidence that supports the existence of PANDAS, it remains a
controversial diagnosis. Given this ongoing controversy, the description
of PANDAS has been modified to eliminate etiological factors and to
designate an expanded clinical entity: pediatric acute-onset
neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) or idiopathic childhood acute
neuropsychiatric symptoms (CANS), which deserves further study.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A number of other medical disorders are known to include
obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms as a manifestation. Examples
include disorders leading to striatal damage, such as cerebral
infarction.

Development and Course

The development and course of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
due to another medical condition generally follows the course of the
underlying illness.

Diagnostic Markers

Laboratory assessments and/or medical examinations are necessary to
confirm the diagnosis of another medical condition.

Differential Diagnosis

Delirium.

A separate diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to
another medical condition is not given if the disturbance occurs
exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major
neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of the
obsessive-compulsive symptoms is judged to be a physiological
consequence of the pathological process causing the dementia and if
obsessive-compulsive symptoms are a prominent part of the clinical
presentation.

Mixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder symptoms).

If the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms, the
specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on
which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture.

Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

If there

is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including medications
with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to
a toxin, a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder should be considered. When a substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is being diagnosed in relation
to drugs of abuse, it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug
screen []{#index_split_027.html#p308}Other Specified
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder **263**

or other appropriate laboratory evaluation. Symptoms that occur during
or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication or
withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a
substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,
depending on the type, duration, or amount of the substance used.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (primary).

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition should be distinguished from a primary obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder. In primary mental disorders, no specific and
direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical
condition can be demonstrated. Late age at onset or atypical symptoms
suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition.

Illness anxiety disorder.

Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by a preoccupation with having
or acquiring a serious illness. In the case of illness anxiety disorder,
individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions.

Associated feature of another mental disorder.

Obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms may be an associated feature
of another mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa).

Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder or unspecified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.

These diagnoses are given if it is unclear whether the
obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are primary,
substance-induced, or due to another medical condition.

Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive

and Related Disorder

**300.3 (F42)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder category is used in situations
in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that
the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. This is done by recording
"other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder" followed by
the specific reason (e.g., "body-focused repetitive behavior disorder").

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following:

1\. **Body dysmorphic--like disorder with actual flaws:** This is
similar to body dysmorphic disorder except that the defects or flaws in
physical appearance are clearly observable by others (i.e., they are
more noticeable than "slight"). In such cases, the preoccupation with
these flaws is clearly excessive and causes significant impairment or
distress.

2\. **Body dysmorphic--like disorder without repetitive behaviors:**
Presentations that meet body dysmorphic disorder except that the
individual has not performed repetitive behaviors or mental acts in
response to the appearance concerns.

3\. **Body-focused repetitive behavior disorder:** This is characterized
by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., nail biting, lip
biting, cheek chewing) and repeated attempts to decrease or stop the
behaviors. These symptoms cause clinically significant

[]{#index_split_027.html#p309}**264**

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning and are not better explained by trichotillomania
(hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder,
stereotypic movement disorder, or nonsuicidal self-injury.

4\. **Obsessional jealousy:** This is characterized by nondelusional
preoccupation with a partner's perceived infidelity. The preoccupations
may lead to repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the
infidelity concerns; they cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning; and they are not better explained by another mental
disorder such as delusional disorder, jealous type, or paranoid
personality disorder.

5\. ***Shubo-kyofu:*** A variant of *taijin kyofusho* (see "Glossary of
Cultural Concepts of Distress" in the Appendix) that is similar to body
dysmorphic disorder and is characterized by excessive fear of having a
bodily deformity.

6\. ***Koro:*** Related to *dhat syndrome* (see "Glossary of Cultural
Concepts of Distress" in the Appendix), an episode of sudden and intense
anxiety that the penis (or the vulva and nipples in females) will recede
into the body, possibly leading to death.

7\. ***Jikoshu-kyofu:*** A variant of *taijin kyofusho* (see "Glossary
of Cultural Concepts of Distress" in the Appendix) characterized by fear
of having an offensive body odor (also termed *olfactory reference
syndrome*).

Unspecified Obsessive-Compulsive

and Related Disorder

**300.3 (F42)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, and
includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to
make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

[]{#index_split_027.html#p310}**Trauma-and**

**Stressor-Related Disorders**

Trauma-and stressor-related disorders include disorders in which
exposure to a traumatic or stressful event is listed explicitly as a
diagnostic criterion. These include reactive attachment disorder,
disinhibited social engagement disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), acute stress disorder, and adjustment disorders. Placement of
this chapter reflects the close relationship between these diagnoses and
disorders in the surrounding chapters on anxiety disorders,
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and dissociative disorders.

Psychological distress following exposure to a traumatic or stressful
event is quite variable. In some cases, symptoms can be well understood
within an anxiety-or fear-based context. It is clear, however, that many
individuals who have been exposed to a traumatic or stressful event
exhibit a phenotype in which, rather than anxiety-or fear-based
symptoms, the most prominent clinical characteristics are anhedonic and
dysphoric symptoms, externalizing angry and aggressive symptoms, or
dissociative symptoms. Because of these variable expressions of clinical
distress following exposure to catastrophic or aversive events, the
aforementioned disorders have been grouped under a separate category:
*trauma-and stressor-related disorders.* Furthermore, it is not uncommon
for the clinical picture to include some combination of the above
symptoms (with or without anxiety-or fear-based symptoms). Such a
heterogeneous picture has long been recognized in adjustment disorders,
as well. Social neglect---that is, the absence of adequate caregiving
during childhood---is a diagnostic requirement of both reactive
attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder.
Although the two disorders share a common etiology, the former is
expressed as an internalizing disorder with depressive symptoms and
withdrawn behavior, while the latter is marked by disinhibition and
externalizing behavior.

Reactive Attachment Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**313.89 (F94.1)**

A. A consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior
toward adult caregivers, manifested by both of the following:

1\. The child rarely or minimally seeks comfort when distressed.

2\. The child rarely or minimally responds to comfort when distressed.

B. A persistent social and emotional disturbance characterized by at
least two of the following: 1. Minimal social and emotional
responsiveness to others.

2\. Limited positive affect.

3\. Episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness, or fearfulness that
are evident even during nonthreatening interactions with adult
caregivers.

C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care
as evidenced by at least one of the following:

1\. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of
having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met
by caregiving adults.

**265**

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

2\. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportunities to
form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).

3\. Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to
form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with high
child-to-caregiver ratios).

D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the
disturbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A
began following the lack of adequate care in Criterion C).

E. The criteria are not met for autism spectrum disorder.

F. The disturbance is evident before age 5 years.

G. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months.

*Specify* if:

**Persistent:** The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.

*Specify* current severity:

Reactive attachment disorder is specified as **severe** when a child
exhibits all symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at
relatively high levels.

Diagnostic Features

Reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood is
characterized by a pattern of markedly disturbed and developmentally
inappropriate attachment behaviors, in which a child rarely or minimally
turns preferentially to an attachment figure for comfort, support,
protection, and nurturance. The essential feature is absent or grossly
underdeveloped attachment between the child and putative caregiving
adults. Children with reactive attachment disorder are believed to have
the capacity to form selective attachments. However, because of limited
opportunities during early development, they fail to show the behavioral
manifestations of selective attachments. That is, when distressed, they
show no consistent effort to obtain comfort, support, nurturance, or
protection from caregivers. Furthermore, when distressed, children with
this disorder do not respond more than minimally to comforting efforts
of caregivers. Thus, the disorder is associated with the absence of
expected comfort seeking and response to comforting behaviors. As such,
children with reactive attachment disorder show diminished or absent
expression of positive emotions during routine interactions with
caregivers. In addition, their emotion regulation capacity is
compromised, and they display episodes of negative emotions of fear,
sadness, or irritability that are not readily explained. A diagnosis of
reactive attachment disorder should not be made in children who are
developmentally unable to form selective attachments. For this reason,
the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Because of the shared etiological association with social neglect,
reactive attachment disorder often co-occurs with developmental delays,
especially in delays in cognition and language. Other associated
features include stereotypies and other signs of severe neglect (e.g.,
malnutrition or signs of poor care).

Prevalence

The prevalence of reactive attachment disorder is unknown, but the
disorder is seen relatively rarely in clinical settings. The disorder
has been found in young children exposed to severe neglect before being
placed in foster care or raised in institutions. However, even in
populations of severely neglected children, the disorder is uncommon,
occurring in less than 10% of such children.

[]{#index_split_027.html#p312}Reactive Attachment Disorder

**267**

Development and Course

Conditions of social neglect are often present in the first months of
life in children diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, even
before the disorder is diagnosed. The clinical features of the disorder
manifest in a similar fashion between the ages of 9 months and 5 years.
That is, signs of absent-to-minimal attachment behaviors and associated
emotionally aberrant behaviors are evident in children throughout this
age range, although differing cognitive and motor abilities may affect
how these behaviors are expressed. Without remediation and recovery
through normative caregiving environments, it appears that signs of the
disorder may persist, at least for several years.

It is unclear whether reactive attachment disorder occurs in older
children and, if so, how it differs from its presentation in young
children. Because of this, the diagnosis should be made with caution in
children older than 5 years.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Serious social neglect is a diagnostic requirement for reactive
attachment disorder and is also the only known risk factor for the
disorder. However, the majority of severely neglected children do not
develop the disorder. Prognosis appears to depend on the quality of the
caregiving environment following serious neglect.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Similar attachment behaviors have been described in young children in
many different cultures around the world. However, caution should be
exercised in making the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder in
cultures in which attachment has not been studied.

Functional Consequences of

Reactive Attachment Disorder

Reactive attachment disorder significantly impairs young children's
abilities to relate interpersonally to adults or peers and is associated
with functional impairment across many domains of early childhood.

Differential Diagnosis

Autism spectrum disorder.

Aberrant social behaviors manifest in young children with reactive
attachment disorder, but they also are key features of autism spectrum
disorder.

Specifically, young children with either condition can manifest dampened
expression of positive emotions, cognitive and language delays, and
impairments in social reciprocity.

As a result, reactive attachment disorder must be differentiated from
autism spectrum disorder. These two disorders can be distinguished based
on differential histories of neglect and on the presence of restricted
interests or ritualized behaviors, specific deficit in social
communication, and selective attachment behaviors. Children with
reactive attachment disorder have experienced a history of severe social
neglect, although it is not always possible to obtain detailed histories
about the precise nature of their experiences, especially in initial
evaluations. Children with autistic spectrum disorder will only rarely
have a history of social neglect. The restricted interests and
repetitive behaviors characteristic of autism spectrum disorder are not
a feature of reactive attachment disorder. These clinical features
manifest as excessive adherence to rituals and routines; restricted,
fixated interests; and unusual sensory reactions. However, it is
important to note that children with either condition can exhibit
stereotypic behaviors such as rocking or flapping. Children with either
disorder also may exhibit a range of intellectual functioning, but only
children with autis-

[]{#index_split_027.html#p313}**268**

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

tic spectrum disorder exhibit selective impairments in social
communicative behaviors, such as intentional communication (i.e.,
impairment in communication that is deliberate, goal-directed, and aimed
at influencing the behavior of the recipient). Children with reactive
attachment disorder show social communicative functioning comparable to
their overall level of intellectual functioning. Finally, children with
autistic spectrum disorder regularly show attachment behavior typical
for their developmental level. In contrast, children with reactive
attachment disorder do so only rarely or inconsistently, if at all.

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).

Developmental delays often accompany reactive attachment disorder, but
they should not be confused with the disorder. Children with
intellectual disability should exhibit social and emotional skills
comparable to their cognitive skills and do not demonstrate the profound
reduction in positive affect and emotion regulation difficulties evident
in children with reactive attachment disorder. In addition,
developmentally delayed children who have reached a cognitive age of
7--9 months should demonstrate selective attachments regardless of their
chronological age. In contrast, children with reactive attachment
disorder show lack of preferred attachment despite having attained a
developmental age of at least 9 months.

Depressive disorders.

Depression in young children is also associated with reductions in
positive affect. There is limited evidence, however, to suggest that
children with depressive disorders have impairments in attachment. That
is, young children who have been diagnosed with depressive disorders
still should seek and respond to comforting efforts by caregivers.

Comorbidity

Conditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays, language
delays, and stereotypies, often co-occur with reactive attachment
disorder. Medical conditions, such as severe malnutrition, may accompany
signs of the disorder. Depressive symptoms also may co-occur with
reactive attachment disorder.

Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**313.89 (F94.2)**

A. A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and
interacts with unfamiliar adults and exhibits at least two of the
following:

1\. Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with
unfamiliar adults.

2\. Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (that is not consistent
with culturally sanctioned and with age-appropriate social boundaries).

3\. Diminished or absent checking back with adult caregiver after
venturing away, even in unfamiliar settings.

[]{#index_split_028.html}

4\. Willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with minimal or no
hesitation.

B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) but include socially
disinhibited behavior.

C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care
as evidenced by at least one of the following:

1\. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of
having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met
by caregiving adults.

2\. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportunities to
form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).

3\. Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to
form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with high
child-to-caregiver ratios).

[]{#index_split_028.html#p314}Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder
**269**

D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the
disturbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A
began following the pathogenic care in Criterion C).

E. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months.

*Specify* if:

**Persistent:** The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.

*Specify* current severity:

Disinhibited social engagement disorder is specified as **severe** when
the child exhibits all symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom
manifesting at relatively high levels.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of disinhibited social engagement disorder is a
pattern of behavior that involves culturally inappropriate, overly
familiar behavior with relative strangers (Criterion A). This overly
familiar behavior violates the social boundaries of the culture. A
diagnosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder should not be made
before children are developmentally able to form selective attachments.
For this reason, the child must have a developmental age of at least 9
months.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Because of the shared etiological association with social neglect,
disinhibited social engagement disorder may co-occur with developmental
delays, especially cognitive and language delays, stereotypies, and
other signs of severe neglect, such as malnutrition or poor care.
However, signs of the disorder often persist even after these other
signs of neglect are no longer present. Therefore, it is not uncommon
for children with the disorder to present with no current signs of
neglect. Moreover, the condition can present in children who show no
signs of disordered attachment. Thus, disinhibited social engagement
disorder may be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack
attachments or whose attachments to their caregivers range from
disturbed to secure.

Prevalence

The prevalence of disinhibited social attachment disorder is unknown.
Nevertheless, the disorder appears to be rare, occurring in a minority
of children, even those who have been severely neglected and
subsequently placed in foster care or raised in institutions. In such
high-risk populations, the condition occurs in only about 20% of
children. The condition is seen rarely in other clinical settings.

Development and Course

Conditions of social neglect are often present in the first months of
life in children diagnosed with disinhibited social engagement disorder,
even before the disorder is diagnosed. However, there is no evidence
that neglect beginning after age 2 years is associated with
manifestations of the disorder. If neglect occurs early and signs of the
disorder appear, clinical features of the disorder are moderately stable
over time, particularly if conditions of neglect persist. Indiscriminate
social behavior and lack of reticence with unfamiliar adults in
toddlerhood are accompanied by attention-seeking behaviors in
preschoolers. When the disorder persists into middle childhood, clinical
features manifest as verbal and physical overfamiliarity as well as
inauthentic expression of emotions. These signs appear particularly
apparent when the child interacts with adults. Peer relationships are
most affected in adolescence, with both indiscriminate behavior and
conflicts apparent. The disorder has not been described in adults.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p315}**270**

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

Disinhibited social engagement disorder has been described from the
second year of life through adolescence. There are some differences in
manifestations of the disorder from early childhood through adolescence.
At the youngest ages, across many cultures, children show reticence when
interacting with strangers. Young children with the disorder fail to
show reticence to approach, engage with, and even accompany adults. In
preschool children, verbal and social intrusiveness appear most
prominent, often accompanied by attention-seeking behavior. Verbal and
physical overfamiliarity continue through middle childhood, accompanied
by inauthentic expressions of emotion. In adolescence, indiscriminate
behavior extends to peers. Relative to healthy adolescents, adolescents
with the disorder have more "superficial" peer relationships and more
peer conflicts. Adult manifestations of the disorder are unknown.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Serious social neglect is a diagnostic requirement for disinhibited
social engagement disorder and is also the only known risk factor for
the disorder. However, the majority of severely neglected children do
not develop the disorder. Neurobiological vulnerability may
differentiate neglected children who do and do not develop the disorder.

However, no clear link with any specific neurobiological factors has
been established. The disorder has not been identified in children who
experience social neglect only after age 2 years. Prognosis is only
modestly associated with quality of the caregiving environment following
serious neglect. In many cases, the disorder persists, even in children
whose caregiving environment becomes markedly improved.

Course modifiers.

Caregiving quality seems to moderate the course of disinhibited social
engagement disorder. Nevertheless, even after placement in normative
caregiving environments, some children show persistent signs of the
disorder, at least through adolescence.

Functional Consequences of

Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder

Disinhibited social engagement disorder significantly impairs young
children's abilities to relate interpersonally to adults and peers.

Differential Diagnosis

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Because of social impulsivity that sometimes

accompanies attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it is
necessary to differentiate the two disorders. Children with disinhibited
social engagement disorder may be distinguished from those with ADHD
because the former do not show difficulties with attention or
hyperactivity.

Comorbidity

Limited research has examined the issue of disorders comorbid with
disinhibited social engagement disorder. Conditions associated with
neglect, including cognitive delays, language delays, and stereotypies,
may co-occur with disinhibited social engagement disorder. In addition,
children may be diagnosed with ADHD and disinhibited social engagement
disorder concurrently.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the
development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to one or more
traumatic events. Emotional reactions to the traumatic event (e.g.,
fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part of Criterion A. The
clinical presentation of PTSD varies. In some individuals, fear-based
reexperiencing, emotional, and behavioral symptoms may predominate. In
others, anhedonic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may
be most distressing. In some other individuals, arousal and
reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in others,
dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit
combinations of these symptom patterns.

The directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but
are not limited to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian,
threatened or actual physical assault (e.g., physical attack, robbery,
mugging, childhood physical abuse), threatened or actual sexual violence
(e.g., forced sexual penetration, alcohol/drug-facilitated sexual
penetration, abusive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse, sexual
trafficking), being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack,
torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or human-made
disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. For children, sexually
violent events may include developmentally inappropriate sexual
experiences without physical violence or injury. A life-threatening
illness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered
a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events
involve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery,
anaphylactic shock).

Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened
or serious injury, unnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another
person due to violent assault, domestic violence, accident, war or
disaster, or a medical catastrophe in one's child (e.g., a
life-threatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure through learning about
an event is limited to experiences affecting close relatives or friends
and experiences that are violent or accidental (e.g., death due to
natural causes does not qualify). Such events include violent per-

[]{#index_split_028.html#p320}Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

**275**

sonal assault, suicide, serious accident, and serious injury. The
disorder may be especially severe or long-lasting when the stressor is
interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, sexual violence).

The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the
individual has recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of
the event (Criterion B1). Intrusive recollections in PTSD are
distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply only to
involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is on
recurrent memories of the event that usually include sensory, emotional,
or physiological behavioral components. A common reexperiencing symptom
is distressing dreams that replay the event itself or that are
representative or thematically related to the major threats involved in
the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The individual may experience
dissociative states that last from a few seconds to several hours or
even days, during which components of the event are relived and the
individual behaves as if the event were occurring at that moment
(Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum from brief visual or
other sensory intrusions about part of the traumatic event without loss
of reality orientation, to complete loss of awareness of present
surroundings. These episodes, often referred to as "flashbacks," are
typically brief but can be associated with prolonged distress and
heightened arousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to
trauma may appear in play or in dissociative states. Intense
psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological reactivity
(Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering
events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event
(e.g., windy days after a hurricane; seeing someone who resembles one's
perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g.,
dizziness for survivors of head trauma; rapid heartbeat for a previously
traumatized child), particularly for individuals with highly somatic
presentations.

Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently (e.g., always or
almost always) avoided. The individual commonly makes deliberate efforts
to avoid thoughts, memories, feelings, or talking about the traumatic
event (e.g., utilizing distraction techniques to avoid internal
reminders) (Criterion C1) and to avoid activities, objects, situations,
or people who arouse recollections of it (Criterion C2).

Negative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the event
begin or worsen after exposure to the event. These negative alterations
can take various forms, including an inability to remember an important
aspect of the traumatic event; such amnesia is typically due to
dissociative amnesia and is not due to head injury, alcohol, or drugs
(Criterion D1).

Another form is persistent (i.e., always or almost always) and
exaggerated negative expectations regarding important aspects of life
applied to oneself, others, or the future (e.g.,

"I have always had bad judgment"; "People in authority can't be
trusted") that may manifest as a negative change in perceived identity
since the trauma (e.g., "I can't trust anyone ever again"; Criterion
D2). Individuals with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cognitions
about the causes of the traumatic event that lead them to blame
themselves or others (e.g., "It's all my fault that my uncle abused me")
(Criterion D3). A persistent negative mood state (e.g., fear, horror,
anger, guilt, shame) either began or worsened after exposure to the
event (Criterion D4). The individual may experience markedly diminished
interest or participation in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion
D5), feeling detached or estranged from other people (Criterion D6), or
a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (especially happiness,
joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, and
sexuality) (Criterion D7).

Individuals with PTSD may be quick tempered and may even engage in
aggressive verbal and/or physical behavior with little or no provocation
(e.g., yelling at people, getting into fights, destroying objects)
(Criterion E1). They may also engage in reckless or self-destructive
behavior such as dangerous driving, excessive alcohol or drug use, or
self-injurious or suicidal behavior (Criterion E2). PTSD is often
characterized by a heightened sensitivity to potential threats,
including those that are related to the traumatic experience (e.g.,
following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the
threat potentially []{#index_split_028.html#p321}**276**

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

caused by cars or trucks) and those not related to the traumatic event
(e.g., being fearful of suffering a heart attack) (Criterion E3).
Individuals with PTSD may be very reactive to unexpected stimuli,
displaying a heightened startle response, or jumpiness, to loud noises
or unexpected movements (e.g., jumping markedly in response to a
telephone ringing) (Criterion E4). Concentration difficulties, including
difficulty remembering daily events (e.g., forgetting one's telephone
number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g., following a conversation
for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported (Criterion E5).
Problems with sleep onset and maintenance are common and may be
associated with nightmares and safety concerns or with generalized
elevated arousal that interferes with adequate sleep (Criterion E6).
Some individuals also experience persistent dissociative symptoms of
detachment from their bodies (depersonalization) or the world around
them (derealization); this is reflected in the "with dissociative
symptoms" specifier.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Developmental regression, such as loss of language in young children,
may occur. Auditory pseudo-hallucinations, such as having the sensory
experience of hearing one's thoughts spoken in one or more different
voices, as well as paranoid ideation, can be present. Following
prolonged, repeated, and severe traumatic events (e.g., childhood abuse,
torture), the individual may additionally experience difficulties in
regulating emotions or maintaining stable interpersonal relationships,
or dissociative symptoms. When the traumatic event produces violent
death, symptoms of both problematic bereavement and PTSD

may be present.

Prevalence

In the United States, projected lifetime risk for PTSD using DSM-IV
criteria at age 75 years is 8.7%. Twelve-month prevalence among U.S.
adults is about 3.5%. Lower estimates are seen in Europe and most Asian,
African, and Latin American countries, clustering around 0.5%--1.0%.
Although different groups have different levels of exposure to traumatic
events, the conditional probability of developing PTSD following a
similar level of exposure may also vary across cultural groups. Rates of
PTSD are higher among veterans and others whose vocation increases the
risk of traumatic exposure (e.g., police, firefighters, emergency
medical personnel). Highest rates (ranging from one-third to more than
one-half of those exposed) are found among survivors of rape, military
combat and captivity, and ethnically or politically motivated internment
and genocide. The prevalence of PTSD

may vary across development; children and adolescents, including
preschool children, generally have displayed lower prevalence following
exposure to serious traumatic events; however, this may be because
previous criteria were insufficiently developmentally informed. The
prevalence of full-threshold PTSD also appears to be lower among older
adults compared with the general population; there is evidence that
subthreshold presentations are more common than full PTSD in later life
and that these symptoms are associated with substantial clinical
impairment. Compared with U.S. non-Latino whites, higher rates of PTSD
have been reported among U.S. Latinos, African Americans, and American
Indians, and lower rates have been reported among Asian Americans, after
adjustment for traumatic exposure and demographic variables.

Development and Course

PTSD can occur at any age, beginning after the first year of life.
Symptoms usually begin within the first 3 months after the trauma,
although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before criteria
for the diagnosis are met. There is abundant evidence for what DSM-IV
called "delayed onset" but is now called "delayed expression," with the
recognition that some symptoms typically appear immediately and that the
delay is in meeting full criteria.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p322}Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

**277**

Frequently, an individual's reaction to a trauma initially meets
criteria for acute stress disorder in the immediate aftermath of the
trauma. The symptoms of PTSD and the relative predominance of different
symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the symptoms also varies, with
complete recovery within 3 months occurring in approximately one-half of
adults, while some individuals remain symptomatic for longer than 12
months and sometimes for more than 50 years. Symptom recurrence and
intensification may occur in response to reminders of the original
trauma, ongoing life stressors, or newly experienced traumatic events.
For older individuals, declining health, worsening cognitive
functioning, and social isolation may exacerbate PTSD symptoms.

The clinical expression of reexperiencing can vary across development.
Young children may report new onset of frightening dreams without
content specific to the traumatic event.

Before age 6 years (see criteria for preschool subtype), young children
are more likely to express reexperiencing symptoms through play that
refers directly or symbolically to the trauma. They may not manifest
fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or during reexperiencing.
Parents may report a wide range of emotional or behavioral changes in
young children. Children may focus on imagined interventions in their
play or storytelling. In addition to avoidance, children may become
preoccupied with reminders. Because of young children's limitations in
expressing thoughts or labeling emotions, negative alterations in mood
or cognition tend to involve primarily mood changes. Children may
experience co-occurring traumas (e.g., physical abuse, witnessing
domestic violence) and in chronic circumstances may not be able to
identify onset of symptomatology. Avoidant behavior may be associated
with restricted play or exploratory behavior in young children; reduced
participation in new activities in school-age children; or reluctance to
pursue developmental opportunities in adolescents (e.g., dating,
driving). Older children and adolescents may judge themselves as
cowardly. Adolescents may harbor beliefs of being changed in ways that
make them socially undesirable and estrange them from peers (e.g., "Now
I'll never fit in") and lose aspirations for the future. Irritable or
aggressive behavior in children and adolescents can interfere with peer
relationships and school behavior. Reckless behavior may lead to
accidental injury to self or others, thrill-seeking, or high-risk
behaviors. Individuals who continue to experience PTSD into older
adulthood may express fewer symptoms of hyperarousal, avoidance, and
negative cognitions and mood compared with younger adults with PTSD,
although adults exposed to traumatic events during later life may
display more avoidance, hyperarousal, sleep problems, and crying spells
than do younger adults exposed to the same traumatic events. In older
individuals, the disorder is associated with negative health
perceptions, primary care utilization, and suicidal ideation.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Risk (and protective) factors are generally divided into pretraumatic,
peritraumatic, and posttraumatic factors.

**Pretraumatic factors**

Temperamental.

These include childhood emotional problems by age 6 years (e.g., prior
traumatic exposure, externalizing or anxiety problems) and prior mental
disorders (e.g., panic disorder, depressive disorder, PTSD, or
obsessive-compulsive disorder \[OCD\]).

Environmental.

These include lower socioeconomic status; lower education; exposure to
prior trauma (especially during childhood); childhood adversity (e.g.,
economic deprivation, family dysfunction, parental separation or death);
cultural characteristics (e.g., fatal-istic or self-blaming coping
strategies); lower intelligence; minority racial/ethnic status; and a
family psychiatric history. Social support prior to event exposure is
protective.

Genetic and physiological.

These include female gender and younger age at the time of trauma
exposure (for adults). Certain genotypes may either be protective or
increase risk of PTSD after exposure to traumatic events.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p323}**278**

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

**Peritraumatic factors**

Environmental.

These include severity (dose) of the trauma (the greater the magnitude
of trauma, the greater the likelihood of PTSD), perceived life threat,
personal injury, interpersonal violence (particularly trauma perpetrated
by a caregiver or involving a witnessed threat to a caregiver in
children), and, for military personnel, being a perpetrator, witnessing
atrocities, or killing the enemy. Finally, dissociation that occurs
during the trauma and persists afterward is a risk factor.

**Posttraumatic factors**

Temperamental.

These include negative appraisals, inappropriate coping strategies, and
development of acute stress disorder.

Environmental.

These include subsequent exposure to repeated upsetting reminders,
subsequent adverse life events, and financial or other trauma-related
losses. Social support (including family stability, for children) is a
protective factor that moderates outcome after trauma.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The risk of onset and severity of PTSD may differ across cultural groups
as a result of variation in the type of traumatic exposure (e.g.,
genocide), the impact on disorder severity of the meaning attributed to
the traumatic event (e.g., inability to perform funerary rites after a
mass killing), the ongoing sociocultural context (e.g., residing among
unpunished perpetrators in postconflict settings), and other cultural
factors (e.g., acculturative stress in immigrants). The relative risk
for PTSD of particular exposures (e.g., religious persecution) may vary
across cultural groups. The clinical expression of the symptoms or
symptom clusters of PTSD may vary culturally, particularly with respect
to avoidance and numbing symptoms, distressing dreams, and somatic
symptoms (e.g., dizziness, shortness of breath, heat sensations).

Cultural syndromes and idioms of distress influence the expression of
PTSD and the range of comorbid disorders in different cultures by
providing behavioral and cognitive templates that link traumatic
exposures to specific symptoms. For example, panic attack symptoms may
be salient in PTSD among Cambodians and Latin Americans because of the
association of traumatic exposure with panic-like *khyâl* attacks and
*ataque de nervios*.

Comprehensive evaluation of local expressions of PTSD should include
assessment of cultural concepts of distress (see the chapter "Cultural
Formulation" in Section III).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

PTSD is more prevalent among females than among males across the
lifespan. Females in the general population experience PTSD for a longer
duration than do males. At least some of the increased risk for PTSD in
females appears to be attributable to a greater likelihood of exposure
to traumatic events, such as rape, and other forms of interpersonal
violence.

Within populations exposed specifically to such stressors, gender
differences in risk for PTSD are attenuated or nonsignificant.

Suicide Risk

Traumatic events such as childhood abuse increase a person's suicide
risk. PTSD is associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts,
and presence of the disorder may indicate which individuals with
ideation eventually make a suicide plan or actually attempt suicide.

Functional Consequences of

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

PTSD is associated with high levels of social, occupational, and
physical disability, as well as considerable economic costs and high
levels of medical utilization. Impaired function-

[]{#index_split_028.html#p324}Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

**279**

ing is exhibited across social, interpersonal, developmental,
educational, physical health, and occupational domains. In community and
veteran samples, PTSD is associated with poor social and family
relationships, absenteeism from work, lower income, and lower
educational and occupational success.

Differential Diagnosis

Adjustment disorders.

In adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity or type
rather than that required by PTSD Criterion A. The diagnosis of an
adjustment disorder is used when the response to a stressor that meets
PTSD Criterion A does not meet all other PTSD criteria (or criteria for
another mental disorder). An adjustment disorder is also diagnosed when
the symptom pattern of PTSD occurs in response to a stressor that does
not meet PTSD Criterion A (e.g., spouse leaving, being fired).

Other posttraumatic disorders and conditions.

Not all psychopathology that occurs in

individuals exposed to an extreme stressor should necessarily be
attributed to PTSD. The diagnosis requires that trauma exposure precede
the onset or exacerbation of pertinent symptoms. Moreover, if the
symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets criteria for
another mental disorder, these diagnoses should be given instead of, or
in addition to, PTSD. Other diagnoses and conditions are excluded if
they are better explained by PTSD (e.g., symptoms of panic disorder that
occur only after exposure to traumatic reminders). If severe, symptom
response patterns to the extreme stressor may warrant a separate
diagnosis (e.g., dissociative amnesia).

Acute stress disorder.

Acute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the symptom
pattern in acute stress disorder is restricted to a duration of 3 days
to 1 month following exposure to the traumatic event.

Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

In OCD, there are recurrent

intrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In
addition, the intrusive thoughts are not related to an experienced
traumatic event, compulsions are usually present, and other symptoms of
PTSD or acute stress disorder are typically absent. Neither the arousal
and dissociative symptoms of panic disorder nor the avoidance,
irritability, and anxiety of generalized anxiety disorder are associated
with a specific traumatic event. The symptoms of separation anxiety
disorder are clearly related to separation from home or family, rather
than to a traumatic event.

Major depressive disorder.

Major depression may or may not be preceded by a traumatic event and
should be diagnosed if other PTSD symptoms are absent. Specifically,
major depressive disorder does not include any PTSD Criterion B or C
symptoms. Nor does it include a number of symptoms from PTSD Criterion D
or E.

Personality disorders.

Interpersonal difficulties that had their onset, or were greatly
exacerbated, after exposure to a traumatic event may be an indication of
PTSD, rather than a personality disorder, in which such difficulties
would be expected independently of any traumatic exposure.

Dissociative disorders.

Dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and
depersonalization-derealization disorder may or may not be preceded by
exposure to a traumatic event or may or may not have co-occurring PTSD
symptoms. When full PTSD criteria are also met, however, the PTSD "with
dissociative symptoms" subtype should be considered.

Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).

New onset of somatic

symptoms within the context of posttraumatic distress might be an
indication of PTSD

rather than conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom
disorder).

Psychotic disorders.

Flashbacks in PTSD must be distinguished from illusions, hallucinations,
and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, brief
psychotic disorder, and other psychotic disorders; depressive and
bipolar disorders with

[]{#index_split_028.html#p325}**280**

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

psychotic features; delirium; substance/medication-induced disorders;
and psychotic disorders due to another medical condition.

Traumatic brain injury.

When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g.,
traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma),
symptoms of PTSD may appear. An event causing head trauma may also
constitute a psychological traumatic event, and tramautic brain injury
(TBI)--related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive and
may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously termed *postconcussive*
(e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound,
irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and
non-brain-injured populations, including individuals with PTSD. Because
symptoms of PTSD and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a
differential diagnosis between PTSD and neurocognitive disorder symptoms
attributable to TBI may be possible based on the presence of symptoms
that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexperiencing and
avoidance are characteristic of PTSD and not the effects of TBI,
persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI
(neurocognitive effects) than to PTSD.

Comorbidity

Individuals with PTSD are 80% more likely than those without PTSD to
have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for at least one other
mental disorder (e.g., depressive, bipolar, anxiety, or substance use
disorders). Comorbid substance use disorder and conduct disorder are
more common among males than among females. Among U.S. military
personnel and combat veterans who have been deployed to recent wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, co-occurrence of PTSD and mild TBI is 48%.
Although most young children with PTSD also have at least one other
diagnosis, the patterns of comorbidity are different than in adults,
with oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety disorder
predominating. Finally, there is considerable comorbidity between PTSD
and major neurocognitive disorder and some overlapping symptoms between
these disorders.

Acute Stress Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**308.3 (F43.0)**

A. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual
violation in one (or more) of the following ways:

1\. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).

2\. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others.

3\. Learning that the event(s) occurred to a close family member or
close friend. **Note:** In cases of actual or threatened death of a
family member or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or
accidental.

4\. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the
traumatic event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains,
police officers repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse).

**Note:** This does not apply to exposure through electronic media,
television, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related.

B. Presence of nine (or more) of the following symptoms from any of the
five categories of intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance,
and arousal, beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s)
occurred:

**Intrusion Symptoms**

1\. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the
traumatic event(s). **Note:** In children, repetitive play may occur in
which themes or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p326}Acute Stress Disorder

**281**

2\. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of
the dream are related to the event(s). **Note:** In children, there may
be frightening dreams without recognizable content.

3\. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual
feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such
reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression
being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.) **Note:**
In children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play.

4\. Intense or prolonged psychological distress or marked physiological
reactions in response to internal or external cues that symbolize or
resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).

**Negative Mood**

5\. Persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g.,
inability to experience happiness, satisfaction, or loving feelings).

**Dissociative Symptoms**

6\. An altered sense of the reality of one's surroundings or oneself
(e.g., seeing oneself from another's perspective, being in a daze, time
slowing).

7\. Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s)
(typically due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as
head injury, alcohol, or drugs).

**Avoidance Symptoms**

8\. Efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about
or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).

9\. Efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations,
activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories,
thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic
event(s).

**Arousal Symptoms**

10\. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep,
restless sleep).

11\. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no
provocation), typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression
toward people or objects.

12\. Hypervigilance.

13\. Problems with concentration.

14\. Exaggerated startle response.

C. Duration of the disturbance (symptoms in Criterion B) is 3 days to 1
month after trauma exposure.

**Note:** Symptoms typically begin immediately after the trauma, but
persistence for at least 3 days and up to a month is needed to meet
disorder criteria.

D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., medication or alcohol) or another medical condition
(e.g., mild traumatic brain injury) and is not better explained by brief
psychotic disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of acute stress disorder is the development of
characteristic symptoms lasting from 3 days to 1 month following
exposure to one or more traumatic events.

Traumatic events that are experienced directly include, but are not
limited to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or
actual violent personal assault (e.g., sexual

[]{#index_split_028.html#p327}**282**

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

violence, physical attack, active combat, mugging, childhood physical
and/or sexual violence, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist
attack, torture), natural or human-made disasters (e.g., earthquake,
hurricane, airplane crash), and severe accident (e.g., severe motor
vehicle, industrial accident). For children, sexually traumatic events
may include inappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury.
A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not
necessarily considered a traumatic event.

Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden,
catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock).
Stressful events that do not possess the severe and traumatic components
of events encompassed by Criterion A may lead to an adjustment disorder
but not to acute stress disorder.

The clinical presentation of acute stress disorder may vary by
individual but typically involves an anxiety response that includes some
form of reexperiencing of or reactivity to the traumatic event. In some
individuals, a dissociative or detached presentation can predominate,
although these individuals typically will also display strong emotional
or physiological reactivity in response to trauma reminders. In other
individuals, there can be a strong anger response in which reactivity is
characterized by irritable or possibly aggressive responses. The full
symptom picture must be present for at least 3 days after the traumatic
event and can be diagnosed only up to 1 month after the event. Symptoms
that occur immediately after the event but resolve in less than 3 days
would not meet criteria for acute stress disorder.

Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened
or serious injury, unnatural death, physical or sexual violence
inflicted on another individual as a result of violent assault, severe
domestic violence, severe accident, war, and disaster; it may also
include witnessing a medical catastrophe (e.g., a life-threatening
hemorrhage) involving one's child. Events experienced indirectly through
learning about the event are limited to close relatives or close
friends. Such events must have been violent or accidental---death due to
natural causes does not qualify---and include violent personal assault,
suicide, serious accident, or serious injury. The disorder may be
especially severe when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional
(e.g., torture, rape). The likelihood of developing this disorder may
increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor
increase.

The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the
individual has recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event
(Criterion B1). The recollections are spontaneous or triggered recurrent
memories of the event that usually occur in response to a stimulus that
is reminiscent of the traumatic experience (e.g., the sound of a
backfiring car triggering memories of gunshots). These intrusive
memories often include sensory (e.g., sensing the intense heat that was
perceived in a house fire), emotional (e.g., experiencing the fear of
believing that one was about to be stabbed), or physiological (e.g.,
experiencing the shortness of breath that one suffered during a
near-drowning) components.

Distressing dreams may contain themes that are representative of or
thematically related to the major threats involved in the traumatic
event. (For example, in the case of a motor vehicle accident survivor,
the distressing dreams may involve crashing cars generally; in the case
of a combat soldier, the distressing dreams may involve being harmed in
ways other than combat.)

Dissociative states may last from a few seconds to several hours, or
even days, during which components of the event are relived and the
individual behaves as though experiencing the event at that moment.
While dissociative responses are common during a traumatic event, only
dissociative responses that persist beyond 3 days after trauma exposure
are considered for the diagnosis of acute stress disorder. For young
children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play and
may include dissociative moments (e.g., a child who survives a motor
vehicle accident may repeatedly crash toy cars during play in a focused
and distressing manner). These episodes, often referred to as
*flashbacks,* are typically brief but involve a sense that the traumatic
event is occurring in the present rather than being remembered in the
past and are associated with significant distress.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p328}Acute Stress Disorder

**283**

Some individuals with the disorder do not have intrusive memories of the
event itself, but instead experience intense psychological distress or
physiological reactivity when they are exposed to triggering events that
resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days
for children after a hurricane, entering an elevator for a male or
female who was raped in an elevator, seeing someone who resembles one's
perpetrator).

The triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g., a sense of heat
for a burn victim, dizziness for survivors of head trauma), particularly
for individuals with highly somatic presentations. The individual may
have a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (e.g., happiness,
joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, or
sexuality) but can experience negative emotions such as fear, sadness,
anger, guilt, or shame.

Alterations in awareness can include *depersonalization,* a detached
sense of oneself (e.g., seeing oneself from the other side of the room),
or *derealization,* having a distorted view of one's surroundings (e.g.,
perceiving that things are moving in slow motion, seeing things in a
daze, not being aware of events that one would normally encode). Some
individuals also report an inability to remember an important aspect of
the traumatic event that was presumably encoded. This symptom is
attributable to dissociative amnesia and is not attributable to head
injury, alcohol, or drugs.

Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The
individual may refuse to discuss the traumatic experience or may engage
in avoidance strategies to minimize awareness of emotional reactions
(e.g., excessive alcohol use when reminded of the experience). This
behavioral avoidance may include avoiding watching news coverage of the
traumatic experience, refusing to return to a workplace where the trauma
occurred, or avoiding interacting with others who shared the same
traumatic experience.

It is very common for individuals with acute stress disorder to
experience problems with sleep onset and maintenance, which may be
associated with nightmares or with generalized elevated arousal that
prevents adequate sleep. Individuals with acute stress disorder may be
quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical
behavior with little provocation. Acute stress disorder is often
characterized by a heightened sensitivity to potential threats,
including those that are related to the traumatic experience (e.g., a
motor vehicle accident victim may be especially sensitive to the threat
potentially caused by any cars or trucks) or those not related to the
traumatic event (e.g., fear of having a heart attack). Concentration
difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e.g.,
forgetting one's telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g.,
following a conversation for a sustained period of time), are commonly
reported. Individuals with acute stress disorder may be very reactive to
unexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response or
jumpiness to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g., the individual
may jump markedly in the response to a telephone ringing).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with acute stress disorder commonly engage in catastrophic
or extremely negative thoughts about their role in the traumatic event,
their response to the traumatic experience, or the likelihood of future
harm. For example, an individual with acute stress disorder may feel
excessively guilty about not having prevented the traumatic event or
about not adapting to the experience more successfully. Individuals with
acute stress disorder may also interpret their symptoms in a
catastrophic manner, such that flashback memories or emotional numbing
may be interpreted as a sign of diminished mental capacity. It is common
for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience panic attacks
in the initial month after trauma exposure that may be triggered by
trauma reminders or may apparently occur spontaneously. Additionally,
individuals with acute stress disorder may display chaotic or impulsive
behavior. For example, individuals may drive recklessly, make irrational
decisions, or gamble excessively. In children, there may be significant
separation anxiety, possibly manifested by excessive needs for attention
from []{#index_split_028.html#p329}**284**

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

caregivers. In the case of bereavement following a death that occurred
in traumatic circumstances, the symptoms of acute stress disorder can
involve acute grief reactions. In such cases, reexperiencing,
dissociative, and arousal symptoms may involve reactions to the loss,
such as intrusive memories of the circumstances of the individual's
death, disbelief that the individual has died, and anger about the
death. Postconcussive symptoms (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity
to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits), which occur
frequently following mild traumatic brain injury, are also frequently
seen in individuals with acute stress disorder. Postconcussive symptoms
are equally common in brain-injured and non--brain-injured populations,
and the frequent occurrence of postconcussive symptoms could be
attributable to acute stress disorder symptoms.

Prevalence

The prevalence of acute stress disorder in recently trauma-exposed
populations (i.e., within 1 month of trauma exposure) varies according
to the nature of the event and the context in which it is assessed. In
both U.S. and non-U.S. populations, acute stress disorder tends to be
identified in less than 20% of cases following traumatic events that do
not involve interpersonal assault; 13%--21% of motor vehicle accidents,
14% of mild traumatic brain injury, 19% of assault, 10% of severe burns,
and 6%--12% of industrial accidents.

Higher rates (i.e., 20%--50%) are reported following interpersonal
traumatic events, including assault, rape, and witnessing a mass
shooting.

Development and Course

Acute stress disorder cannot be diagnosed until 3 days after a traumatic
event. Although acute stress disorder may progress to posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) after 1 month, it may also be a transient stress
response that remits within 1 month of trauma exposure and does not
result in PTSD. Approximately half of individuals who eventually develop
PTSD initially present with acute stress disorder. Symptom worsening
during the initial month can occur, often as a result of ongoing life
stressors or further traumatic events.

The forms of reexperiencing can vary across development. Unlike adults
or adolescents, young children may report frightening dreams without
content that clearly reflects aspects of the trauma (e.g., waking in
fright in the aftermath of the trauma but being unable to relate the
content of the dream to the traumatic event). Children age 6 years and
younger are more likely than older children to express reexperiencing
symptoms through play that refers directly or symbolically to the
trauma. For example, a very young child who survived a fire may draw
pictures of flames. Young children also do not necessarily manifest
fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or even during
reexperiencing. Parents typically report a range of emotional
expressions, such as anger, shame, or withdrawal, and even excessively
bright positive affect, in young children who are traumatized. Although
children may avoid reminders of the trauma, they sometimes become
preoccupied with reminders (e.g., a young child bitten by a dog may talk
about dogs constantly yet avoid going outside because of fear of coming
into contact with a dog).

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Risk factors include prior mental disorder, high levels of negative
affectivity (neuroticism), greater perceived severity of the traumatic
event, and an avoidant coping style. Catastrophic appraisals of the
traumatic experience, often characterized by exaggerated appraisals of
future harm, guilt, or hopelessness, are strongly predictive of acute
stress disorder.

Environmental.

First and foremost, an individual must be exposed to a traumatic event
to be at risk for acute stress disorder. Risk factors for the disorder
include a history of prior trauma.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p330}Acute Stress Disorder

**285**

Genetic and physiological.

Females are at greater risk for developing acute stress disorder.

Elevated reactivity, as reflected by acoustic startle response, prior to
trauma exposure increases the risk for developing acute stress disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The profile of symptoms of acute stress disorder may vary
cross-culturally, particularly with respect to dissociative symptoms,
nightmares, avoidance, and somatic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, shortness
of breath, heat sensations). Cultural syndromes and idioms of distress
shape the local symptom profiles of acute stress disorder. Some cultural
groups may display variants of dissociative responses, such as
possession or trancelike behaviors in the initial month after trauma
exposure. Panic symptoms may be salient in acute stress disorder among
Cambodians because of the association of traumatic exposure with
panic-like *khyâl* attacks, and *ataque de nervios* among Latin
Americans may also follow a traumatic exposure.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Acute stress disorder is more prevalent among females than among males.
Sex-linked neurobiological differences in stress response may contribute
to females' increased risk for acute stress disorder. The increased risk
for the disorder in females may be attributable in part to a greater
likelihood of exposure to the types of traumatic events with a high
conditional risk for acute stress disorder, such as rape and other
interpersonal violence.

Functional Consequences of Acute Stress Disorder

Impaired functioning in social, interpersonal, or occupational domains
has been shown across survivors of accidents, assault, and rape who
develop acute stress disorder. The extreme levels of anxiety that may be
associated with acute stress disorder may interfere with sleep, energy
levels, and capacity to attend to tasks. Avoidance in acute stress
disorder can result in generalized withdrawal from many situations that
are perceived as potentially threatening, which can lead to
nonattendance of medical appointments, avoidance of driving to important
appointments, and absenteeism from work.

Differential Diagnosis

Adjustment disorders.

In acute stress disorder, the stressor can be of any severity rather
than of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress
disorder. The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is used when the
response to a Criterion A event does not meet the criteria for acute
stress disorder (or another specific mental disorder) and when the
symptom pattern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a
stressor that does not meet Criterion A for exposure to actual or
threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (e.g., spouse
leaving, being fired). For example, severe stress reactions to
life-threatening illnesses that may include some acute stress disorder
symptoms may be more appropriately described as an adjustment disorder.
Some forms of acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder
symptoms and may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These
responses are more appropriately described as primarily an adjustment
disorder. Depressive or anger responses in an adjustment disorder may
involve rumination about the traumatic event, as opposed to involuntary
and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder.

Panic disorder.

Spontaneous panic attacks are very common in acute stress disorder.

However, panic disorder is diagnosed only if panic attacks are
unexpected and there is anxiety about future attacks or maladaptive
changes in behavior associated with fear of dire consequences of the
attacks.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p331}**286**

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

Dissociative disorders.

Severe dissociative responses (in the absence of characteristic acute
stress disorder symptoms) may be diagnosed as
derealization/depersonalization disorder. If severe amnesia of the
trauma persists in the absence of characteristic acute stress disorder
symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be indicated.

Posttraumatic stress disorder.

Acute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the symptom
pattern in acute stress disorder must occur within 1 month of the
traumatic event and resolve within that 1-month period. If the symptoms
persist for more than 1 month and meet criteria for PTSD, the diagnosis
is changed from acute stress disorder to PTSD.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

In obsessive-compulsive disorder, there are recurrent intrusive
thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition,
the intrusive thoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic
event, compulsions are usually present, and other symptoms of acute
stress disorder are typically absent.

Psychotic disorders.

Flashbacks in acute stress disorder must be distinguished from
illusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may
occur in schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, depressive or bipolar
disorder with psychotic features, a delirium,
substance/medication-induced disorders, and psychotic disorders due to
another medical condition. Acute stress disorder flashbacks are
distinguished from these other perceptual disturbances by being directly
related to the traumatic experience and by occurring in the absence of
other psychotic or substance-induced features.

Traumatic brain injury.

When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g.,
traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma),
symptoms of acute stress disorder may appear. An event causing head
trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event, and
tramautic brain injury (TBI)--related neurocognitive symptoms are not
mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously
termed *postconcussive* (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to
light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in
brain-injured and non--brain injured populations, including individuals
with acute stress disorder. Because symptoms of acute stress disorder
and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential
diagnosis between acute stress disorder and neurocognitive disorder
symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible based on the presence of
symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas
reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acute stress disorder
and not the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are
more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to acute stress
disorder. Furthermore, differential is aided by the fact that symptoms
of acute stress disorder persist for up to only 1 month following trauma
exposure.

Adjustment Disorders

Diagnostic Criteria

A. The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an
identifiable stressor(s) occurring within 3 months of the onset of the
stressor(s).

B. These symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced
by one or both of the following:

1\. Marked distress that is out of proportion to the severity or
intensity of the stressor, taking into account the external context and
the cultural factors that might influence symptom severity and
presentation.

2\. Significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning.

C. The stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another
mental disorder and is not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting
mental disorder.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p332}Adjustment Disorders

**287**

D. The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement.

E. Once the stressor or its consequences have terminated, the symptoms
do not persist for more than an additional 6 months.

*Specify* whether:

**309.0 (F43.21) With depressed mood:** Low mood, tearfulness, or
feelings of hopelessness are predominant.

**309.24 (F43.22) With anxiety:** Nervousness, worry, jitteriness, or
separation anxiety is predominant.

**309.28 (F43.23) With mixed anxiety and depressed mood:** A combination
of depression and anxiety is predominant.

**309.3 (F43.24) With disturbance of conduct:** Disturbance of conduct
is predominant.

**309.4 (F43.25) With mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct:** Both
emotional symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and a disturbance of
conduct are predominant.

**309.9 (F43.20) Unspecified:** For maladaptive reactions that are not
classifiable as one of the specific subtypes of adjustment disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The presence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an
identifiable stressor is the essential feature of adjustment disorders
(Criterion A). The stressor may be a single event (e.g., a termination
of a romantic relationship), or there may be multiple stressors (e.g.,
marked business difficulties and marital problems). Stressors may be
recurrent (e.g., associated with seasonal business crises, unfulfilling
sexual relationships) or continuous (e.g., a persistent painful illness
with increasing disability, living in a crime-ridden neighborhood).
Stressors may affect a single individual, an entire family, or a larger
group or community (e.g., a natural disaster). Some stressors may
accompany specific developmental events (e.g., going to school, leaving
a parental home, reentering a parental home, getting married, becoming a
parent, failing to attain occupational goals, retirement).

Adjustment disorders may be diagnosed following the death of a loved one
when the intensity, quality, or persistence of grief reactions exceeds
what normally might be expected, when cultural, religious, or
age-appropriate norms are taken into account. A more specific set of
bereavement-related symptoms has been designated *persistent complex
bereavement disorder.*

Adjustment disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicide
attempts and completed suicide.

Prevalence

Adjustment disorders are common, although prevalence may vary widely as
a function of the population studied and the assessment methods used.
The percentage of individuals in outpatient mental health treatment with
a principal diagnosis of an adjustment disorder ranges from
approximately 5% to 20%. In a hospital psychiatric consultation setting,
it is often the most common diagnosis, frequently reaching 50%.

Development and Course

By definition, the disturbance in adjustment disorders begins within 3
months of onset of a stressor and lasts no longer than 6 months after
the stressor or its consequences have ceased. If the stressor is an
acute event (e.g., being fired from a job), the onset of the disturbance
is usually immediate (i.e., within a few days) and the duration is
relatively brief (i.e., no more than a few months). If the stressor or
its consequences persist, the adjustment disorder may also continue to
be present and become the persistent form.

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Individuals from disadvantaged life circumstances experience a high rate
of stressors and may be at increased risk for adjustment disorders.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The context of the individual's cultural setting should be taken into
account in making the clinical judgment of whether the individual's
response to the stressor is maladaptive or whether the associated
distress is in excess of what would be expected. The nature, meaning,
and experience of the stressors and the evaluation of the response to
the stressors may vary across cultures.

Functional Consequences of Adjustment Disorders

The subjective distress or impairment in functioning associated with
adjustment disorders is frequently manifested as decreased performance
at work or school and temporary changes in social relationships. An
adjustment disorder may complicate the course of illness in individuals
who have a general medical condition (e.g., decreased compliance with
the recommended medical regimen; increased length of hospital stay).

Differential Diagnosis

Major depressive disorder.

If an individual has symptoms that meet criteria for a major depressive
disorder in response to a stressor, the diagnosis of an adjustment
disorder is not applicable. The symptom profile of major depressive
disorder differentiates it from adjustment disorders.

Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder.

In adjustment disorders, the

stressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type
required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). In distinguishing adjustment disorders from
these two posttraumatic diagnoses, there are both timing and symptom
profile considerations. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed
immediately and persist up to 6 months after exposure to the traumatic
event, whereas acute stress disorder can only occur between 3 days and 1
month of exposure to the stressor, and PTSD

cannot be diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the
occurrence of the traumatic stressor. The required symptom profile for
PTSD and acute stress disorder differentiates them from the adjustment
disorders. With regard to symptom profiles, an adjustment disorder may
be diagnosed following a traumatic event when an individual exhibits
symptoms of either acute stress disorder or PTSD that do not meet or
exceed the diagnostic threshold for either disorder. An adjustment
disorder should also be diagnosed for individuals who have not been
exposed to a traumatic event but who otherwise exhibit the full symptom
profile of either acute stress disorder or PTSD.

Personality disorders.

With regard to personality disorders, some personality features may be
associated with a vulnerability to situational distress that may
resemble an adjustment disorder. The lifetime history of personality
functioning will help inform the interpretation of distressed behaviors
to aid in distinguishing a long-standing personality disorder from an
adjustment disorder. In addition to some personality disorders incurring
vulnerability to distress, stressors may also exacerbate personality
disorder symptoms. In the presence of a personality disorder, if the
symptom criteria for an adjustment disorder are met, and the
stress-related disturbance exceeds what may be attributable to
maladaptive personality disorder symptoms (i.e., Criterion C is met),
then the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder should be made.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p334}Other Specified Trauma-and
Stressor-Related Disorder **289**

Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions.

In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, specific
psychological entities (e.g., psychological symptoms, behaviors, other
factors) exacerbate a medical condition. These psychological factors can
precipitate, exacerbate, or put an individual at risk for medical
illness, or they can worsen an existing condition. In contrast, an
adjustment disorder is a reaction to the stressor (e.g., having a
medical illness).

Normative stress reactions.

When bad things happen, most people get upset. This is not an adjustment
disorder. The diagnosis should only be made when the magnitude of the
distress (e.g., alterations in mood, anxiety, or conduct) exceeds what
would normally be expected (which may vary in different cultures) or
when the adverse event precipitates functional impairment.

Comorbidity

Adjustment disorders can accompany most mental disorders and any medical
disorder.

Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed in addition to another mental
disorder only if the latter does not explain the particular symptoms
that occur in reaction to the stressor. For example, an individual may
develop an adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, after losing a job
and at the same time have a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Or, an individual may have a depressive or bipolar disorder and an
adjustment disorder as long as the criteria for both are met. Adjustment
disorders are common accompaniments of medical illness and may be the
major psychological response to a medical disorder.

Other Specified Trauma-and

Stressor-Related Disorder

**309.89 (F43.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a trauma-and stressor-related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the trauma-and stressor-related
disorders diagnostic class. The other specified trauma-and
stressor-related disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific trauma-and
stressor-related disorder. This is done by recording "other specified
trauma-and stressor-related disorder" followed by the specific reason
(e.g., "persistent complex bereavement disorder").

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following:

1\. **Adjustment-like disorders with delayed onset of symptoms that
occur more than** **3 months after the stressor.**

2\. **Adjustment-like disorders with prolonged duration of more than 6
months without prolonged duration of stressor.**

3\. ***Ataque de nervios:*** See "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of
Distress" in the Appendix.

4\. **Other cultural syndromes:** See "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of
Distress" in the Appendix.

5\. **Persistent complex bereavement disorder:** This disorder is
characterized by severe and persistent grief and mourning reactions (see
the chapter "Conditions for Further Study").

Unspecified Trauma-and

Stressor-Related Disorder

**309.9 (F43.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a trauma-and stressor-related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the trauma-and stressor-related
disorders diagnostic class.

The unspecified trauma-or stressor-related disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason
that the criteria are not met for a specific trauma-and stressor-related
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room
settings).

[]{#index_split_028.html#p336}**Dissociative**

**Disorders**

Dissociative disorders are characterized by a disruption of and/or
discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory,
identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and
behavior. Dissociative symptoms can potentially disrupt every area of
psychological functioning. This chapter includes dissociative identity
disorder, dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/derealization
disorder, other specified dissociative disorder, and unspecified
dissociative disorder.

Dissociative symptoms are experienced as a) unbidden intrusions into
awareness and behavior, with accompanying losses of continuity in
subjective experience (i.e., ''positive''

dissociative symptoms such as fragmentation of identity,
depersonalization, and derealization) and/or b) inability to access
information or to control mental functions that normally are readily
amenable to access or control (i.e., "negative'' dissociative symptoms
such as amnesia).

The dissociative disorders are frequently found in the aftermath of
trauma, and many of the symptoms, including embarrassment and confusion
about the symptoms or a desire to hide them, are influenced by the
proximity to trauma. In DSM-5, the dissociative disorders are placed
next to, but are not part of, the trauma-and stressor-related disorders,
reflecting the close relationship between these diagnostic classes. Both
acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder contain
dissociative symptoms, such as amnesia, flashbacks, numbing, and
depersonalization/derealization.

*Depersonalization/derealization disorder* is characterized by
clinically significant persistent or recurrent depersonalization (i.e.,
experiences of unreality or detachment from one's mind, self, or body)
and/or derealization (i.e., experiences of unreality or detachment from
one's surroundings). These alterations of experience are accompanied by
intact reality testing. There is no evidence of any distinction between
individuals with predominantly depersonalization versus derealization
symptoms. Therefore, individuals with this disorder can have
depersonalization, derealization, or both.

*Dissociative amnesia* is characterized by an inability to recall
autobiographical information. This amnesia may be localized (i.e., an
event or period of time), selective (i.e., a specific aspect of an
event), or generalized (i.e., identity and life history). Dissociative
amnesia is fundamentally an inability to recall autobiographical
information that is inconsistent with normal forgetting. It may or may
not involve purposeful travel or bewildered wandering (i.e., fugue).
Although some individuals with amnesia promptly notice that they have
"lost time"

or that they have a gap in their memory, most individuals with
dissociative disorders are initially unaware of their amnesias. For
them, awareness of amnesia occurs only when personal identity is lost or
when circumstances make these individuals aware that autobiographical
information is missing (e.g., when they discover evidence of events they
cannot recall or when others tell them or ask them about events they
cannot recall). Until and unless this happens, these individuals have
"amnesia for their amnesia." Amnesia is experienced as an essential
feature of dissociative amnesia; individuals may experience localized or
selective amnesia most commonly, or generalized amnesia rarely.
Dissociative fugue is rare in persons with dissociative amnesia but
common in dissociative identity disorder.

Dissociative identity disorder is characterized by a) the presence of
two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession
and b) recurrent episodes of amnesia. The **291**

[]{#index_split_028.html#p337}**292**

Dissociative Disorders

fragmentation of identity may vary with culture (e.g., possession-form
presentations) and circumstance. Thus, individuals may experience
discontinuities in identity and memory that may not be immediately
evident to others or are obscured by attempts to hide dysfunction.
Individuals with dissociative identity disorder experience a) recurrent,
inexplicable intrusions into their conscious functioning and sense of
self (e.g., voices; dissociated actions and speech; intrusive thoughts,
emotions, and impulses), b) alterations of sense of self (e.g.,
attitudes, preferences, and feeling like one's body or actions are not
one's own), c) odd changes of perception (e.g., depersonalization or
derealization, such as feeling detached from one's body while cutting),
and d) intermittent functional neurological symptoms. Stress often
produces transient exacerbation of dissociative symptoms that makes them
more evident.

The residual category of other specified dissociative disorder has seven
examples: chronic or recurrent mixed dissociative symptoms that
approach, but fall short of, the diagnostic criteria for dissociative
identity disorder; dissociative states secondary to brainwashing or
thought reform; two acute presentations, of less than 1 month's
duration, of mixed dissociative symptoms, one of which is also marked by
the presence of psychotic symptoms; and three single-symptom
dissociative presentations---dissociative trance, dissociative stupor or
coma, and Ganser's syndrome (the giving of approximate and vague
answers).

Dissociative Identity Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.14 (F44.81)**

A. Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct
personality states, which may be described in some cultures as an
experience of possession. The disruption in identity involves marked
discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, accompanied by
related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory,
perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and
symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.

B. Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal
information, and/

or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.

C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

D. The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural
or religious practice.

**Note:** In children, the symptoms are not better explained by
imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.

E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol
intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial
seizures).

Diagnostic Features

The defining feature of dissociative identity disorder is the presence
of two or more distinct personality states or an experience of
possession (Criterion A). The overtness or covertness of these
personality states, however, varies as a function of psychological
motivation, current level of stress, culture, internal conflicts and
dynamics, and emotional resilience. Sustained periods of identity
disruption may occur when psychosocial pressures are severe and/or
prolonged. In many possession-form cases of dissociative identity
disorder, and in a small proportion of non-possession-form cases,
manifestations of alternate identities are highly overt. Most
individuals with non-possession-form dissociative identity disorder do
not overtly display their discontinuity of identity for long periods of
time; only a small minority present to clinical attention with
observable alternation of []{#index_split_028.html#p338}Dissociative
Identity Disorder

**293**

identities. When alternate personality states are not directly observed,
the disorder can be identified by two clusters of symptoms: 1) sudden
alterations or discontinuities in sense of self and sense of agency
(Criterion A), and 2) recurrent dissociative amnesias (Criterion B).

Criterion A symptoms are related to discontinuities of experience that
can affect any aspect of an individual's functioning. Individuals with
dissociative identity disorder may report the feeling that they have
suddenly become depersonalized observers of their

"own" speech and actions, which they may feel powerless to stop (sense
of self). Such individuals may also report perceptions of voices (e.g.,
a child's voice; crying; the voice of a spiritual being). In some cases,
voices are experienced as multiple, perplexing, independent thought
streams over which the individual experiences no control. Strong
emotions, impulses, and even speech or other actions may suddenly
emerge, without a sense of personal ownership or control (sense of
agency). These emotions and impulses are frequently reported as
ego-dystonic and puzzling. Attitudes, outlooks, and personal preferences
(e.g., about food, activities, dress) may suddenly shift and then shift
back. Individuals may report that their bodies feel different (e.g.,
like a small child, like the opposite gender, huge and muscular).
Alterations in sense of self and loss of personal agency may be
accompanied by a feeling that these attitudes, emotions, and
behaviors---even one's body---are "not mine" and/or are "not under my
control." Although most Criterion A symptoms are subjective, many of
these sudden discontinuities in speech, affect, and behavior can be
witnessed by family, friends, or the clinician. Non-epileptic seizures
and other conversion symptoms are prominent in some presentations of
dissociative identity disorder, especially in some non-Western settings.

The dissociative amnesia of individuals with dissociative identity
disorder manifests in three primary ways: as 1) gaps in remote memory of
personal life events (e.g., periods of childhood or adolescence; some
important life events, such as the death of a grandparent, getting
married, giving birth); 2) lapses in dependable memory (e.g., of what
happened today, of well-learned skills such as how to do their job, use
a computer, read, drive); and 3) discovery of evidence of their everyday
actions and tasks that they do not recollect doing (e.g., finding
unexplained objects in their shopping bags or among their possessions;
finding perplexing writings or drawings that they must have created;
discovering injuries; "coming to" in the midst of doing something).
Dissociative fugues, wherein the person discovers dissociated travel,
are common. Thus, individuals with dissociative identity disorder may
report that they have suddenly found themselves at the beach, at work,
in a night-club, or somewhere at home (e.g., in the closet, on a bed or
sofa, in the corner) with no memory of how they came to be there.
Amnesia in individuals with dissociative identity disorder is not
limited to stressful or traumatic events; these individuals often cannot
recall everyday events as well.

Individuals with dissociative identity disorder vary in their awareness
and attitude toward their amnesias. It is common for these individuals
to minimize their amnestic symptoms. Some of their amnestic behaviors
may be apparent to others---as when these persons do not recall
something they were witnessed to have done or said, when they cannot
remember their own name, or when they do not recognize their spouse,
children, or close friends.

Possession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder typically
manifest as behaviors that appear as if a "spirit," supernatural being,
or outside person has taken control, such that the individual begins
speaking or acting in a distinctly different manner. For example, an
individual's behavior may give the appearance that her identity has been
replaced by the "ghost" of a girl who committed suicide in the same
community years before, speaking and acting as though she were still
alive. Or an individual may be "taken over" by a demon or deity,
resulting in profound impairment, and demanding that the individual or a
relative be punished for a past act, followed by more subtle periods of
identity alteration. However, the majority of possession states around
the world are normal, usually part of spiritual practice, and do not
meet criteria for dissociative identity disor-

[]{#index_split_028.html#p339}**294**

Dissociative Disorders

der. The identities that arise during possession-form dissociative
identity disorder present recurrently, are unwanted and involuntary,
cause clinically significant distress or impairment (Criterion C), and
are not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious
practice (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with dissociative identity disorder typically present with
comorbid depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury,
non-epileptic seizures, or another common symptom. They often conceal,
or are not fully aware of, disruptions in consciousness, amnesia, or
other dissociative symptoms. Many individuals with dissociative identity
disorder report dissociative flashbacks during which they undergo a
sensory reliving of a previous event as though it were occurring in the
present, often with a change of identity, a partial or complete loss of
contact with or disorientation to current reality during the flashback,
and a subsequent amnesia for the content of the flashback. Individuals
with the disorder typically report multiple types of interpersonal
maltreatment during childhood and adulthood. Nonmaltreatment forms of
overwhelming early life events, such as multiple long, painful,
early-life medical procedures, also may be reported. Self-mutilation and
suicidal behavior are frequent. On standardized measures, these
individuals report higher levels of hypnotizability and dissociativity
compared with other clinical groups and healthy control subjects. Some
individuals experience transient psychotic phenomena or episodes.

Several brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of
dissociative identity disorder, including the orbitofrontal cortex,
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala.

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalence of dissociative identity disorder among adults
in a small U.S.

community study was 1.5%. The prevalence across genders in that study
was 1.6% for males and 1.4% for females.

Development and Course

Dissociative identity disorder is associated with overwhelming
experiences, traumatic events, and/or abuse occurring in childhood. The
full disorder may first manifest at almost any age (from earliest
childhood to late life). Dissociation in children may generate problems
with memory, concentration, attachment, and traumatic play.
Nevertheless, children usually do not present with identity changes;
instead they present primarily with overlap and interference among
mental states (Criterion A phenomena), with symptoms related to
discontinuities of experience. Sudden changes in identity during
adolescence may appear to be just adolescent turmoil or the early stages
of another mental disorder. Older individuals may present to treatment
with what appear to be late-life mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, paranoia, psychotic mood disorders, or even cognitive
disorders due to dissociative amnesia. In some cases, disruptive affects
and memories may increasingly intrude into awareness with advancing age.

Psychological decompensation and overt changes in identity may be
triggered by 1) removal from the traumatizing situation (e.g., through
leaving home); 2) the individual's children reaching the same age at
which the individual was originally abused or traumatized; 3) later
traumatic experiences, even seemingly inconsequential ones, like a minor
motor vehicle accident; or 4) the death of, or the onset of a fatal
illness in, their abuser(s).

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Interpersonal physical and sexual abuse is associated with an increased
risk of dissociative identity disorder. Prevalence of childhood abuse
and neglect in the

[]{#index_split_028.html#p340}Dissociative Identity Disorder

**295**

United States, Canada, and Europe among those with the disorder is about
90%. Other forms of traumatizing experiences, including childhood
medical and surgical procedures, war, childhood prostitution, and
terrorism, have been reported.

Course modifiers.

Ongoing abuse, later-life retraumatization, comorbidity with mental
disorders, severe medical illness, and delay in appropriate treatment
are associated with poorer prognosis.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Many features of dissociative identity disorder can be influenced by the
individual's cultural background. Individuals with this disorder may
present with prominent medically unexplained neurological symptoms, such
as non-epileptic seizures, paralyses, or sensory loss, in cultural
settings where such symptoms are common. Similarly, in settings where
normative possession is common (e.g., rural areas in the developing
world, among certain religious groups in the United States and Europe),
the fragmented identities may take the form of possessing spirits,
deities, demons, animals, or mythical figures. Acculturation or
prolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of the
other identities (e.g., identities in India may speak English
exclusively and wear Western clothes). Possession-form dissociative
identity disorder can be distinguished from culturally accepted
possession states in that the former is involuntary, distressing,
uncontrollable, and often recurrent or persistent; involves conflict
between the individual and his or her surrounding family, social, or
work milieu; and is manifested at times and in places that violate the
norms of the culture or religion.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Females with dissociative identity disorder predominate in adult
clinical settings but not in child clinical settings. Adult males with
dissociative identity disorder may deny their symptoms and trauma
histories, and this can lead to elevated rates of false negative
diagnosis. Females with dissociative identity disorder present more
frequently with acute dissociative states (e.g., flashbacks, amnesia,
fugue, functional neurological \[conversion\]

symptoms, hallucinations, self-mutilation). Males commonly exhibit more
criminal or violent behavior than females; among males, common triggers
of acute dissociative states include combat, prison conditions, and
physical or sexual assaults.

Suicide Risk

Over 70% of outpatients with dissociative identity disorder have
attempted suicide; multiple attempts are common, and other
self-injurious behavior is frequent. Assessment of suicide risk may be
complicated when there is amnesia for past suicidal behavior or when the
presenting identity does not feel suicidal and is unaware that other
dissociated identities do.

Functional Consequences of

Dissociative Identity Disorder

Impairment varies widely, from apparently minimal (e.g., in
high-functioning professionals) to profound. Regardless of level of
disability, individuals with dissociative identity disorder commonly
minimize the impact of their dissociative and posttraumatic symptoms.
The symptoms of higher-functioning individuals may impair their
relational, marital, family, and parenting functions more than their
occupational and professional life (although the latter also may be
affected). With appropriate treatment, many impaired individuals show
marked improvement in occupational and personal functioning. However,
some remain highly impaired in most activities of living. These
individuals may only respond to treatment very slowly, with gradual
reduction in or improved tolerance of
[]{#index_split_028.html#p341}**296**

Dissociative Disorders

their dissociative and posttraumatic symptoms. Long-term supportive
treatment may slowly increase these individuals' ability to manage their
symptoms and decrease use of more restrictive levels of care.

Differential Diagnosis

Other specified dissociative disorder.

The core of dissociative identity disorder is the

division of identity, with recurrent disruption of conscious functioning
and sense of self.

This central feature is shared with one form of other specified
dissociative disorder, which may be distinguished from dissociative
identity disorder by the presence of chronic or recurrent mixed
dissociative symptoms that do not meet Criterion A for dissociative
identity disorder or are not accompanied by recurrent amnesia.

Major depressive disorder.

Individuals with dissociative identity disorder are often depressed, and
their symptoms may appear to meet the criteria for a major depressive
episode.

Rigorous assessment indicates that this depression in some cases does
not meet full criteria for major depressive disorder. Other specified
depressive disorder in individuals with dissociative identity disorder
often has an important feature: the depressed mood and cognitions
*fluctuate* because they are experienced in some identity states but not
others.

Bipolar disorders.

Individuals with dissociative identity disorder are often misdiagnosed
with a bipolar disorder, most often bipolar II disorder. The relatively
rapid shifts in mood in individuals with this disorder---typically
within minutes or hours, in contrast to the slower mood changes
typically seen in individuals with bipolar disorders---are due to the
rapid, subjective shifts in mood commonly reported across dissociative
states, sometimes accompanied by fluctuation in levels of activation.
Furthermore, in dissociative identity disorder, elevated or depressed
mood may be displayed in conjunction with overt identities, so one or
the other mood may predominate for a relatively long period of time
(often for days) or may shift within minutes.

Posttraumatic stress disorder.

Some traumatized individuals have both posttraumatic

stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative identity disorder. Accordingly,
it is crucial to distinguish between individuals with PTSD only and
individuals who have both PTSD and dissociative identity disorder. This
differential diagnosis requires that the clinician establish the
presence or absence of dissociative symptoms that are not characteristic
of acute stress disorder or PTSD. Some individuals with PTSD manifest
dissociative symptoms that also occur in dissociative identity
disorder: 1) amnesia for some aspects of trauma, 2) dissociative
flashbacks (i.e., reliving of the trauma, with reduced awareness of
one's current orientation), and 3) symptoms of intrusion and avoidance,
negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal that are
focused around the traumatic event. On the other hand, individuals with
dissociative identity disorder manifest dissociative symptoms that are
not a manifestation of PTSD: 1) amnesias for many everyday (i.e.,
nontraumatic) events, 2) dissociative flashbacks that may be followed by
amnesia for the content of the flashback, 3) disruptive intrusions
(unrelated to traumatic material) by dissociated identity states into
the individual's sense of self and agency, and 4) infrequent, full-blown
changes among different identity states.

Psychotic disorders.

Dissociative identity disorder may be confused with schizophrenia or
other psychotic disorders. The personified, internally communicative
inner voices of dissociative identity disorder, especially of a child
(e.g., "I hear a little girl crying in a closet and an angry man yelling
at her"), may be mistaken for psychotic hallucinations.

Dissociative experiences of identity fragmentation or possession, and of
perceived loss of control over thoughts, feelings, impulses, and acts,
may be confused with signs of formal thought disorder, such as thought
insertion or withdrawal. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder
may also report visual, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, and somatic
hallucinations, which are usually related to posttraumatic and
dissociative factors, such as partial
[]{#index_split_028.html#p342}Dissociative Identity Disorder

**297**

flashbacks. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder experience
these symptoms as caused by alternate identities, do not have delusional
explanations for the phenomena, and often describe the symptoms in a
personified way (e.g., "I feel like someone else wants to cry with my
eyes"). Persecutory and derogatory internal voices in dissociative
identity disorder associated with depressive symptoms may be
misdiagnosed as major depression with psychotic features. Chaotic
identity change and acute intrusions that disrupt thought processes may
be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder by the predominance of
dissociative symptoms and amnesia for the episode, and diagnostic
evaluation after cessation of the crisis can help confirm the diagnosis.

Substance/medication-induced disorders.

Symptoms associated with the physiological

effects of a substance can be distinguished from dissociative identity
disorder if the substance in question is judged to be etiologically
related to the disturbance.

Personality disorders.

Individuals with dissociative identity disorder often present identities
that appear to encapsulate a variety of severe personality disorder
features, suggesting a differential diagnosis of personality disorder,
especially of the borderline type. Importantly, however, the
individual's longitudinal variability in personality style (due to
inconsistency among identities) differs from the pervasive and
persistent dysfunction in affect management and interpersonal
relationships typical of those with personality disorders.

Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).

This disorder may be

distinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the absence of an
identity disruption characterized by two or more distinct personality
states or an experience of possession.

Dissociative amnesia in conversion disorder is more limited and
circumscribed (e.g., amnesia for a non-epileptic seizure).

Seizure disorders.

Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may present with
seizurelike symptoms and behaviors that resemble complex partial
seizures with temporal lobe foci. These include déjà vu, jamais vu,
depersonalization, derealization, out-of-body experiences, amnesia,
disruptions of consciousness, hallucinations, and other intrusion
phenomena of sensation, affect, and thought. Normal
electroencephalographic findings, including telemetry, differentiate
non-epileptic seizures from the seizurelike symptoms of dissociative
identity disorder. Also, individuals with dissociative identity disorder
obtain very high dissociation scores, whereas individuals with complex
partial seizures do not.

Factitious disorder and malingering.

Individuals who feign dissociative identity disorder do not report the
subtle symptoms of intrusion characteristic of the disorder; instead
they tend to overreport well-publicized symptoms of the disorder, such
as dissociative amnesia, while underreporting less-publicized comorbid
symptoms, such as depression.

Individuals who feign dissociative identity disorder tend to be
relatively undisturbed by or may even seem to enjoy "having" the
disorder. In contrast, individuals with genuine dissociative identity
disorder tend to be ashamed of and overwhelmed by their symptoms and to
underreport their symptoms or deny their condition. Sequential
observation, corroborating history, and intensive psychometric and
psychological assessment may be helpful in assessment.

Individuals who malinger dissociative identity disorder usually create
limited, stereotyped alternate identities, with feigned amnesia, related
to the events for which gain is sought. For example, they may present an
"all-good" identity and an "all-bad" identity in hopes of gaining
exculpation for a crime.

Comorbidity

Many individuals with dissociative identity disorder present with a
comorbid disorder. If not assessed and treated specifically for the
dissociative disorder, these individuals often receive prolonged
treatment for the comorbid diagnosis only, with limited overall
treatment response and resultant demoralization, and disability.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p343}**298**

Dissociative Disorders

Individuals with dissociative identity disorder usually exhibit a large
number of comorbid disorders. In particular, most develop PTSD. Other
disorders that are highly comorbid with dissociative identity disorder
include depressive disorders, trauma-and stressor-related disorders,
personality disorders (especially avoidant and borderline personality
disorders), conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom
disorder), somatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, substance-related
disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and sleep disorders.
Dissociative alterations in identity, memory, and consciousness may
affect the symptom presentation of comorbid disorders.

Dissociative Amnesia

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.12 (F44.0)**

A. An inability to recall important autobiographical information,
usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is inconsistent with
ordinary forgetting.

**Note:** Dissociative amnesia most often consists of localized or
selective amnesia for a specific event or events; or generalized amnesia
for identity and life history.

B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., alcohol or other drug of abuse, a medication) or a
neurological or other medical condition (e.g., partial complex seizures,
transient global amnesia, sequelae of a closed head injury/traumatic
brain injury, other neurological condition).

D. The disturbance is not better explained by dissociative identity
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, somatic
symptom disorder, or major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

**Coding note:** The code for dissociative amnesia without dissociative
fugue is **300.12**

**(F44.0).** The code for dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue
is **300.13 (F44.1).**

*Specify* if:

**300.13 (F44.1) With dissociative fugue:** Apparently purposeful travel
or bewildered wandering that is associated with amnesia for identity or
for other important autobiographical information.

Diagnostic Features

The defining characteristic of dissociative amnesia is an inability to
recall important autobiographical information that 1) should be
successfully stored in memory and 2) ordinarily would be readily
remembered (Criterion A). Dissociative amnesia differs from the
permanent amnesias due to neurobiological damage or toxicity that
prevent memory storage or retrieval in that it is always potentially
reversible because the memory has been successfully stored.

*Localized amnesia,* a failure to recall events during a circumscribed
period of time, is the most common form of dissociative amnesia.
Localized amnesia may be broader than amnesia for a single traumatic
event (e.g., months or years associated with child abuse or intense
combat). In *selective amnesia,* the individual can recall some, but not
all, of the events during a circumscribed period of time. Thus, the
individual may remember part of a traumatic event but not other parts.
Some individuals report both localized and selective amnesias.

*Generalized amnesia,* a complete loss of memory for one's life history,
is rare. Individuals with generalized amnesia may forget personal
identity. Some lose previous knowledge about the world (i.e., semantic
knowledge) and can no longer access well-learned skills

[]{#index_split_028.html#p344}Dissociative Amnesia

**299**

(i.e., procedural knowledge). Generalized amnesia has an acute onset;
the perplexity, disorientation, and purposeless wandering of individuals
with generalized amnesia usually bring them to the attention of the
police or psychiatric emergency services. Generalized amnesia may be
more common among combat veterans, sexual assault victims, and
individuals experiencing extreme emotional stress or conflict.

Individuals with dissociative amnesia are frequently unaware (or only
partially aware) of their memory problems. Many, especially those with
localized amnesia, minimize the importance of their memory loss and may
become uncomfortable when prompted to address it. In *systematized
amnesia,* the individual loses memory for a specific category of
information (e.g., all memories relating to one's family, a particular
person, or childhood sexual abuse). In *continuous amnesia,* an
individual forgets each new event as it occurs.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Many individuals with dissociative amnesia are chronically impaired in
their ability to form and sustain satisfactory relationships. Histories
of trauma, child abuse, and victimization are common. Some individuals
with dissociative amnesia report dissociative flashbacks (i.e.,
behavioral reexperiencing of traumatic events). Many have a history of
self-mutilation, suicide attempts, and other high-risk behaviors.
Depressive and functional neurological symptoms are common, as are
depersonalization, auto-hypnotic symptoms, and high hypnotizability.
Sexual dysfunctions are common. Mild traumatic brain injury may precede
dissociative amnesia.

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalence for dissociative amnesia among adults in a small
U.S. community study was 1.8% (1.0% for males; 2.6% for females).

Development and Course

Onset of generalized amnesia is usually sudden. Less is known about the
onset of localized and selective amnesias because these amnesias are
seldom evident, even to the individual.

Although overwhelming or intolerable events typically precede localized
amnesia, its onset may be delayed for hours, days, or longer.

Individuals may report multiple episodes of dissociative amnesia. A
single episode may predispose to future episodes. In between episodes of
amnesia, the individual may or may not appear to be acutely symptomatic.
The duration of the forgotten events can range from minutes to decades.
Some episodes of dissociative amnesia resolve rapidly (e.g., when the
person is removed from combat or some other stressful situation),
whereas other episodes persist for long periods of time. Some
individuals may gradually recall the dissociated memories years later.
Dissociative capacities may decline with age, but not always. As the
amnesia remits, there may be considerable distress, suicidal behavior,
and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Dissociative amnesia has been observed in young children, adolescents,
and adults.

Children may be the most difficult to evaluate because they often have
difficulty understanding questions about amnesia, and interviewers may
find it difficult to formulate child-friendly questions about memory and
amnesia. Observations of apparent dissociative amnesia are often
difficult to differentiate from inattention, absorption, anxiety,
oppositional behavior, and learning disorders. Reports from several
different sources (e.g., teacher, therapist, case worker) may be needed
to diagnose amnesia in children.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Single or repeated traumatic experiences (e.g., war, childhood
maltreatment, natural disaster, internment in concentration camps,
genocide) are common ante-

[]{#index_split_028.html#p345}**300**

Dissociative Disorders

cedents. Dissociative amnesia is more likely to occur with 1) a greater
number of adverse childhood experiences, particularly physical and/or
sexual abuse, 2) interpersonal violence; and 3) increased severity,
frequency, and violence of the trauma.

Genetic and physiological.

There are no genetic studies of dissociative amnesia. Studies of
dissociation report significant genetic and environmental factors in
both clinical and nonclinical samples.

Course modifiers.

Removal from the traumatic circumstances underlying the dissociative
amnesia (e.g., combat) may bring about a rapid return of memory. The
memory loss of individuals with dissociative fugue may be particularly
refractory. Onset of PTSD symptoms may decrease localized, selective, or
systematized amnesia. The returning memory, however, may be experienced
as flashbacks that alternate with amnesia for the content of the
flashbacks.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

In Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, non-epileptic seizures and
other functional neurological symptoms may accompany dissociative
amnesia. In cultures with highly restrictive social traditions, the
precipitants of dissociative amnesia often do not involve frank trauma.
Instead, the amnesia is preceded by severe psychological stresses or
conflicts (e.g., marital conflict, other family disturbances, attachment
problems, conflicts due to restriction or oppression).

Suicide Risk

Suicidal and other self-destructive behaviors are common in individuals
with dissociative amnesia. Suicidal behavior may be a particular risk
when the amnesia remits suddenly and overwhelms the individual with
intolerable memories.

Functional Consequences of Dissociative Amnesia

The impairment of individuals with localized, selective, or systematized
dissociative amnesia ranges from limited to severe. Individuals with
chronic generalized dissociative amnesia usually have impairment in all
aspects of functioning. Even when these individuals

"re-learn" aspects of their life history, autobiographical memory
remains very impaired.

Most become vocationally and interpersonally disabled.

Differential Diagnosis

Dissociative identity disorder.

Individuals with dissociative amnesia may report depersonalization and
auto-hypnotic symptoms. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder
report pervasive discontinuities in sense of self and agency,
accompanied by many other dissociative symptoms. The amnesias of
individuals with localized, selective, and/

or systematized dissociative amnesias are relatively stable. Amnesias in
dissociative identity disorder include amnesia for everyday events,
finding of unexplained possessions, sudden fluctuations in skills and
knowledge, major gaps in recall of life history, and brief amnesic gaps
in interpersonal interactions.

Posttraumatic stress disorder.

Some individuals with PTSD cannot recall part or all of a specific
traumatic event (e.g., a rape victim with depersonalization and/or
derealization symptoms who cannot recall most events for the entire day
of the rape). When that amnesia extends beyond the immediate time of the
trauma, a comorbid diagnosis of dissociative amnesia is warranted.

Neurocognitive disorders.

In neurocognitive disorders, memory loss for personal information is
usually embedded in cognitive, linguistic, affective, attentional, and
behavioral

[]{#index_split_028.html#p346}Dissociative Amnesia

**301**

disturbances. In dissociative amnesia, memory deficits are primarily for
autobiographical information; intellectual and cognitive abilities are
preserved.

Substance-related disorders.

In the context of repeated intoxication with alcohol or other
substances/medications, there may be episodes of "black outs" or periods
for which the individual has no memory. To aid in distinguishing these
episodes from dissociative amnesia, a longitudinal history noting that
the amnestic episodes occur only in the context of intoxication and do
not occur in other situations would help identify the source as
substance-induced; however the distinction may be difficult when the
individual with dissociative amnesia may also misuse alcohol or other
substances in the context of stressful situations that may also
exacerbate dissociative symptoms. Some individuals with comorbid
dissociative amnesia and substance use disorders will attribute their
memory problems solely to the substance use. Prolonged use of alcohol or
other substances may result in a substance-induced neurocognitive
disorder that may be associated with impaired cognitive function, but in
this context the protracted history of substance use and the persistent
deficits associated with the neurocognitive disorder would serve to
distinguish it from dissociative amnesia, where there is typically no
evidence of persistent impairment in intellectual functioning.

Posttraumatic amnesia due to brain injury.

Amnesia may occur in the context of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) when
there has been an impact to the head or other mechanisms of rapid
movement or displacement of the brain within the skull TBI. Other
characteristics of TBI include loss of consciousness, disorientation and
confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological signs (e.g.,
abnormalities on neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked
worsening of a preexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts,
anosmia). A neurocognitive disorder attributable to TBI must present
either immediately after brain injury occurs or immediately after the
individual recovers consciousness after the injury, and persist past the
acute post-injury period. The cognitive presentation of a neurocognitive
disorder following TBI is variable and includes difficulties in the
domains of complex attention, executive function, learning and memory as
well as slowed speed of information processing and disturbances in
social cognition. These additional features help distinguish it from
dissociative amnesia.

Seizure disorders.

Individuals with seizure disorders may exhibit complex behavior during
seizures or postictally with subsequent amnesia. Some individuals with a
seizure disorder engage in nonpurposive wandering that is limited to the
period of seizure activity. Conversely, behavior during a dissociative
fugue is usually purposeful, complex, and goal-directed and may last for
days, weeks, or longer. Occasionally, individuals with a seizure
disorder will report that earlier autobiographical memories have been
"wiped out" as the seizure disorder progresses. Such memory loss is not
associated with traumatic circumstances and appears to occur randomly.
Serial electroencephalograms usually show abnormalities. Telemet-ric
electroencephalographic monitoring usually shows an association between
the episodes of amnesia and seizure activity. Dissociative and epileptic
amnesias may coexist.

Catatonic stupor.

Mutism in catatonic stupor may suggest dissociative amnesia, but failure
of recall is absent. Other catatonic symptoms (e.g., rigidity,
posturing, negativism) are usually present.

Factitious disorder and malingering.

There is no test, battery of tests, or set of procedures that invariably
distinguishes dissociative amnesia from feigned amnesia. Individuals
with factitious disorder or malingering have been noted to continue
their deception even during hypnotic or barbiturate-facilitated
interviews. Feigned amnesia is more common in individuals with 1) acute,
florid dissociative amnesia; 2) financial, sexual, or legal problems; or
3) a wish to escape stressful circumstances. True amnesia can be
associated with those same circumstances. Many individuals who malinger
confess spontaneously or when confronted.

[]{#index_split_028.html#p347}**302**

Dissociative Disorders

Normal and age-related changes in memory.

Memory decrements in major and mild

neurocognitive disorders differ from those of dissociative amnesia,
which are usually associated with stressful events and are more
specific, extensive, and/or complex.

Comorbidity

As dissociative amnesia begins to remit, a wide variety of affective
phenomena may surface: dysphoria, grief, rage, shame, guilt,
psychological conflict and turmoil, and suicidal and homicidal ideation,
impulses, and acts. These individuals may have symptoms that then meet
diagnostic criteria for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia);
major depressive disorder; other specified or unspecified depressive
disorder; adjustment disorder, with depressed mood; or adjustment
disorder, with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct. Many
individuals with dissociative amnesia develop PTSD at some point during
their life, especially when the traumatic antecedents of their amnesia
are brought into conscious awareness.

Many individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet
diagnostic criteria for a comorbid somatic symptom or related disorder
(and vice versa), including somatic symptom disorder and conversion
disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). Many individuals
with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria
for a personality disorder, especially dependent, avoidant, and
borderline.

Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.6 (F48.1)**

A. The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of
depersonalization, derealization, or both:

1\. **Depersonalization:** Experiences of unreality, detachment, or
being an outside observer with respect to one's thoughts, feelings,
sensations, body, or actions (e.g., perceptual alterations, distorted
sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and/

or physical numbing).

2\. **Derealization:** Experiences of unreality or detachment with
respect to surroundings (e.g., individuals or objects are experienced as
unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted).

B. During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality
testing remains intact.

C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, medication) or another medical
condition (e.g., seizures).

E. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder,
such as schizophrenia, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, acute
stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or another dissociative
disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of depersonalization/derealization disorder are
persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or
both. Episodes of depersonalization are characterized by a feeling of
unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, one's whole self or
from aspects of the self (Criterion A1). The individual may feel
detached from his or her entire being (e.g., "I am no one," "I have no
self"). He or she may also feel subjectively detached from aspects of
the self, including feelings (e.g., hypoemotionality:
[]{#index_split_028.html#p348}Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder
**303**

"I know I have feelings but I don't feel them"), thoughts (e.g., "My
thoughts don't feel like my own," "head filled with cotton"), whole body
or body parts, or sensations (e.g., touch, proprioception, hunger,
thirst, libido). There may also be a diminished sense of agency (e.g.,
feeling robotic, like an automaton; lacking control of one's speech or
movements).

The depersonalization experience can sometimes be one of a split self,
with one part observing and one participating, known as an "out-of-body
experience" in its most extreme form. The unitary symptom of
"depersonalization" consists of several symptom factors: anomalous body
experiences (i.e., unreality of the self and perceptual alterations);
emotional or physical numbing; and temporal distortions with anomalous
subjective recall.

Episodes of derealization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or
detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals,
inanimate objects, or all surroundings (Criterion A2). The individual
may feel as if he or she were in a fog, dream, or bubble, or as if there
were a veil or a glass wall between the individual and world around.
Surroundings may be experienced as artificial, colorless, or lifeless.
Derealization is commonly accompanied by subjective visual distortions,
such as blurriness, heightened acuity, widened or narrowed visual field,
two-dimensionality or flatness, exaggerated three-dimensionality, or
altered distance or size of objects (i.e., macropsia or micropsia).
Auditory distortions can also occur, whereby voices or sounds are muted
or heightened. In addition, Criterion C requires the presence of
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning, and Criteria D and E describe
exclusionary diagnoses.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder may have
difficulty describing their symptoms and may think they are "crazy" or
"going crazy". Another common experience is the fear of irreversible
brain damage. A commonly associated symptom is a subjectively altered
sense of time (i.e., too fast or too slow), as well as a subjective
difficulty in vividly recalling past memories and owning them as
personal and emotional. Vague somatic symptoms, such as head fullness,
tingling, or lightheadedness, are not uncommon.

Individuals may suffer extreme rumination or obsessional preoccupation
(e.g., constantly obsessing about whether they really exist, or checking
their perceptions to determine whether they appear real). Varying
degrees of anxiety and depression are also common associated features.
Individuals with the disorder have been found to have physiological
hyporeactivity to emotional stimuli. Neural substrates of interest
include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, inferior
parietal lobule, and prefrontal cortical-limbic circuits.

Prevalence

Transient depersonalization/derealization symptoms lasting hours to days
are common in the general population. The 12-month prevalence of
depersonalization/derealization disorder is thought to be markedly less
than for transient symptoms, although precise estimates for the disorder
are unavailable. In general, approximately one-half of all adults have
experienced at least one lifetime episode of
depersonalization/derealization. However, symptomatology that meets full
criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder is markedly less
common than transient symptoms. Lifetime prevalence in U.S. and non-U.S.
countries is approximately 2% (range of 0.8% to 2.8%). The gender ratio
for the disorder is 1:1.

Development and Course

The mean age at onset of depersonalization/derealization disorder is 16
years, although the disorder can start in early or middle childhood; a
minority cannot recall ever not having had

[]{#index_split_028.html#p349}**304**

Dissociative Disorders

the symptoms. Less than 20% of individuals experience onset after age 20
years and only 5% after age 25 years. Onset in the fourth decade of life
or later is highly unusual. Onset can range from extremely sudden to
gradual. Duration of depersonalization/derealization disorder episodes
can vary greatly, from brief (hours or days) to prolonged (weeks,
months, or years). Given the rarity of disorder onset after age 40
years, in such cases the individual should be examined more closely for
underlying medical conditions (e.g., brain lesions, seizure disorders,
sleep apnea). The course of the disorder is often persistent.

About one-third of cases involve discrete episodes; another third,
continuous symptoms from the start; and still another third, an
initially episodic course that eventually becomes continuous.

While in some individuals the intensity of symptoms can wax and wane
considerably, others report an unwavering level of intensity that in
extreme cases can be constantly present for years or decades. Internal
and external factors that affect symptom intensity vary between
individuals, yet some typical patterns are reported. Exacerbations can
be triggered by stress, worsening mood or anxiety symptoms, novel or
overstimulating settings, and physical factors such as lighting or lack
of sleep.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder are
characterized by harm-avoidant temperament, immature defenses, and both
disconnection and overconnection schemata. Immature defenses such as
idealization/devaluation, projection and acting out result in denial of
reality and poor adaptation. *Cognitive disconnection* *schemata*
reflect defectiveness and emotional inhibition and subsume themes of
abuse, neglect, and deprivation. *Overconnection schemata* involve
impaired autonomy with themes of dependency, vulnerability, and
incompetence.

Environmental.

There is a clear association between the disorder and childhood
interpersonal traumas in a substantial portion of individuals, although
this association is not as prevalent or as extreme in the nature of the
traumas as in other dissociative disorders, such as dissociative
identity disorder. In particular, emotional abuse and emotional neglect
have been most strongly and consistently associated with the disorder.
Other stressors can include physical abuse; witnessing domestic
violence; growing up with a seriously impaired, mentally ill parent; or
unexpected death or suicide of a family member or close friend. Sexual
abuse is a much less common antecedent but can be encountered. The most
common proximal precipitants of the disorder are severe stress
(interpersonal, financial, occupational), depression, anxiety
(particularly panic attacks), and illicit drug use. Symptoms may be
specifically induced by substances such as tetrahydrocannabinol,
hallucinogens, ketamine, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine;
"ecstasy") and salvia. Marijuana use may precipitate new-onset panic
attacks and depersonalization/derealization symptoms simultaneously.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Volitionally induced experiences of depersonalization/derealization can
be a part of meditative practices that are prevalent in many religions
and cultures and should not be diagnosed as a disorder. However, there
are individuals who initially induce these states intentionally but over
time lose control over them and may develop a fear and aversion for
related practices.

Functional Consequences of

Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

Symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder are highly
distressing and are associated with major morbidity. The affectively
flattened and robotic demeanor that these

[]{#index_split_028.html#p350}Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder
**305**

individuals often demonstrate may appear incongruent with the extreme
emotional pain reported by those with the disorder. Impairment is often
experienced in both interpersonal and occupational spheres, largely due
to the hypoemotionality with others, subjective difficulty in focusing
and retaining information, and a general sense of disconnectedness from
life.

Differential Diagnosis

Illness anxiety disorder.

Although individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder can
present with vague somatic complaints as well as fears of permanent
brain damage, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder
is characterized by the presence of a constellation of typical
depersonalization/derealization symptoms and the absence of other
manifestations of illness anxiety disorder.

Major depressive disorder.

Feelings of numbness, deadness, apathy, and being in a dream are not
uncommon in major depressive episodes. However, in depersonalization/

derealization disorder, such symptoms are associated with further
symptoms of the disorder. If the depersonalization/derealization clearly
precedes the onset of a major depressive episode or clearly continues
after its resolution, the diagnosis of depersonalization/

derealization disorder applies.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Some individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder can
become obsessively preoccupied with their subjective experience or
develop rituals checking on the status of their symptoms. However, other
symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder unrelated to
depersonalization/derealization are not present.

Other dissociative disorders.

In order to diagnose depersonalization/derealization

disorder, the symptoms should not occur in the context of another
dissociative disorder, such as dissociative identity disorder.
Differentiation from dissociative amnesia and conversion disorder
(functional neurological symptom disorder) is simpler, as the symptoms
of these disorders do not overlap with those of
depersonalization/derealization disorder.

Anxiety disorders.

Depersonalization/derealization is one of the symptoms of panic attacks,
increasingly common as panic attack severity increases. Therefore,
depersonalization/derealization disorder should not be diagnosed when
the symptoms occur only during panic attacks that are part of panic
disorder, social anxiety disorder, or specific phobia. In addition, it
is not uncommon for depersonalization/derealization symptoms to first
begin in the context of new-onset panic attacks or as panic disorder
progresses and worsens. In such presentations, the diagnosis of
depersonalization/derealization disorder can be made if 1) the
depersonalization/derealization component of the presentation is very
prominent from the start, clearly exceeding in duration and intensity
the occurrence of actual panic attacks; or 2) the
depersonalization/derealization continues after panic disorder has
remitted or has been successfully treated.

Psychotic disorders.

The presence of intact reality testing specifically regarding the
depersonalization/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiating
depersonalization/derealization disorder from psychotic disorders.
Rarely, positive-symptom schizophrenia can pose a diagnostic challenge
when nihilistic delusions are present. For example, an individual may
complain that he or she is dead or the world is not real; this could be
either a subjective experience that the individual knows is not true or
a delusional conviction.

Substance/medication-induced disorders.

Depersonalization/derealization associated

with the physiological effects of substances during acute intoxication
or withdrawal is not diagnosed as depersonalization/derealization
disorder. The most common precipitating substances are the illicit drugs
marijuana, hallucinogens, ketamine, ecstasy, and salvia. In

[]{#index_split_028.html#p351}**306**

Dissociative Disorders

about 15% of all cases of depersonalization/derealization disorder, the
symptoms are precipitated by ingestion of such substances. If the
symptoms persist for some time in the absence of any further substance
or medication use, the diagnosis of depersonalization/

derealization disorder applies. This diagnosis is usually easy to
establish since the vast majority of individuals with this presentation
become highly phobic and aversive to the triggering substance and do not
use it again.

Mental disorders due to another medical condition.

Features such as onset after age

40 years or the presence of atypical symptoms and course in any
individual suggest the possibility of an underlying medical condition.
In such cases, it is essential to conduct a thorough medical and
neurological evaluation, which may include standard laboratory studies,
viral titers, an electroencephalogram, vestibular testing, visual
testing, sleep studies, and/or brain imaging. When the suspicion of an
underlying seizure disorder proves difficult to confirm, an ambulatory
electroencephalogram may be indicated; although temporal lobe epilepsy
is most commonly implicated, parietal and frontal lobe epilepsy may also
be associated.

Comorbidity

In a convenience sample of adults recruited for a number of
depersonalization research studies, lifetime comorbidities were high for
unipolar depressive disorder and for any anxiety disorder, with a
significant proportion of the sample having both disorders. Comorbidity
with posttraumatic stress disorder was low. The three most commonly
co-occurring personality disorders were avoidant, borderline, and
obsessive-compulsive.

Other Specified Dissociative Disorder

**300.15 (F44.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific dissociative
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified dissociative
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "dissociative trance").

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following:

1\. **Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms:**
This category includes identity disturbance associated with
less-than-marked discontinuities in sense of self and agency, or
alterations of identity or episodes of possession in an individual who
reports no dissociative amnesia.

2\. **Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive
persuasion:** Individuals who have been subjected to intense coercive
persuasion (e.g., brainwashing, thought reform, indoctrination while
captive, torture, long-term political imprisonment, recruitment by
sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with prolonged
changes in, or conscious questioning of, their identity.

3\. **Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events:** This category
is for acute, transient conditions that typically last less than 1
month, and sometimes only a few hours or days. These conditions are
characterized by constriction of consciousness; depersonalization;
derealization; perceptual disturbances (e.g., time slowing, macropsia);

[]{#index_split_028.html#p352}Unspecified Dissociative Disorder

**307**

micro-amnesias; transient stupor; and/or alterations in sensory-motor
functioning (e.g., analgesia, paralysis).

4\. **Dissociative trance:** This condition is characterized by an acute
narrowing or complete loss of awareness of immediate surroundings that
manifests as profound unresponsiveness or insensitivity to environmental
stimuli. The unresponsiveness may be accompanied by minor stereotyped
behaviors (e.g., finger movements) of which the individual is unaware
and/or that he or she cannot control, as well as transient paralysis or
loss of consciousness. The dissociative trance is not a normal part of a
broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.

Unspecified Dissociative Disorder

**300.15 (F44.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in
which the clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason that the
criteria are not met for a specific dissociative disorder, and includes
presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

[]{#index_split_028.html#p354}**Somatic Symptom and**

**Related Disorders**

[]{#index_split_029.html}

Somatic symptom disorder and other disorders with prominent somatic
symptoms constitute a new category in DSM-5 called *somatic symptom and
related disorders.* This chapter includes the diagnoses of somatic
symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder
(functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors
affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified
somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom
and related disorder. All of the disorders in this chapter share a
common feature: the prominence of somatic symptoms associated with
significant distress and impairment. Individuals with disorders with
prominent somatic symptoms are commonly encountered in primary care and
other medical settings but are less commonly encountered in psychiatric
and other mental health settings. These reconceptualized diagnoses,
based on a reorganization of DSM-IV somatoform disorder diagnoses, are
more useful for primary care and other medical (nonpsychiatric)
clinicians.

The major diagnosis in this diagnostic class, somatic symptom disorder,
emphasizes diagnosis made on the basis of positive symptoms and signs
(distressing somatic symptoms plus abnormal thoughts, feelings, and
behaviors in response to these symptoms) rather than the absence of a
medical explanation for somatic symptoms. A distinctive characteristic
of many individuals with somatic symptom disorder is not the somatic
symptoms per se, but instead the way they present and interpret them.
Incorporating affective, cognitive, and behavioral components into the
criteria for somatic symptom disorder provides a more comprehensive and
accurate reflection of the true clinical picture than can be achieved by
assessing the somatic complaints alone.

The principles behind the changes in the somatic symptom and related
diagnoses from DSM-IV are crucial in understanding the DSM-5 diagnoses.
The DSM-IV term *somatoform* *disorders* was confusing and is replaced
by *somatic symptom and related disorders*. In DSM-IV

there was a great deal of overlap across the somatoform disorders and a
lack of clarity about the boundaries of diagnoses. Although individuals
with these disorders primarily present in medical rather than mental
health settings, nonpsychiatric physicians found the DSM-IV somatoform
diagnoses difficult to understand and use. The current DSM-5
classification recognizes this overlap by reducing the total number of
disorders as well as their subcategories.

The previous criteria overemphasized the centrality of medically
unexplained symptoms.

Such symptoms are present to various degrees, particularly in conversion
disorder, but somatic symptom disorders can also accompany diagnosed
medical disorders. The reliability of determining that a somatic symptom
is medically unexplained is limited, and grounding a diagnosis on the
absence of an explanation is problematic and reinforces mind-body
dualism. It is not appropriate to give an individual a mental disorder
diagnosis solely because a medical cause cannot be demonstrated.
Furthermore, the presence of a medical diagnosis does not exclude the
possibility of a comorbid mental disorder, including a somatic symptom
and related disorder. Perhaps because of the predominant focus on lack
of medical explanation, individuals regarded these diagnoses as
pejorative and demeaning, implying that their physical symptoms were not
"real." The new classification defines the major diagnosis, somatic
symptom disorder, on the basis of positive symptoms (distressing somatic
symptoms plus abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in response
**309**

[]{#index_split_029.html#p355}**310**

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

to these symptoms). However, medically unexplained symptoms remain a key
feature in conversion disorder and pseudocyesis (other specified somatic
symptom and related disorder) because it is possible to demonstrate
definitively in such disorders that the symptoms are not consistent with
medical pathophysiology.

It is important to note that some other mental disorders may initially
manifest with primarily somatic symptoms (e.g., major depressive
disorder, panic disorder). Such diagnoses may account for the somatic
symptoms, or they may occur alongside one of the somatic symptom and
related disorders in this chapter. There is also considerable medical
comorbidity among somatizing individuals. Although somatic symptoms are
frequently associated with psychological distress and psychopathology,
some somatic symptom and related disorders can arise spontaneously, and
their causes can remain obscure. Anxiety disorders and depressive
disorders may accompany somatic symptom and related disorders. The
somatic component adds severity and complexity to depressive and anxiety
disorders and results in higher severity, functional impairment, and
even refractoriness to traditional treatments. In rare instances, the
degree of preoccupation may be so severe as to warrant consideration of
a delusional disorder diagnosis.

A number of factors may contribute to somatic symptom and related
disorders. These include genetic and biological vulnerability (e.g.,
increased sensitivity to pain), early traumatic experiences (e.g.,
violence, abuse, deprivation), and learning (e.g., attention obtained
from illness, lack of reinforcement of nonsomatic expressions of
distress), as well as cultural/social norms that devalue and stigmatize
psychological suffering as compared with physical suffering. Differences
in medical care across cultures affect the presentation, recognition,
and management of these somatic presentations. Variations in symptom
presentation are likely the result of the interaction of multiple
factors within cultural contexts that affect how individuals identify
and classify bodily sensations, perceive illness, and seek medical
attention for them. Thus, somatic presentations can be viewed as
expressions of personal suffering inserted in a cultural and social
context.

All of these disorders are characterized by the prominent focus on
somatic concerns and their initial presentation mainly in medical rather
than mental health care settings. Somatic symptom disorder offers a more
clinically useful method of characterizing individuals who may have been
considered in the past for a diagnosis of somatization disorder.

Furthermore, approximately 75% of individuals previously diagnosed with
hypochondriasis are subsumed under the diagnosis of somatic symptom
disorder. However, about 25% of individuals with hypochondriasis have
high health anxiety in the absence of somatic symptoms, and many such
individuals' symptoms would not qualify for an anxiety disorder
diagnosis. The DSM-5 diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder is for this
latter group of individuals. Illness anxiety disorder can be considered
either in this diagnostic section or as an anxiety disorder. Because of
the strong focus on somatic concerns, and because illness anxiety
disorder is most often encountered in medical settings, for utility it
is listed with the somatic symptom and related disorders. In conversion
disorder, the essential feature is neurological symptoms that are found,
after appropriate neurological assessment, to be incompatible with
neurological pathophysiology. Psychological factors affecting other
medical conditions is also included in this chapter. Its essential
feature is the presence of one or more clinically significant
psychological or behavioral factors that adversely affect a medical
condition by increasing the risk for suffering, death, or disability.
Like the other somatic symptom and related disorders, factitious
disorder embodies persistent problems related to illness perception and
identity. In the great majority of reported cases of factitious
disorder, both imposed on self and imposed on another, individuals
present with somatic symptoms and medical disease conviction.
Consequently, DSM-5 factitious disorder is included among the somatic
symptom and related disorders. Other specified somatic symptom and
related disorder and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder
include conditions for which some, but not all, of the criteria for
somatic symptom disorder or illness anxiety disorder are met, as well as
pseudocyesis.

Somatic Symptom Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.82 (F45.1)**

A. One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in
significant disruption of daily life.

B. Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic
symptoms or associated health concerns as manifested by at least one of
the following: 1. Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the
seriousness of one's symptoms.

2\. Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms.

3\. Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health
concerns.

C. Although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the
state of being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months).

*Specify* if:

**With predominant pain** (previously pain disorder): This specifier is
for individuals whose somatic symptoms predominantly involve pain.

*Specify* if:

**Persistent:** A persistent course is characterized by severe symptoms,
marked impairment, and long duration (more than 6 months).

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Only one of the symptoms specified in Criterion B is
fulfilled.

**Moderate:** Two or more of the symptoms specified in Criterion B are
fulfilled.

**Severe:** Two or more of the symptoms specified in Criterion B are
fulfilled, plus there are multiple somatic complaints (or one very
severe somatic symptom).

Diagnostic Features

Individuals with somatic symptom disorder typically have multiple,
current, somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant
disruption of daily life (Criterion A), although sometimes only one
severe symptom, most commonly pain, is present. Symptoms may be specific
(e.g., localized pain) or relatively nonspecific (e.g., fatigue). The
symptoms sometimes represent normal bodily sensations or discomfort that
does not generally signify serious disease. Somatic symptoms without an
evident medical explanation are not sufficient to make this diagnosis.
The individual's suffering is authentic, whether or not it is medically
explained.

The symptoms may or may not be associated with another medical
condition. The diagnoses of somatic symptom disorder and a concurrent
medical illness are not mutually exclusive, and these frequently occur
together. For example, an individual may become seriously disabled by
symptoms of somatic symptom disorder after an uncomplicated myocardial
infarction even if the myocardial infarction itself did not result in
any disability. If another medical condition or high risk for developing
one is present (e.g., strong family history), the thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors associated with this condition are excessive (Criterion
B).

Individuals with somatic symptom disorder tend to have very high levels
of worry about illness (Criterion B). They appraise their bodily
symptoms as unduly threatening, harmful, or troublesome and often think
the worst about their health. Even when there is evidence to the
contrary, some patients still fear the medical seriousness of their
symptoms. In severe somatic symptom disorder, health concerns may assume
a central role in the individual's life, becoming a feature of his or
her identity and dominating interpersonal relationships.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p357}**312**

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

Individuals typically experience distress that is principally focused on
somatic symptoms and their significance. When asked directly about their
distress, some individuals describe it in relation to other aspects of
their lives, while others deny any source of distress other than the
somatic symptoms. Health-related quality of life is often impaired, both
physically and mentally. In severe somatic symptom disorder, the
impairment is marked, and when persistent, the disorder can lead to
invalidism.

There is often a high level of medical care utilization, which rarely
alleviates the individual's concerns. Consequently, the patient may seek
care from multiple doctors for the same symptoms. These individuals
often seem unresponsive to medical interventions, and new interventions
may only exacerbate the presenting symptoms. Some individuals with the
disorder seem unusually sensitive to medication side effects. Some feel
that their medical assessment and treatment have been inadequate.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Cognitive features include attention focused on somatic symptoms,
attribution of normal bodily sensations to physical illness (possibly
with catastrophic interpretations), worry about illness, and fear that
any physical activity may damage the body. The relevant associated
behavioral features may include repeated bodily checking for
abnormalities, repeated seeking of medical help and reassurance, and
avoidance of physical activity. These behavioral features are most
pronounced in severe, persistent somatic symptom disorder.

These features are usually associated with frequent requests for medical
help for different somatic symptoms. This may lead to medical
consultations in which individuals are so focused on their concerns
about somatic symptom(s) that they cannot be redirected to other
matters. Any reassurance by the doctor that the symptoms are not
indicative of serious physical illness tends to be short-lived and/or is
experienced by the individuals as the doctor not taking their symptoms
with due seriousness. As the focus on somatic symptoms is a primary
feature of the disorder, individuals with somatic symptom disorder
typically present to general medical health services rather than mental
health services. The suggestion of referral to a mental health
specialist may be met with surprise or even frank refusal by individuals
with somatic symptom disorder.

Since somatic symptom disorder is associated with depressive disorders,
there is an increased suicide risk. It is not known whether somatic
symptom disorder is associated with suicide risk independent of its
association with depressive disorders.

Prevalence

The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is not known. However, the
prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is expected to be higher than
that of the more restrictive DSM-IV somatization disorder (\<1%) but
lower than that of undifferentiated somatoform disorder (approximately
19%). The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder in the general adult
population may be around 5%--7%. Females tend to report more somatic
symptoms than do males, and the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder
is consequently likely to be higher in females.

Development and Course

In older individuals, somatic symptoms and concurrent medical illnesses
are common, and a focus on Criterion B is crucial for making the
diagnosis. Somatic symptom disorder may be underdiagnosed in older
adults either because certain somatic symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue) are
considered part of normal aging or because illness worry is considered

"understandable" in older adults who have more general medical illnesses
and medications than do younger people. Concurrent depressive disorder
is common in older people who present with numerous somatic symptoms.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p358}Somatic Symptom Disorder

**313**

In children, the most common symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain,
headache, fatigue, and nausea. A single prominent symptom is more common
in children than in adults. While young children may have somatic
complaints, they rarely worry about "illness" per se prior to
adolescence. The parents' response to the symptom is important, as this
may determine the level of associated distress. It is the parent who may
determine the interpretation of symptoms and the associated time off
school and medical help seeking.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

The personality trait of negative affectivity (neuroticism) has been
identified as an independent correlate/risk factor of a high number of
somatic symptoms. Comorbid anxiety or depression is common and may
exacerbate symptoms and impairment.

Environmental.

Somatic symptom disorder is more frequent in individuals with few years
of education and low socioeconomic status, and in those who have
recently experienced stressful life events.

Course modifiers.

Persistent somatic symptoms are associated with demographic features
(female sex, older age, fewer years of education, lower socioeconomic
status, unemployment), a reported history of sexual abuse or other
childhood adversity, concurrent chronic physical illness or psychiatric
disorder (depression, anxiety, persistent depressive disorder
\[dysthymia\], panic), social stress, and reinforcing social factors
such as illness benefits. Cognitive factors that affect clinical course
include sensitization to pain, heightened attention to bodily
sensations, and attribution of bodily symptoms to a possible medical
illness rather than recognizing them as a normal phenomenon or
psychological stress.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Somatic symptoms are prominent in various "culture-bound syndromes."
High numbers of somatic symptoms are found in population-based and
primary care studies around the world, with a similar pattern of the
most commonly reported somatic symptoms, impairment, and treatment
seeking. The relationship between number of somatic symptoms and illness
worry is similar in different cultures, and marked illness worry is
associated with impairment and greater treatment seeking across
cultures. The relationship between numerous somatic symptoms and
depression appears to be very similar around the world and between
different cultures within one country.

Despite these similarities, there are differences in somatic symptoms
among cultures and ethnic groups. The description of somatic symptoms
varies with linguistic and other local cultural factors. These somatic
presentations have been described as "idioms of distress" because
somatic symptoms may have special meanings and shape patient-clinician
interactions in the particular cultural contexts. "Burnout," the
sensation of heaviness or the complaints of "gas"; too much heat in the
body; or burning in the head are examples of symptoms that are common in
some cultures or ethnic groups but rare in others. Explanatory models
also vary, and somatic symptoms may be attributed variously to
particular family, work, or environmental stresses; general medical
illness; the suppression of feelings of anger and resentment; or certain
culture-specific phenomena, such as semen loss.

There may also be differences in medical treatment seeking among
cultural groups, in addition to differences due to variable access to
medical care services. Seeking treatment for multiple somatic symptoms
in general medical clinics is a worldwide phenomenon and occurs at
similar rates among ethnic groups in the same country.

Functional Consequences of Somatic Symptom Disorder

The disorder is associated with marked impairment of health status. Many
individuals with severe somatic symptom disorder are likely to have
impaired health status scores more than 2 standard deviations below
population norms.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p359}**314**

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

Differential Diagnosis

If the somatic symptoms are consistent with another mental disorder
(e.g., panic disorder), and the diagnostic criteria for that disorder
are fulfilled, then that mental disorder should be considered as an
alternative or additional diagnosis. A separate diagnosis of somatic
symptom disorder is not made if the somatic symptoms and related
thoughts, feelings, or behaviors occur only during major depressive
episodes. If, as commonly occurs, the criteria for both somatic symptom
disorder and another mental disorder diagnosis are fulfilled, then both
should be coded, as both may require treatment.

Other medical conditions.

The presence of somatic symptoms of unclear etiology is not in itself
sufficient to make the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. The
symptoms of many individuals with disorders like irritable bowel
syndrome or fibromyalgia would not satisfy the criterion necessary to
diagnose somatic symptom disorder (Criterion B). Conversely, the
presence of somatic symptoms of an established medical disorder (e.g.,
diabetes or heart disease) does not exclude the diagnosis of somatic
symptom disorder if the criteria are otherwise met.

Panic disorder.

In panic disorder, somatic symptoms and anxiety about health tend to
occur in acute episodes, whereas in somatic symptom disorder, anxiety
and somatic symptoms are more persistent.

Generalized anxiety disorder.

Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry about multiple
events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve their
health. The main focus is not usually somatic symptoms or fear of
illness as it is in somatic symptom disorder.

Depressive disorders.

Depressive disorders are commonly accompanied by somatic symptoms.
However, depressive disorders are differentiated from somatic symptom
disorder by the core depressive symptoms of low (dysphoric) mood and
anhedonia.

Illness anxiety disorder.

If the individual has extensive worries about health but no or minimal
somatic symptoms, it may be more appropriate to consider illness anxiety
disorder.

Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).

In conversion disorder, the presenting symptom is loss of function
(e.g., of a limb), whereas in somatic symptom disorder, the focus is on
the distress that particular symptoms cause. The features listed under
Criterion B of somatic symptom disorder may be helpful in
differentiating the two disorders.

Delusional disorder.

In somatic symptom disorder, the individual's beliefs that somatic
symptoms might reflect serious underlying physical illness are not held
with delusional intensity. Nonetheless, the individual's beliefs
concerning the somatic symptoms can be firmly held. In contrast, in
delusional disorder, somatic subtype, the somatic symptom beliefs and
behavior are stronger than those found in somatic symptom disorder.

Body dysmorphic disorder.

In body dysmorphic disorder, the individual is excessively concerned
about, and preoccupied by, a perceived defect in his or her physical
features. In contrast, in somatic symptom disorder, the concern about
somatic symptoms reflects fear of underlying illness, not of a defect in
appearance.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

In somatic symptom disorder, the recurrent ideas about somatic symptoms
or illness are less intrusive, and individuals with this disorder do not
exhibit the associated repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing anxiety
that occur in obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Comorbidity

Somatic symptom disorder is associated with high rates of comorbidity
with medical disorders as well as anxiety and depressive disorders. When
a concurrent medical illness is

[]{#index_split_029.html#p360}Illness Anxiety Disorder

**315**

present, the degree of impairment is more marked than would be expected
from the physical illness alone. When an individual's symptoms meet
diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder, the disorder should be
diagnosed; however, in view of the frequent comorbidity, especially with
anxiety and depressive disorders, evidence for these concurrent
diagnoses should be sought.

Illness Anxiety Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.7 (F45.21)**

A. Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness.

B. Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in
intensity. If another medical condition is present or there is a high
risk for developing a medical condition (e.g., strong family history is
present), the preoccupation is clearly excessive or disproportionate.

C. There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is
easily alarmed about personal health status.

D. The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g.,
repeatedly checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits
maladaptive avoidance (e.g., avoids doctor appointments and hospitals).

E. Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but the
specific illness that is feared may change over that period of time.

F. The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another
mental disorder, such as somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic type.

*Specify* whether:

**Care-seeking type:** Medical care, including physician visits or
undergoing tests and procedures, is frequently used.

**Care-avoidant type:** Medical care is rarely used.

Diagnostic Features

Most individuals with hypochondriasis are now classified as having
somatic symptom disorder; however, in a minority of cases, the diagnosis
of illness anxiety disorder applies instead. Illness anxiety disorder
entails a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious, undiagnosed
medical illness (Criterion A). Somatic symptoms are not present or, if
present, are only mild in intensity (Criterion B). A thorough evaluation
fails to identify a serious medical condition that accounts for the
individual's concerns. While the concern may be derived from a
nonpathological physical sign or sensation, the individual's distress
emanates not primarily from the physical complaint itself but rather
from his or her anxiety about the meaning, significance, or cause of the
complaint (i.e., the suspected medical diagnosis). If a physical sign or
symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological sensation (e.g.,
orthostatic dizziness), a benign and self-limited dysfunction (e.g.,
transient tinnitus), or a bodily discomfort not generally considered
indicative of disease (e.g., belch-ing). If a diagnosable medical
condition is present, the individual's anxiety and preoccupation are
clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition
(Criterion B). Empirical evidence and existing literature pertain to
previously defined DSM hypochondriasis, and it is unclear to what extent
and how precisely they apply to the description of this new diagnosis.

The preoccupation with the idea that one is sick is accompanied by
substantial anxiety about health and disease (Criterion C). Individuals
with illness anxiety disorder are easily

[]{#index_split_029.html#p361}**316**

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

alarmed about illness, such as by hearing about someone else falling ill
or reading a health-related news story. Their concerns about undiagnosed
disease do not respond to appropriate medical reassurance, negative
diagnostic tests, or benign course. The physician's attempts at
reassurance and symptom palliation generally do not alleviate the
individual's concerns and may heighten them. Illness concerns assume a
prominent place in the individual's life, affecting daily activities,
and may even result in invalidism. Illness becomes a central feature of
the individual's identity and self-image, a frequent topic of social
discourse, and a characteristic response to stressful life events.
Individuals with the disorder often examine themselves repeatedly (e.g.,
examining one's throat in the mirror) (Criterion D). They research their
suspected disease excessively (e.g., on the Internet) and repeatedly
seek reassurance from family, friends, or physicians. This incessant
worrying often becomes frustrating for others and may result in
considerable strain within the family. In some cases, the anxiety leads
to maladaptive avoidance of situations (e.g., visiting sick family
members) or activities (e.g., exercise) that these individuals fear
might jeopardize their health.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Because they believe they are medically ill, individuals with illness
anxiety disorder are encountered far more frequently in medical than in
mental health settings. The majority of individuals with illness anxiety
disorder have extensive yet unsatisfactory medical care, though some may
be too anxious to seek medical attention. They generally have elevated
rates of medical utilization but do not utilize mental health services
more than the general population. They often consult multiple physicians
for the same problem and obtain repeatedly negative diagnostic test
results. At times, medical attention leads to a paradoxical exacerbation
of anxiety or to iatrogenic complications from diagnostic tests and
procedures. Individuals with the disorder are generally dissatisfied
with their medical care and find it unhelpful, often feeling they are
not being taken seriously by physicians. At times, these concerns may be
justified, since physicians sometimes are dismissive or respond with
frustration or hostility. This response can occasionally result in a
failure to diagnose a medical condition that is present.

Prevalence

Prevalence estimates of illness anxiety disorder are based on estimates
of the DSM-III and DSM-IV diagnosis *hypochondriasis.* The 1-to 2-year
prevalence of health anxiety and/or disease conviction in community
surveys and population-based samples ranges from 1.3%

to 10%. In ambulatory medical populations, the 6-month/1-year prevalence
rates are between 3% and 8%. The prevalence of the disorder is similar
in males and females.

Development and Course

The development and course of illness anxiety disorder are unclear.
Illness anxiety disorder is generally thought to be a chronic and
relapsing condition with an age at onset in early and middle adulthood.
In population-based samples, health-related anxiety increases with age,
but the ages of individuals with high health anxiety in medical settings
do not appear to differ from those of other patients in those settings.
In older individuals, health-related anxiety often focuses on memory
loss; the disorder is thought to be rare in children.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Illness anxiety disorder may sometimes be precipitated by a major life
stress or a serious but ultimately benign threat to the individual's
health. A history of child-

[]{#index_split_029.html#p362}Illness Anxiety Disorder

**317**

hood abuse or of a serious childhood illness may predispose to
development of the disorder in adulthood.

Course modifiers.

Approximately one-third to one-half of individuals with illness anxiety
disorder have a transient form, which is associated with less
psychiatric comorbidity, more medical comorbidity, and less severe
illness anxiety disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The diagnosis should be made with caution in individuals whose ideas
about disease are congruent with widely held, culturally sanctioned
beliefs. Little is known about the phenomenology of the disorder across
cultures, although the prevalence appears to be similar across different
countries with diverse cultures.

Functional Consequences of Illness Anxiety Disorder

Illness anxiety disorder causes substantial role impairment and
decrements in physical function and health-related quality of life.
Health concerns often interfere with interpersonal relationships,
disrupt family life, and damage occupational performance.

Differential Diagnosis

Other medical conditions.

The first differential diagnostic consideration is an underlying medical
condition, including neurological or endocrine conditions, occult
malignancies, and other diseases that affect multiple body systems. The
presence of a medical condition does not rule out the possibility of
coexisting illness anxiety disorder. If a medical condition is present,
the health-related anxiety and disease concerns are clearly
disproportionate to its seriousness. Transient preoccupations related to
a medical condition do not constitute illness anxiety disorder.

Adjustment disorders.

Health-related anxiety is a normal response to serious illness and is
not a mental disorder. Such nonpathological health anxiety is clearly
related to the medical condition and is typically time-limited. If the
health anxiety is severe enough, an adjustment disorder may be
diagnosed. However, only when the health anxiety is of sufficient
duration, severity, and distress can illness anxiety disorder be
diagnosed. Thus, the diagnosis requires the continuous persistence of
disproportionate health-related anxiety for at least 6 months.

Somatic symptom disorder.

Somatic symptom disorder is diagnosed when significant somatic symptoms
are present. In contrast, individuals with illness anxiety disorder have
minimal somatic symptoms and are primarily concerned with the idea they
are ill.

Anxiety disorders.

In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals worry about multiple
events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve health.
In panic disorder, the individual may be concerned that the panic
attacks reflect the presence of a medical illness; however, although
these individuals may have health anxiety, their anxiety is typically
very acute and episodic. In illness anxiety disorder, the health anxiety
and fears are more persistent and enduring. Individuals with illness
anxiety disorder may experience panic attacks that are triggered by
their illness concerns.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may have intrusive thoughts
about having a disease and also may have associated compulsive behaviors
(e.g., seeking reassurance). However, in illness anxiety disorder, the
preoccupations are usually focused on having a disease, whereas in
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the thoughts are intrusive and are
usually focused on fears of getting a disease in the future. Most
individuals with OCD have obsessions or compulsions involving other
concerns in addition to fears about contracting disease. In body
dysmorphic dis-

[]{#index_split_029.html#p363}**318**

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

order, concerns are limited to the individual's physical appearance,
which is viewed as defective or flawed.

Major depressive disorder.

Some individuals with a major depressive episode ruminate about their
health and worry excessively about illness. A separate diagnosis of
illness anxiety disorder is not made if these concerns occur only during
major depressive episodes. However, if excessive illness worry persists
after remission of an episode of major depressive disorder, the
diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder should be considered.

Psychotic disorders.

Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are not delusional and can
acknowledge the possibility that the feared disease is not present.
Their ideas do not attain the rigidity and intensity seen in the somatic
delusions occurring in psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia;
delusional disorder, somatic type; major depressive disorder, with
psychotic features). True somatic delusions are generally more bizarre
(e.g., that an organ is rotting or dead) than the concerns seen in
illness anxiety disorder. The concerns seen in illness anxiety disorder,
though not founded in reality, are plausible.

Comorbidity

Because illness anxiety disorder is a new disorder, exact comorbidities
are unknown. Hypochondriasis co-occurs with anxiety disorders (in
particular, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and OCD) and
depressive disorders. Approximately two-thirds of individuals with
illness anxiety disorder are likely to have at least one other comorbid
major mental disorder. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may
have an elevated risk for somatic symptom disorder and personality
disorders.

Conversion Disorder

(Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)

Diagnostic Criteria

A. One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function.

B. Clinical findings provide evidence of incompatibility between the
symptom and recognized neurological or medical conditions.

C. The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or
mental disorder.

D. The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning or warrants medical evaluation.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for conversion disorder is

Diagnostic Features

Many clinicians use the alternative names of "functional" (referring to
abnormal central nervous system functioning) or "psychogenic" (referring
to an assumed etiology) to describe the symptoms of conversion disorder
(functional neurological symptom disorder). In conversion disorder,
there may be one or more symptoms of various types. Motor symptoms
include weakness or paralysis; abnormal movements, such as tremor or
dystonic movements; gait abnormalities; and abnormal limb posturing.
Sensory symptoms include altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation,
vision, or hearing. Episodes of abnormal generalized limb shaking with
apparent impaired or loss of consciousness may resemble epileptic
seizures (also called *psychogenic* or *non-epileptic seizures*). There
may be episodes of unresponsiveness resembling syncope or coma. Other
symptoms include reduced or absent speech volume (dysphonia/aphonia),
altered articulation (dysarthria), a sensation of a lump in the throat
(globus), and diplopia.

Although the diagnosis requires that the symptom is not explained by
neurological disease, it should not be made simply because results from
investigations are normal or because the symptom is "bizarre." There
must be clinical findings that show clear evidence of incompatibility
with neurological disease. Internal inconsistency at examination is one
way to demonstrate incompatibility (i.e., demonstrating that physical
signs elicited through one examination method are no longer positive
when tested a different way). Examples of such examination findings
include • Hoover's sign, in which weakness of hip extension returns to
normal strength with con-tralateral hip flexion against resistance.

• Marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion when tested on the bed in an
individual who is able to walk on tiptoes;

• Positive findings on the tremor entrainment test. On this test, a
unilateral tremor may be identified as functional if the tremor changes
when the individual is distracted away from it. This may be observed if
the individual is asked to copy the examiner in making a rhythmical
movement with their unaffected hand and this causes the functional
tremor to change such that it copies or "entrains" to the rhythm of the
unaffected hand or the functional tremor is suppressed, or no longer
makes a simple rhythmical movement.

• In attacks resembling epilepsy or syncope ("psychogenic" non-epileptic
attacks), the occurrence of closed eyes with resistance to opening or a
normal simultaneous electroencephalogram (although this alone does not
exclude all forms of epilepsy or syncope).

• For visual symptoms, a tubular visual field (i.e., tunnel vision).

It is important to note that the diagnosis of conversion disorder should
be based on the overall clinical picture and not on a single clinical
finding.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A number of associated features can support the diagnosis of conversion
disorder. There may be a history of multiple similar somatic symptoms.
Onset may be associated with stress or trauma, either psychological or
physical in nature. The potential etiological rele-

[]{#index_split_029.html#p365}**320**

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

vance of this stress or trauma may be suggested by a close temporal
relationship. However, while assessment for stress and trauma is
important, the diagnosis should not be withheld if none is found.

Conversion disorder is often associated with dissociative symptoms, such
as depersonalization, derealization, and dissociative amnesia,
particularly at symptom onset or during attacks.

The diagnosis of conversion disorder does not require the judgment that
the symptoms are not intentionally produced (i.e., not feigned), as the
definite absence of feigning may not be reliably discerned. The
phenomenon of *la belle indifférence* (i.e., lack of concern about the
nature or implications of the symptom) has been associated with
conversion disorder but it is not specific for conversion disorder and
should not be used to make the diagnosis.

Similarly the concept of *secondary gain* (i.e., when individuals derive
external benefits such as money or release from responsibilities) is
also not specific to conversion disorder and particularly in the context
of definite evidence for feigning, the diagnoses that should be
considered instead would include factitious disorder or malingering (see
the section "Differential Diagnosis" for this disorder).

Prevalence

Transient conversion symptoms are common, but the precise prevalence of
the disorder is unknown. This is partly because the diagnosis usually
requires assessment in secondary care, where it is found in
approximately 5% of referrals to neurology clinics. The incidence of
individual persistent conversion symptoms is estimated to be
2--5/100,000 per year.

Development and Course

Onset has been reported throughout the life course. The onset of
non-epileptic attacks peaks in the third decade, and motor symptoms have
their peak onset in the fourth decade.

The symptoms can be transient or persistent. The prognosis may be better
in younger children than in adolescents and adults.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Maladaptive personality traits are commonly associated with conversion
disorder.

Environmental.

There may be a history of childhood abuse and neglect. Stressful life
events are often, but not always, present.

Genetic and physiological.

The presence of neurological disease that causes similar symptoms is a
risk factor (e.g., non-epileptic seizures are more common in patients
who also have epilepsy).

Course modifiers.

Short duration of symptoms and acceptance of the diagnosis are positive
prognostic factors. Maladaptive personality traits, the presence of
comorbid physical disease, and the receipt of disability benefits may be
negative prognostic factors.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Changes resembling conversion (and dissociative) symptoms are common in
certain culturally sanctioned rituals. If the symptoms are fully
explained within the particular cultural context and do not result in
clinically significant distress or disability, then the diagnosis of
conversion disorder is not made.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Conversion disorder is two to three times more common in females.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p366}Conversion Disorder (Functional
Neurological Symptom Disorder) **321**

Functional Consequences of Conversion Disorder

Individuals with conversion symptoms may have substantial disability.
The severity of disability can be similar to that experienced by
individuals with comparable medical diseases.

Differential Diagnosis

If another mental disorder better explains the symptoms, that diagnosis
should be made.

However the diagnosis of conversion disorder may be made in the presence
of another mental disorder.

Neurological disease.

The main differential diagnosis is neurological disease that might
better explain the symptoms. After a thorough neurological assessment,
an unexpected neurological disease cause for the symptoms is rarely
found at follow up. However, reassessment may be required if the
symptoms appear to be progressive. Conversion disorder may coexist with
neurological disease.

Somatic symptom disorder.

Conversion disorder may be diagnosed in addition to somatic symptom
disorder. Most of the somatic symptoms encountered in somatic symptom
disorder cannot be demonstrated to be clearly incompatible with
pathophysiology (e.g., pain, fatigue), whereas in conversion disorder,
such incompatibility is required for the diagnosis. The excessive
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors characterizing somatic symptom
disorder are often absent in conversion disorder.

Factitious disorder and malingering.

The diagnosis of conversion disorder does not require the judgment that
the symptoms are *not* intentionally produced (i.e., not feigned),
because assessment of conscious intention is unreliable. However
definite evidence of feigning (e.g., clear evidence that loss of
function is present during the examination but not at home) would
suggest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual's apparent
aim is to assume the sick role or malingering if the aim is to obtain an
incentive such as money.

Dissociative disorders.

Dissociative symptoms are common in individuals with conversion
disorder. If both conversion disorder and a dissociative disorder are
present, both diagnoses should be made.

Body dysmorphic disorder.

Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are excessively concerned
about a perceived defect in their physical features but do not complain
of symptoms of sensory or motor functioning in the affected body part.

Depressive disorders.

In depressive disorders, individuals may report general heaviness of
their limbs, whereas the weakness of conversion disorder is more focal
and prominent. Depressive disorders are also differentiated by the
presence of core depressive symptoms.

Panic disorder.

Episodic neurological symptoms (e.g., tremors and paresthesias) can
occur in both conversion disorder and panic attacks. In panic attacks,
the neurological symptoms are typically transient and acutely episodic
with characteristic cardiorespiratory symptoms. Loss of awareness with
amnesia for the attack and violent limb movements occur in non-epileptic
attacks, but not in panic attacks.

Comorbidity

Anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder, and depressive disorders
commonly co-occur with conversion disorder. Somatic symptom disorder may
co-occur as well. Psychosis, substance use disorder, and alcohol misuse
are uncommon. Personality disorders are more common in individuals with
conversion disorder than in the general population. Neurological or
other medical conditions commonly coexist with conversion disorder as
well.

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

Psychological Factors Affecting

Other Medical Conditions

Diagnostic Criteria

**316 (F54)**

A. A medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is
present.

B. Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical
condition in one of the following ways:

1\. The factors have influenced the course of the medical condition as
shown by a close temporal association between the psychological factors
and the development or exacerbation of, or delayed recovery from, the
medical condition.

2\. The factors interfere with the treatment of the medical condition
(e.g., poor adherence).

3\. The factors constitute additional well-established health risks for
the individual.

4\. The factors influence the underlying pathophysiology, precipitating
or exacerbating symptoms or necessitating medical attention.

C. The psychological and behavioral factors in Criterion B are not
better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder, major
depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder).

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Increases medical risk (e.g., inconsistent adherence with
antihypertension treatment).

**Moderate:** Aggravates underlying medical condition (e.g., anxiety
aggravating asthma).

**Severe:** Results in medical hospitalization or emergency room visit.

**Extreme:** Results in severe, life-threatening risk (e.g., ignoring
heart attack symptoms).

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of psychological factors affecting other medical
conditions is the presence of one or more clinically significant
psychological or behavioral factors that adversely affect a medical
condition by increasing the risk for suffering, death, or disability
(Criterion B). These factors can adversely affect the medical condition
by influencing its course or treatment, by constituting an additional
well-established health risk factor, or by influencing the underlying
pathophysiology to precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or to necessitate
medical attention.

Psychological or behavioral factors include psychological distress,
patterns of interpersonal interaction, coping styles, and maladaptive
health behaviors, such as denial of symptoms or poor adherence to
medical recommendations. Common clinical examples are
anxiety-exacerbating asthma, denial of need for treatment for acute
chest pain, and manipulation of insulin by an individual with diabetes
wishing to lose weight. Many different psychological factors have been
demonstrated to adversely influence medical conditions--- for example,
symptoms of depression or anxiety, stressful life events, relationship
style, personality traits, and coping styles. The adverse effects can
range from acute, with immediate medical consequences (e.g., Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy) to chronic, occurring over a long period of time (e.g.,
chronic occupational stress increasing risk for hypertension). Affected
medical conditions can be those with clear pathophysiology (e.g.,
diabetes, cancer, coronary disease), functional syndromes (e.g.,
migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia), or idiopathic medical
symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, dizziness).

[]{#index_split_029.html#p368}Psychological Factors Affecting Other
Medical Conditions **323**

This diagnosis should be reserved for situations in which the effect of
the psychological factor on the medical condition is evident and the
psychological factor has clinically significant effects on the course or
outcome of the medical condition. Abnormal psychological or behavioral
symptoms that develop in response to a medical condition are more
properly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clinically significant
psychological response to an identifiable stressor). There must be
reasonable evidence to suggest an association between the psychological
factors and the medical condition, although it may often not be possible
to demonstrate direct causality or the mechanisms underlying the
relationship.

Prevalence

The prevalence of psychological factors affecting other medical
conditions is unclear. In U.S. private insurance billing data, it is a
more common diagnosis than somatic symptom disorders.

Development and Course

Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions can occur
across the lifespan. Particularly with young children, corroborative
history from parents or school can assist the diagnostic evaluation.
Some conditions are characteristic of particular life stages (e.g., in
older individuals, the stress associated with acting as a caregiver for
an ill spouse or partner).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Many differences between cultures may influence psychological factors
and their effects on medical conditions, such as those in language and
communication style, explanatory models of illness, patterns of seeking
health care, service availability and organization, doctor-patient
relationships and other healing practices, family and gender roles, and
attitudes toward pain and death. Psychological factors affecting other
medical conditions must be differentiated from culturally specific
behaviors such as using faith or spiritual healers or other variations
in illness management that are acceptable within a culture and represent
an attempt to help the medical condition rather than interfere with it.
These local practices may complement rather than obstruct evidence-based
interventions. If they do not adversely affect outcomes, they should not
be pathologized as psychological factors affecting other medical
conditions.

Functional Consequences of Psychological Factors

Affecting Other Medical Conditions

Psychological and behavioral factors have been demonstrated to affect
the course of many medical diseases.

Differential Diagnosis

Mental disorder due to another medical condition.

A temporal association between

symptoms of a mental disorder and those of a medical condition is also
characteristic of a mental disorder due to another medical condition,
but the presumed causality is in the opposite direction. In a mental
disorder due to another medical condition, the medical condition is
judged to be causing the mental disorder through a direct physiological
mechanism. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions,
the psychological or behavioral factors are judged to affect the course
of the medical condition.

Adjustment disorders.

Abnormal psychological or behavioral symptoms that develop in response
to a medical condition are more properly coded as an adjustment disorder
(a clinically significant psychological response to an identifiable
stressor). For example, an indi-

[]{#index_split_029.html#p369}**324**

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

vidual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes enraged
would be diagnosed as having psychological factors affecting other
medical conditions, whereas an individual with angina who developed
maladaptive anticipatory anxiety would be diagnosed as having an
adjustment disorder with anxiety. In clinical practice, however,
psychological factors and a medical condition are often mutually
exacerbating (e.g., anxiety as both a precipitant and a consequence of
angina), in which case the distinction is arbitrary. Other mental
disorders frequently result in medical complications, most notably
substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol use disorder, tobacco use
disorder). If an individual has a coexisting major mental disorder that
adversely affects or causes another medical condition, diagnoses of the
mental disorder and the medical condition are usually sufficient.
Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is diagnosed
when the psychological traits or behaviors do not meet criteria for a
mental diagnosis.

Somatic symptom disorder.

Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by a combination of
distressing somatic symptoms and excessive or maladaptive thoughts,
feelings, and behavior in response to these symptoms or associated
health concerns. The individual may or may not have a diagnosable
medical condition. In contrast, in psychological factors affecting other
medical conditions, the psychological factors adversely affect a medical
condition; the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behavior are not
necessarily excessive.

The difference is one of emphasis, rather than a clear-cut distinction.
In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, the
emphasis is on the exacerbation of the medical condition (e.g., an
individual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes
anxious). In somatic symptom disorder, the emphasis is on maladaptive
thoughts, feelings, and behavior (e.g., an individual with angina who
worries constantly that she will have a heart attack, takes her blood
pressure multiple times per day, and restricts her activities).

Illness anxiety disorder.

Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by high illness anxiety that
is distressing and/or disruptive to daily life with minimal somatic
symptoms. The focus of clinical concern is the individual's worry about
having a disease; in most cases, no serious disease is present. In
psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, anxiety may be
a relevant psychological factor affecting a medical condition, but the
clinical concern is the adverse effects on the medical condition.

Comorbidity

By definition, the diagnosis of psychological factors affecting other
medical conditions entails a relevant psychological or behavioral
syndrome or trait and a comorbid medical condition.

Factitious Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**300.19 (F68.10)**

**Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self**

 

A. Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms, or
induction of injury or disease, associated with identified deception.

B. The individual presents himself or herself to others as ill,
impaired, or injured.

C. The deceptive behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious
external rewards.

D. The behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder, such
as delusional disorder or another psychotic disorder.

*Specify*:

**Single episode**

**Recurrent episodes** (two or more events of falsification of illness
and/or induction of injury)

[]{#index_split_029.html#p370}Factitious Disorder

**325**

**Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another**

**(Previously Factitious Disorder by Proxy)**

 

A. Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms, or
induction of injury or disease, in another, associated with identified
deception.

B. The individual presents another individual (victim) to others as ill,
impaired, or injured.

C. The deceptive behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious
external rewards.

D. The behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder, such
as delusional disorder or another psychotic disorder.

**Note:** The perpetrator, not the victim, receives this diagnosis.

*Specify*:

**Single episode**

**Recurrent episodes** (two or more events of falsification of illness
and/or induction of injury)

Recording Procedures

When an individual falsifies illness in another (e.g., children, adults,
pets), the diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another. The
perpetrator, not the victim, is given the diagnosis. The victim may be
given an abuse diagnosis (e.g., 995.54 \[T74.12X\]; see the chapter

"Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention").

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of factitious disorder is the falsification of
medical or psychological signs and symptoms in oneself or others that
are associated with the identified deception. Individuals with
factitious disorder can also seek treatment for themselves or another
following induction of injury or disease. The diagnosis requires
demonstrating that the individual is taking surreptitious actions to
misrepresent, simulate, or cause signs or symptoms of illness or injury
in the absence of obvious external rewards. Methods of illness
falsification can include exaggeration, fabrication, simulation, and
induction. While a preexisting medical condition may be present, the
deceptive behavior or induction of injury associated with deception
causes others to view such individuals (or another) as more ill or
impaired, and this can lead to excessive clinical intervention.
Individuals with factitious disorder might, for example, report feelings
of depression and suicidality following the death of a spouse despite
the death not being true or the individual's not having a spouse;
deceptively report episodes of neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures,
dizziness, or blacking out); manipulate a laboratory test (e.g., by
adding blood to urine) to falsely indicate an abnormality; falsify
medical records to indicate an illness; ingest a substance (e.g.,
insulin or warfarin) to induce an abnormal laboratory result or illness;
or physically injure themselves or induce illness in themselves or
another (e.g., by injecting fecal material to produce an abscess or to
induce sepsis).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with factitious disorder imposed on self or factitious
disorder imposed on another are at risk for experiencing great
psychological distress or functional impairment by causing harm to
themselves and others. Family, friends, and health care professionals
are also often adversely affected by their behavior. Factitious
disorders have similarities to substance use disorders, eating
disorders, impulse-control disorders, pedophilic disorder, and some
other established disorders related to both the persistence of the
behavior and the intentional efforts to conceal the disordered behavior
through deception. Whereas some aspects of factitious disorders might
represent criminal behavior (e.g., factitious dis-

[]{#index_split_029.html#p371}**326**

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

order imposed on another, in which the parent's actions represent abuse
and maltreatment of a child), such criminal behavior and mental illness
are not mutually exclusive. The diagnosis of factitious disorder
emphasizes the objective identification of falsification of signs and
symptoms of illness, rather than an inference about intent or possible
underlying motivation. Moreover, such behaviors, including the induction
of injury or disease, are associated with deception.

Prevalence

The prevalence of factitious disorder is unknown, likely because of the
role of deception in this population. Among patients in hospital
settings, it is estimated that about 1% of individuals have
presentations that meet the criteria for factitious disorder.

Development and Course

The course of factitious disorder is usually one of intermittent
episodes. Single episodes and episodes that are characterized as
persistent and unremitting are both less common.

Onset is usually in early adulthood, often after hospitalization for a
medical condition or a mental disorder. When imposed on another, the
disorder may begin after hospitalization of the individual's child or
other dependent. In individuals with recurrent episodes of falsification
of signs and symptoms of illness and/or induction of injury, this
pattern of successive deceptive contact with medical personnel,
including hospitalizations, may become lifelong.

Differential Diagnosis

Caregivers who lie about abuse injuries in dependents solely to protect
themselves from liability are not diagnosed with factitious disorder
imposed on another because protection from liability is an external
reward (Criterion C, the deceptive behavior is evident even in the
absence of obvious external rewards). Such caregivers who, upon
observation, analysis of medical records, and/or interviews with others,
are found to lie more extensively than needed for immediate
self-protection are diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on
another.

Somatic symptom disorder.

In somatic symptom disorder, there may be excessive attention and
treatment seeking for perceived medical concerns, but there is no
evidence that the individual is providing false information or behaving
deceptively.

Malingering.

Malingering is differentiated from factitious disorder by the
intentional reporting of symptoms for personal gain (e.g., money, time
off work). In contrast, the diagnosis of factitious disorder requires
the absence of obvious rewards.

Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).

Conversion disorder

is characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with
neurological pathophysiology. Factitious disorder with neurological
symptoms is distinguished from conversion disorder by evidence of
deceptive falsification of symptoms.

Borderline personality disorder.

Deliberate physical self-harm in the absence of suicidal intent can also
occur in association with other mental disorders such as borderline
personality disorder. Factitious disorder requires that the induction of
injury occur in association with deception.

Medical condition or mental disorder not associated with intentional
symptom falsification.

Presentation of signs and symptoms of illness that do not conform to an
identifiable medical condition or mental disorder increases the
likelihood of the presence of a factitious disorder. However, the
diagnosis of factitious disorder does not exclude the presence of true
medical condition or mental disorder, as comorbid illness often occurs
in the individual along with factitious disorder. For example,
individuals who might manipulate blood sugar levels to produce symptoms
may also have diabetes.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p372}Other Specified Somatic Symptom and

Other Specified Somatic Symptom and

Related Disorder

**300.89 (F45.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a somatic symptom and related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other

1\. **Brief somatic symptom disorder:** Duration of symptoms is less
than 6 months.

2\. **Brief illness anxiety disorder:** Duration of symptoms is less
than 6 months.

3\. **Illness anxiety disorder without excessive health-related

situations where there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p373} *This page intentionally left blank*

[]{#index_split_029.html#p374}**Feeding and**

**Eating Disorders**

Feeding and eating disorders are characterized by a persistent
disturbance of eating or eating-related behavior that results in the
altered consumption or absorption of food and that significantly impairs
physical health or psychosocial functioning. Diagnostic criteria are
provided for pica, rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder.

The diagnostic criteria for rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive
food intake disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and
binge-eating disorder result in a classification scheme that is mutually
exclusive, so that during a single episode, only one of these diagnoses
can be assigned. The rationale for this approach is that, despite a
number of common psychological and behavioral features, the disorders
differ substantially in clinical course, outcome, and treatment needs. A
diagnosis of pica, however, may be assigned in the presence of any other
feeding and eating disorder.

Some individuals with disorders described in this chapter report
eating-related symptoms resembling those typically endorsed by
individuals with substance use disorders, such as craving and patterns
of compulsive use. This resemblance may reflect the involvement of the
same neural systems, including those implicated in regulatory
self-control and reward, in both groups of disorders. However, the
relative contributions of shared and distinct factors in the development
and perpetuation of eating and substance use disorders remain
insufficiently understood.

Finally, obesity is not included in DSM-5 as a mental disorder. Obesity
(excess body fat) results from the long-term excess of energy intake
relative to energy expenditure. A range of genetic, physiological,
behavioral, and environmental factors that vary across individuals
contributes to the development of obesity; thus, obesity is not
considered a mental disorder. However, there are robust associations
between obesity and a number of mental disorders (e.g., binge-eating
disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia).

The side effects of some psychotropic medications contribute importantly
to the development of obesity, and obesity may be a risk factor for the
development of some mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders).

Pica

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances over a period
of at least 1 month.

B. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is inappropriate to
the developmental level of the individual.

C. The eating behavior is not part of a culturally supported or socially
normative practice.

D. If the eating behavior occurs in the context of another mental
disorder (e.g., intellectual disability \[intellectual developmental
disorder\], autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) or medical
condition (including pregnancy), it is sufficiently severe to warrant
additional clinical attention.

**329**

[]{#index_split_029.html#p375}**330**

Feeding and Eating Disorders

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for pica is **307.52** and is used
for children or adults.

The ICD-10-CM codes for pica are **(F98.3)** in children and **(F50.8)**
in adults.

*Specify* if:

**In remission:** After full criteria for pica were previously met, the
criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of pica is the eating of one or more nonnutritive,
nonfood substances on a persistent basis over a period of at least 1
month (Criterion A) that is severe enough to warrant clinical attention.
Typical substances ingested tend to vary with age and availability and
might include paper, soap, cloth, hair, string, wool, soil, chalk,
talcum powder, paint, gum, metal, pebbles, charcoal or coal, ash, clay,
starch, or ice. The term *nonfood* is included because the diagnosis of
pica does not apply to ingestion of diet products that have minimal
nutritional content. There is typically no aversion to food in general.
The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances must be developmentally
inappropriate (Criterion B) and not part of a culturally supported or
socially normative practice (Criterion C). A minimum age of 2 years is
suggested for a pica diagnosis to exclude developmentally normal
mouthing of objects by infants that results in ingestion. The eating of
nonnutritive, nonfood substances can be an associated feature of other
mental disorders (e.g., intellectual disability \[intellectual
developmental disorder\], autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia). If
the eating behavior occurs exclusively in the context of another mental
disorder, a separate diagnosis of pica should be made only if the eating
behavior is sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention
(Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Although deficiencies in vitamins or minerals (e.g., zinc, iron) have
been reported in some instances, often no specific biological
abnormalities are found. In some cases, pica comes to clinical attention
only following general medical complications (e.g., mechanical bowel
problems; intestinal obstruction, such as that resulting from a bezoar;
intestinal perforation; infections such as toxoplasmosis and
toxocariasis as a result of ingesting feces or dirt; poisoning, such as
by ingestion of lead-based paint).

Prevalence

The prevalence of pica is unclear. Among individuals with intellectual
disability, the prevalence of pica appears to increase with the severity
of the condition.

Development and Course

Onset of pica can occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood,
although childhood onset is most commonly reported. Pica can occur in
otherwise normally developing children, whereas in adults, it appears
more likely to occur in the context of intellectual disability or other
mental disorders. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may
also manifest in pregnancy, when specific cravings (e.g., chalk or ice)
might occur. The diagnosis of pica during pregnancy is only appropriate
if such cravings lead to the ingestion of nonnutritive, nonfood
substances to the extent that the eating of these substances poses
potential medical risks. The course of the disorder can be protracted
and can result in medical emergencies (e.g., intestinal obstruction,
acute weight loss, poisoning). The disorder can potentially be fatal
depending on substances ingested.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Neglect, lack of supervision, and developmental delay can increase the
risk for this condition.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p376}Pica

**331**

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

In some populations, the eating of earth or other seemingly nonnutritive
substances is believed to be of spiritual, medicinal, or other social
value, or may be a culturally supported or socially normative practice.
Such behavior does not warrant a diagnosis of pica (Criterion C).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Pica occurs in both males and females. It can occur in females during
pregnancy; however, little is known about the course of pica in the
postpartum period.

Diagnostic Markers

Abdominal flat plate radiography, ultrasound, and other scanning methods
may reveal obstructions related to pica. Blood tests and other
laboratory tests can be used to ascertain levels of poisoning or the
nature of infection.

Functional Consequences of Pica

Pica can significantly impair physical functioning, but it is rarely the
sole cause of impairment in social functioning. Pica often occurs with
other disorders associated with impaired social functioning.

Differential Diagnosis

Eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may occur during the course
of other mental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder,
schizophrenia) and in Kleine-Levin syndrome.

In any such instance, an additional diagnosis of pica should be given
only if the eating behavior is sufficiently persistent and severe to
warrant additional clinical attention.

Anorexia nervosa.

Pica can usually be distinguished from the other feeding and eating
disorders by the consumption of nonnutritive, nonfood substances. It is
important to note, however, that some presentations of anorexia nervosa
include ingestion of nonnutritive, nonfood substances, such as paper
tissues, as a means of attempting to control appetite. In such cases,
when the eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is primarily used as
a means of weight control, anorexia nervosa should be the primary
diagnosis.

Factitious disorder.

Some individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally ingest
foreign objects as part of the pattern of falsification of physical
symptoms. In such instances, there is an element of deception that is
consistent with deliberate induction of injury or disease.

Nonsuicidal self-injury and nonsuicidal self-injury behaviors in
personality disorders.

Some individuals may swallow potentially harmful items (e.g., pins,
needles, knives) in the context of maladaptive behavior patterns
associated with personality disorders or nonsuicidal self-injury.

Comorbidity

Disorders most commonly comorbid with pica are autism spectrum disorder
and intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and,
to a lesser degree, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Pica can be associated with trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and
excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. In comorbid presentations, the hair
or skin is typically ingested. Pica can also be associated with
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, particularly in individuals
with a strong sensory component to their presentation. When an
individual is known to have pica, assessment should include
consideration of the possibility of gastrointestinal complications,
poisoning, infection, and nutritional deficiency.

Rumination Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**307.53 (F98.21)**

A. Repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least 1 month.
Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out.

B. The repeated regurgitation is not attributable to an associated
gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e.g., gastroesophageal
reflux, pyloric stenosis).

C. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course
of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.

D. If the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder
(e.g., intellectual disability \[intellectual developmental disorder\]
or another neurodevelopmental disorder), they are sufficiently severe to
warrant additional clinical attention.

*Specify* if:

**In remission:** After full criteria for rumination disorder were
previously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of
time.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of rumination disorder is the repeated
regurgitation of food occurring after feeding or eating over a period of
at least 1 month (Criterion A). Previously swallowed food that may be
partially digested is brought up into the mouth without apparent nausea,
involuntary retching, or disgust. The food may be re-chewed and then
ejected from the mouth or re-swallowed. Regurgitation in rumination
disorder should be frequent, occurring at least several times per week,
typically daily. The behavior is not better explained by an associated
gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e.g., gastroesophageal
reflux, pyloric stenosis) (Criterion B) and does not occur exclusively
during the course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating
disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (Criterion C). If
the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder (e.g.,
intellectual disability \[intellectual developmental disorder\],
neurodevelopmental disorder), they must be sufficiently severe to
warrant additional clinical attention (Criterion D) and should represent
a primary aspect of the individual's presentation requiring
intervention. The disorder may be diagnosed across the life span,
particularly in individuals who also have intellectual disability. Many
individuals with rumination disorder can be directly observed engaging
in the behavior by the clinician. In other instances diagnosis can be
made on the basis of self-report or corroborative information from
parents or caregivers. Individuals may describe the behavior as habitual
or outside of their control.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Infants with rumination disorder display a characteristic position of
straining and arching the back with the head held back, making sucking
movements with their tongue. They may give the impression of gaining
satisfaction from the activity. They may be irritable and hungry between
episodes of regurgitation. Weight loss and failure to make expected
weight gains are common features in infants with rumination disorder.
Malnutrition may occur despite the infant's apparent hunger and the
ingestion of relatively large amounts of food, particularly in severe
cases, when regurgitation immediately follows each feeding episode and
regurgitated food is expelled. Malnutrition might also occur in older
children and adults, particularly when the regurgitation is accompanied
by restriction of intake.

Adolescents and adults may attempt to disguise the regurgitation
behavior by placing a

[]{#index_split_029.html#p378}Rumination Disorder

**333**

hand over the mouth or coughing. Some will avoid eating with others
because of the acknowledged social undesirability of the behavior. This
may extend to an avoidance of eating prior to social situations, such as
work or school (e.g., avoiding breakfast because it may be followed by
regurgitation).

Prevalence

Prevalence data for rumination disorder are inconclusive, but the
disorder is commonly reported to be higher in certain groups, such as
individuals with intellectual disability.

Development and Course

Onset of rumination disorder can occur in infancy, childhood,
adolescence, or adulthood.

The age at onset in infants is usually between ages 3 and 12 months. In
infants, the disorder frequently remits spontaneously, but its course
can be protracted and can result in medical emergencies (e.g., severe
malnutrition). It can potentially be fatal, particularly in infancy.

Rumination disorder can have an episodic course or occur continuously
until treated. In infants, as well as in older individuals with
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or other
neurodevelopmental disorders, the regurgitation and rumination behavior
appears to have a self-soothing or self-stimulating function, similar to
that of other repetitive motor behaviors such as head banging.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Psychosocial problems such as lack of stimulation, neglect, stressful
life situations, and problems in the parent-child relationship may be
predisposing factors in infants and young children.

Functional Consequences of Rumination Disorder

Malnutrition secondary to repeated regurgitation may be associated with
growth delay and have a negative effect on development and learning
potential. Some older individuals with rumination disorder deliberately
restrict their food intake because of the social undesirability of
regurgitation. They may therefore present with weight loss or low
weight.

In older children, adolescents, and adults, social functioning is more
likely to be adversely affected.

Differential Diagnosis

Gastrointestinal conditions.

It is important to differentiate regurgitation in rumination disorder
from other conditions characterized by gastroesophageal reflux or
vomiting. Conditions such as gastroparesis, pyloric stenosis, hiatal
hernia, and Sandifer syndrome in infants should be ruled out by
appropriate physical examinations and laboratory tests.

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

Individuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia

nervosa may also engage in regurgitation with subsequent spitting out of
food as a means of disposing of ingested calories because of concerns
about weight gain.

Comorbidity

Regurgitation with associated rumination can occur in the context of a
concurrent medical condition or another mental disorder (e.g.,
generalized anxiety disorder). When the regurgitation occurs in this
context, a diagnosis of rumination disorder is appropriate only when the
severity of the disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with such
conditions or disorders and warrants additional clinical attention.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p379}**334**

Feeding and Eating Disorders

Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**307.59 (F50.8)**

A. An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in
eating or food; avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food;
concern about aversive consequences of eating) as manifested by
persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs
associated with one (or more) of the following: 1. Significant weight
loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in
children).

2\. Significant nutritional deficiency.

3\. Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements.

4\. Marked interference with psychosocial functioning.

B. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or
by an associated culturally sanctioned practice.

C. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course
of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a
disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is
experienced.

D. The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical
condition or not better explained by another mental disorder. When the
eating disturbance occurs in the context of another condition or
disorder, the severity of the eating disturbance exceeds that routinely
associated with the condition or disorder and warrants additional
clinical attention.

*Specify* if:

**In remission:** After full criteria for avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder were previously met, the criteria have not been met for
a sustained period of time.

Diagnostic Features

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces and extends the
DSM-IV diagnosis of feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. The
main diagnostic feature of avoidant/

restrictive food intake disorder is avoidance or restriction of food
intake (Criterion A) manifested by clinically significant failure to
meet requirements for nutrition or insufficient energy intake through
oral intake of food. One or more of the following key features must be
present: significant weight loss, significant nutritional deficiency (or
related health impact), dependence on enteral feeding or oral
nutritional supplements, or marked interference with psychosocial
functioning. The determination of whether weight loss is significant
(Criterion A1) is a clinical judgment; instead of losing weight,
children and adolescents who have not completed growth may not maintain
weight or height increases along their developmental trajectory.

Determination of significant nutritional deficiency (Criterion A2) is
also based on clinical assessment (e.g., assessment of dietary intake,
physical examination, and laboratory testing), and related impact on
physical health can be of a similar severity to that seen in anorexia
nervosa (e.g., hypothermia, bradycardia, anemia). In severe cases,
particularly in infants, malnutrition can be life threatening.
"Dependence" on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements
(Criterion A3) means that supplementary feeding is required to sustain
adequate intake. Examples of individuals requiring supplementary feeding
include infants with failure to thrive who require nasogastric tube
feeding, children with neurodevelopmental disorders who are dependent on
nutritionally complete supplements, and individuals who rely on
gastrostomy tube feeding or complete oral nutrition supplements in the
absence of an underlying medical condition. Inability to participate in
normal social []{#index_split_029.html#p380}Avoidant/Restrictive Food
Intake Disorder **335**

activities, such as eating with others, or to sustain relationships as a
result of the disturbance would indicate marked interference with
psychosocial functioning (Criterion A4).

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder does not include avoidance or
restriction of food intake related to lack of availability of food or to
cultural practices (e.g., religious fasting or normal dieting)
(Criterion B), nor does it include developmentally normal behaviors
(e.g., picky eating in toddlers, reduced intake in older adults). The
disturbance is not better explained by excessive concern about body
weight or shape (Criterion C) or by concurrent medical factors or mental
disorders (Criterion D).

In some individuals, food avoidance or restriction may be based on the
sensory characteristics of qualities of food, such as extreme
sensitivity to appearance, color, smell, texture, temperature, or taste.
Such behavior has been described as "restrictive eating,"

"selective eating," "choosy eating," "perseverant eating," "chronic food
refusal," and

"food neophobia" and may manifest as refusal to eat particular brands of
foods or to tolerate the smell of food being eaten by others.
Individuals with heightened sensory sensitivities associated with autism
may show similar behaviors.

Food avoidance or restriction may also represent a conditioned negative
response associated with food intake following, or in anticipation of,
an aversive experience, such as choking; a traumatic investigation,
usually involving the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., esoph-agoscopy); or
repeated vomiting. The terms *functional dysphagia* and *globus
hystericus* have also been used for such conditions.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Several features may be associated with food avoidance or reduced food
intake, including a lack of interest in eating or food, leading to
weight loss or faltering growth. Very young infants may present as being
too sleepy, distressed, or agitated to feed. Infants and young children
may not engage with the primary caregiver during feeding or communicate
hunger in favor of other activities. In older children and adolescents,
food avoidance or restriction may be associated with more generalized
emotional difficulties that do not meet diagnostic criteria for an
anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorder, sometimes called "food
avoidance emotional disorder."

Development and Course

Food avoidance or restriction associated with insufficient intake or
lack of interest in eating most commonly develops in infancy or early
childhood and may persist in adulthood.

Likewise, avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food tends to
arise in the first decade of life but may persist into adulthood.
Avoidance related to aversive consequences can arise at any age. The
scant literature regarding long-term outcomes suggests that food
avoidance or restriction based on sensory aspects is relatively stable
and long-standing, but when persisting into adulthood, such
avoidance/restriction can be associated with relatively normal
functioning. There is currently insufficient evidence directly linking
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and subsequent onset of an
eating disorder.

Infants with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder may be irritable
and difficult to console during feeding, or may appear apathetic and
withdrawn. In some instances, parent-child interaction may contribute to
the infant's feeding problem (e.g., presenting food inappropriately, or
interpreting the infant's behavior as an act of aggression or
rejection).

Inadequate nutritional intake may exacerbate the associated features
(e.g., irritability, developmental lags) and further contribute to
feeding difficulties. Associated factors include infant temperament or
developmental impairments that reduce an infant's responsiveness to
feeding. Coexisting parental psychopathology, or child abuse or neglect,
is suggested if feeding and weight improve in response to changing
caregivers. In infants, children, and prepubertal adolescents,
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder may be associated with growth
delay, and the resulting malnutrition negatively affects development and
learning []{#index_split_029.html#p381}**336**

Feeding and Eating Disorders

potential. In older children, adolescents, and adults, social
functioning tends to be adversely affected. Regardless of the age,
family function may be affected, with heightened stress at mealtimes and
in other feeding or eating contexts involving friends and relatives.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder manifests more commonly in
children than in adults, and there may be a long delay between onset and
clinical presentation. Triggers for presentation vary considerably and
include physical, social, and emotional difficulties.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may increase risk
for avoidant or restrictive feeding or eating behavior characteristic of
the disorder.

Environmental.

Environmental risk factors for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
include familial anxiety. Higher rates of feeding disturbances may occur
in children of mothers with eating disorders.

Genetic and physiological.

History of gastrointestinal conditions, gastroesophageal reflux disease,
vomiting, and a range of other medical problems has been associated with
feeding and eating behaviors characteristic of avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Presentations similar to avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder occur
in various populations, including in the United States, Canada,
Australia, and Europe. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should
not be diagnosed when avoidance of food intake is solely related to
specific religious or cultural practices.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is equally common in males and
females in infancy and early childhood, but avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder comorbid with autism spectrum disorder has a male
predominance. Food avoidance or restriction related to altered sensory
sensitivities can occur in some physiological conditions, most notably
pregnancy, but is not usually extreme and does not meet full criteria
for the disorder.

Diagnostic Markers

Diagnostic markers include malnutrition, low weight, growth delay, and
the need for artificial nutrition in the absence of any clear medical
condition other than poor intake.

Functional Consequences of Avoidant/Restrictive

Food Intake Disorder

Associated developmental and functional limitations include impairment
of physical development and social difficulties that can have a
significant negative impact on family function.

Differential Diagnosis

Appetite loss preceding restricted intake is a nonspecific symptom that
can accompany a number of mental diagnoses. Avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder can be diagnosed concurrently with the disorders below
if all criteria are met, and the eating disturbance requires specific
clinical attention.

Other medical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, food allergies
and intolerances, occult malignancies).

Restriction of food intake may occur in other medical condi-

[]{#index_split_029.html#p382}Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder
**337**

tions, especially those with ongoing symptoms such as vomiting, loss of
appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. A diagnosis of
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder requires that the disturbance
of intake is beyond that directly accounted for by physical symptoms
consistent with a medical condition; the eating disturbance may also
persist after being triggered by a medical condition and following
resolution of the medical condition.

Underlying medical or comorbid mental conditions may complicate feeding
and eating.

Because older individuals, postsurgical patients, and individuals
receiving chemotherapy often lose their appetite, an additional
diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder requires that the
eating disturbance is a primary focus for intervention.

Specific neurological/neuromuscular, structural, or congenital disorders
and conditions associated with feeding difficulties.

Feeding difficulties are common in a number

of congenital and neurological conditions often related to problems with
oral/esophageal/

pharyngeal structure and function, such as hypotonia of musculature,
tongue protrusion, and unsafe swallowing. Avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder can be diagnosed in individuals with such presentations
as long as all diagnostic criteria are met.

Reactive attachment disorder.

Some degree of withdrawal is characteristic of reactive attachment
disorder and can lead to a disturbance in the caregiver-child
relationship that can affect feeding and the child's intake.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed
concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and the
feeding disturbance is a primary focus for intervention.

Autism spectrum disorder.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder often present with rigid
eating behaviors and heightened sensory sensitivities. However, these
features do not always result in the level of impairment that would be
required for a diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed
concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when
the eating disturbance requires specific treatment.

Specific phobia, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and other
anxiety disorders.

Specific phobia, other type, specifies "situations that may lead to
choking or vomiting" and can represent the primary trigger for the fear,
anxiety, or avoidance required for diagnosis.

Distinguishing specific phobia from avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder can be difficult when a fear of choking or vomiting has
resulted in food avoidance. Although avoidance or restriction of food
intake secondary to a pronounced fear of choking or vomiting can be
conceptualized as specific phobia, in situations when the eating problem
becomes the primary focus of clinical attention, avoidant/restrictive
food intake disorder becomes the appropriate diagnosis. In social
anxiety disorder, the individual may present with a fear of being
observed by others while eating, which can also occur in
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.

Anorexia nervosa.

Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to
significantly low body weight is a core feature of anorexia nervosa.
However, individuals with anorexia nervosa also display a fear of
gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that
interferes with weight gain, as well as specific disturbances in
relation to perception and experience of their own body weight and
shape. These features are not present in avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder, and the two disorders should not be diagnosed
concurrently. Differential diagnosis between avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder and anorexia nervosa may be difficult, especially in
late childhood and early adolescence, because these disorders may share
a number of common symptoms (e.g., food avoidance, low weight).
Differential diagnosis is also potentially difficult in individuals with
anorexia nervosa who deny any fear of fatness but nonetheless engage in
persistent behaviors that prevent weight gain and who do not recognize
the medical seriousness of their low weight---a presentation sometimes
termed "non-fat phobic anorexia nervosa."

Full consideration of symptoms, course, and family history is advised,
and diagnosis may

[]{#index_split_029.html#p383}**338**

Feeding and Eating Disorders

be best made in the context of a clinical relationship over time. In
some individuals, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder might
precede the onset of anorexia nervosa.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder may

present with avoidance or restriction of intake in relation to
preoccupations with food or ritualized eating behavior.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed
concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when
the aberrant eating is a major aspect of the clinical presentation
requiring specific intervention.

Major depressive disorder.

In major depressive disorder, appetite might be affected to such an
extent that individuals present with significantly restricted food
intake, usually in relation to overall energy intake and often
associated with weight loss. Usually appetite loss and related reduction
of intake abate with resolution of mood problems. Avoidant/

restrictive food intake disorder should only be used concurrently if
full criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating disturbance
requires specific treatment.

Schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

Individuals with schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other psychotic
disorders may exhibit odd eating behaviors, avoidance of specific foods
because of delusional beliefs, or other manifestations of avoidant or
restrictive intake. In some cases, delusional beliefs may contribute to
a concern about negative consequences of ingesting certain foods.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be used concurrently
only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating
disturbance requires specific treatment.

Factitious disorder or factitious disorder imposed on another.

Avoidant/restrictive

food intake disorder should be differentiated from factitious disorder
or factitious disorder imposed on another. In order to assume the sick
role, some individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally
describe diets that are much more restrictive than those they are
actually able to consume, as well as complications of such behavior,
such as a need for enteral feedings or nutritional supplements, an
inability to tolerate a normal range of foods, and/or an inability to
participate normally in age-appropriate situations involving food. The
presentation may be impressively dramatic and engaging, and the symptoms
reported inconsistently. In factitious disorder imposed on another, the
caregiver describes symptoms consistent with avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder and may induce physical symptoms such as failure to gain
weight. As with any diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on another,
the caregiver receives the diagnosis rather than the affected
individual, and diagnosis should be made only on the basis of a careful,
comprehensive assessment of the affected individual, the caregiver, and
their interaction.

Comorbidity

The most commonly observed disorders comorbid with avoidant/restrictive
food intake disorder are anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorders (specifically autism spectrum
disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual
disability \[intellectual developmental disorder\]).

Anorexia Nervosa

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a
significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental
trajectory, and physical health. *Significantly low weight* is defined
as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and
adolescents, less than that minimally expected.

B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent
behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a
significantly low weight.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p384}Anorexia Nervosa

**339**

C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is
experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation,
or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low
body weight.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for anorexia nervosa is **307.1,**
which is assigned regardless of the subtype. The ICD-10-CM code depends
on the subtype (see below).

*Specify* whether:

**(F50.01) Restricting type:** During the last 3 months, the individual
has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging
behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives,
diuretics, or enemas). This subtype describes presentations in which
weight loss is accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting, and/or
excessive exercise.

(**F50.02) Binge-eating/purging type:** During the last 3 months, the
individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging
behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives,
diuretics, or enemas).

*Specify* if:

**In partial remission:** After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were
previously met, Criterion A (low body weight) has not been met for a
sustained period, but either Criterion B (intense fear of gaining weight
or becoming fat or behavior that interferes with weight gain) or
Criterion C (disturbances in self-perception of weight and shape) is
still met.

**In full remission:** After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were
previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sustained
period of time.

*Specify* current severity:

The minimum level of severity is based, for adults, on current body mass
index (BMI) (see below) or, for children and adolescents, on BMI
percentile. The ranges below are derived from World Health Organization
categories for thinness in adults; for children and adolescents,
corresponding BMI percentiles should be used. The level of severity may
be increased to reflect clinical symptoms, the degree of functional
disability, and the need for supervision.

**Mild:** BMI ≥ 17 kg/m2

**Moderate:** BMI 16--16.99 kg/m2

**Severe:** BMI 15--15.99 kg/m2

**Extreme:** BMI \< 15 kg/m2

Subtypes

Most individuals with the binge-eating/purging type of anorexia nervosa
who binge eat also purge through self-induced vomiting or the misuse of
laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.

Some individuals with this subtype of anorexia nervosa do not binge eat
but do regularly purge after the consumption of small amounts of food.

Crossover between the subtypes over the course of the disorder is not
uncommon; therefore, subtype description should be used to describe
current symptoms rather than longitudinal course.

Diagnostic Features

There are three essential features of anorexia nervosa: persistent
energy intake restriction; intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming
fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain; and a
disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape. The individual maintains
a body weight that is below a minimally normal level for age, sex,
developmental trajectory, and physical health (Criterion A).
Individuals' body weights frequently meet this criterion following a
significant weight loss, but among children and adolescents, there may
alternatively be failure to make expected weight gain or to maintain a
normal developmental trajectory (i.e., while growing in height) instead
of weight loss.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p385}**340**

Feeding and Eating Disorders

Criterion A requires that the individual's weight be significantly low
(i.e., less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less
than that minimally expected).

Weight assessment can be challenging because normal weight range differs
among individuals, and different thresholds have been published defining
thinness or underweight status. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as
weight in kilograms/height in meters2) is a useful measure to assess
body weight for height. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 kg/m2 has been
employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
World Health Organization (WHO) as the lower limit of normal body
weight. Therefore, most adults with a BMI greater than or equal to 18.5
kg/m2 would not be considered to have a significantly low body weight.
On the other hand, a BMI of lower than 17.0 kg/m2 has been considered by
the WHO to indicate moderate or severe thinness; therefore, an
individual with a BMI less than 17.0 kg/m2 would likely be considered to
have a significantly low weight. An adult with a BMI between 17.0 and
18.5 kg/m2, or even above 18.5 kg/m2, might be considered to have a
significantly low weight if clinical history or other physiological
information supports this judgment.

For children and adolescents, determining a BMI-for-age percentile is
useful (see, e.g., the CDC BMI percentile calculator for children and
teenagers. As for adults, it is not possible to provide definitive
standards for judging whether a child's or an adolescent's weight is
significantly low, and variations in developmental trajectories among
youth limit the utility of simple numerical guidelines. The CDC has used
a BMI-for-age below the 5th percentile as suggesting underweight;
however, children and adolescents with a BMI above this benchmark may be
judged to be significantly underweight in light of failure to maintain
their expected growth trajectory. In summary, in determining whether
Criterion A is met, the clinician should consider available numerical
guidelines, as well as the individual's body build, weight history, and
any physiological disturbances.

Individuals with this disorder typically display an intense fear of
gaining weight or of becoming fat (Criterion B). This intense fear of
becoming fat is usually not alleviated by weight loss. In fact, concern
about weight gain may increase even as weight falls. Younger individuals
with anorexia nervosa, as well as some adults, may not recognize or
acknowledge a fear of weight gain. In the absence of another explanation
for the significantly low weight, clinician inference drawn from
collateral history, observational data, physical and laboratory
findings, or longitudinal course either indicating a fear of weight gain
or supporting persistent behaviors that prevent it may be used to
establish Criterion B.

The experience and significance of body weight and shape are distorted
in these individuals (Criterion C). Some individuals feel globally
overweight. Others realize that they are thin but are still concerned
that certain body parts, particularly the abdomen, buttocks, and thighs,
are "too fat." They may employ a variety of techniques to evaluate their
body size or weight, including frequent weighing, obsessive measuring of
body parts, and persistent use of a mirror to check for perceived areas
of "fat." The self-esteem of individuals with anorexia nervosa is highly
dependent on their perceptions of body shape and weight.

Weight loss is often viewed as an impressive achievement and a sign of
extraordinary self-discipline, whereas weight gain is perceived as an
unacceptable failure of self-control. Although some individuals with
this disorder may acknowledge being thin, they often do not recognize
the serious medical implications of their malnourished state.

Often, the individual is brought to professional attention by family
members after marked weight loss (or failure to make expected weight
gains) has occurred. If individuals seek help on their own, it is
usually because of distress over the somatic and psychological sequelae
of starvation. It is rare for an individual with anorexia nervosa to
complain of weight loss per se. In fact, individuals with anorexia
nervosa frequently either lack insight into or deny the problem. It is
therefore often important to obtain information from family members or
other sources to evaluate the history of weight loss and other features
of the illness.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The semi-starvation of anorexia nervosa, and the purging behaviors
sometimes associated with it, can result in significant and potentially
life-threatening medical conditions. The nutritional compromise
associated with this disorder affects most major organ systems and can
produce a variety of disturbances. Physiological disturbances, including
amenorrhea and vital sign abnormalities, are common. While most of the
physiological disturbances associated with malnutrition are reversible
with nutritional rehabilitation, some, including loss of bone mineral
density, are often not completely reversible. Behaviors such as
self-induced vomiting and misuse of laxatives, diuretics, and enemas may
cause a number of disturbances that lead to abnormal laboratory
findings; however, some individuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit no
laboratory abnormalities.

When seriously underweight, many individuals with anorexia nervosa have
depressive signs and symptoms such as depressed mood, social withdrawal,
irritability, insomnia, and diminished interest in sex. Because these
features are also observed in individuals without anorexia nervosa who
are significantly undernourished, many of the depressive features may be
secondary to the physiological sequelae of semi-starvation, although
they may also be sufficiently severe to warrant an additional diagnosis
of major depressive disorder.

Obsessive-compulsive features, both related and unrelated to food, are
often prominent.

Most individuals with anorexia nervosa are preoccupied with thoughts of
food. Some collect recipes or hoard food. Observations of behaviors
associated with other forms of starvation suggest that obsessions and
compulsions related to food may be exacerbated by undernutrition. When
individuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit obsessions and compulsions
that are not related to food, body shape, or weight, an additional
diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be warranted.

Other features sometimes associated with anorexia nervosa include
concerns about eating in public, feelings of ineffectiveness, a strong
desire to control one's environment, inflexible thinking, limited social
spontaneity, and overly restrained emotional expression. Compared with
individuals with anorexia nervosa, restricting type, those with
binge-eating/purging type have higher rates of impulsivity and are more
likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs.

A subgroup of individuals with anorexia nervosa show excessive levels of
physical activity. Increases in physical activity often precede onset of
the disorder, and over the course of the disorder increased activity
accelerates weight loss. During treatment, excessive activity may be
difficult to control, thereby jeopardizing weight recovery.

Individuals with anorexia nervosa may misuse medications, such as by
manipulating dosage, in order to achieve weight loss or avoid weight
gain. Individuals with diabetes mellitus may omit or reduce insulin
doses in order to minimize carbohydrate metabolism.

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalence of anorexia nervosa among young females is
approximately 0.4%. Less is known about prevalence among males, but
anorexia nervosa is far less common in males than in females, with
clinical populations generally reflecting approximately a 10:1
female-to-male ratio.

Development and Course

Anorexia nervosa commonly begins during adolescence or young adulthood.
It rarely begins before puberty or after age 40, but cases of both early
and late onset have been described. The onset of this disorder is often
associated with a stressful life event, such as leaving home for
college. The course and outcome of anorexia nervosa are highly variable.

Younger individuals may manifest atypical features, including denying
"fear of fat." Older

[]{#index_split_029.html#p387}**342**

Feeding and Eating Disorders

individuals more likely have a longer duration of illness, and their
clinical presentation may include more signs and symptoms of
long-standing disorder. Clinicians should not exclude anorexia nervosa
from the differential diagnosis solely on the basis of older age.

Many individuals have a period of changed eating behavior prior to full
criteria for the disorder being met. Some individuals with anorexia
nervosa recover fully after a single episode, with some exhibiting a
fluctuating pattern of weight gain followed by relapse, and others
experiencing a chronic course over many years. Hospitalization may be
required to restore weight and to address medical complications. Most
individuals with anorexia nervosa experience remission within 5 years of
presentation. Among individuals admitted to hospitals, overall remission
rates may be lower. The crude mortality rate (CMR) for anorexia nervosa
is approximately 5% per decade. Death most commonly results from medical
complications associated with the disorder itself or from suicide.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Individuals who develop anxiety disorders or display obsessional traits
in childhood are at increased risk of developing anorexia nervosa.

Environmental.

Historical and cross-cultural variability in the prevalence of anorexia
nervosa supports its association with cultures and settings in which
thinness is valued. Occupations and avocations that encourage thinness,
such as modeling and elite athletics, are also associated with increased
risk.

Genetic and physiological.

There is an increased risk of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa among
first-degree biological relatives of individuals with the disorder. An
increased risk of bipolar and depressive disorders has also been found
among first-degree relatives of individuals with anorexia nervosa,
particularly relatives of individuals with the binge-eating/purging
type. Concordance rates for anorexia nervosa in monozygotic twins are
significantly higher than those for dizygotic twins. A range of brain
abnormalities has been described in anorexia nervosa using functional
imaging technologies (functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron
emission tomography). The degree to which these findings reflect changes
associated with malnutrition versus primary abnormalities associated
with the disorder is unclear.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Anorexia nervosa occurs across culturally and socially diverse
populations, although available evidence suggests cross-cultural
variation in its occurrence and presentation. Anorexia nervosa is
probably most prevalent in post-industrialized, high-income countries
such as in the United States, many European countries, Australia, New
Zealand, and Japan, but its incidence in most low-and middle-income
countries is uncertain. Whereas the prevalence of anorexia nervosa
appears comparatively low among Latinos, African Americans, and Asians
in the United States, clinicians should be aware that mental health
service utilization among individuals with an eating disorder is
significantly lower in these ethnic groups and that the low rates may
reflect an ascertainment bias. The presentation of weight concerns among
individuals with eating and feeding disorders varies substantially
across cultural contexts. The absence of an expressed intense fear of
weight gain, sometimes referred to as "fat phobia," appears to be
relatively more common in populations in Asia, where the rationale for
dietary restriction is commonly related to a more culturally sanctioned
complaint such as gastrointestinal discomfort. Within the United States,
presentations without a stated intense fear of weight gain may be
comparatively more common among Latino groups.

Diagnostic Markers

The following laboratory abnormalities may be observed in anorexia
nervosa; their presence may serve to increase diagnostic confidence.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p388}Anorexia Nervosa

**343**

Hematology.

Leukopenia is common, with the loss of all cell types but usually with
apparent lymphocytosis. Mild anemia can occur, as well as
thrombocytopenia and, rarely, bleeding problems.

Serum chemistry.

Dehydration may be reflected by an elevated blood urea nitrogen level.
Hypercholesterolemia is common. Hepatic enzyme levels may be elevated.
Hypo-magnesemia, hypozincemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperamylasemia are
occasionally observed. Self-induced vomiting may lead to metabolic
alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate), hypochloremia, and hypokalemia;
laxative abuse may cause a mild metabolic acidosis.

Endocrine.

Serum thyroxine (T4) levels are usually in the low-normal range;
triiodothy-ronine (T3) levels are decreased, while reverse T3 levels are
elevated. Females have low serum estrogen levels, whereas males have low
levels of serum testosterone.

Electrocardiography.

Sinus bradycardia is common, and, rarely, arrhythmias are noted.

Significant prolongation of the QTc interval is observed in some
individuals.

Bone mass.

Low bone mineral density, with specific areas of osteopenia or
osteoporosis, is often seen. The risk of fracture is significantly
elevated.

Electroencephalography.

Diffuse abnormalities, reflecting a metabolic encephalopathy, may result
from significant fluid and electrolyte disturbances.

Resting energy expenditure.

There is often a significant reduction in resting energy expenditure.

Physical signs and symptoms.

Many of the physical signs and symptoms of anorexia

nervosa are attributable to starvation. Amenorrhea is commonly present
and appears to be an indicator of physiological dysfunction. If present,
amenorrhea is usually a consequence of the weight loss, but in a
minority of individuals it may actually precede the weight loss. In
prepubertal females, menarche may be delayed. In addition to amenorrhea,
there may be complaints of constipation, abdominal pain, cold
intolerance, lethargy, and excess energy.

The most remarkable finding on physical examination is emaciation.
Commonly, there is also significant hypotension, hypothermia, and
bradycardia. Some individuals develop lanugo, a fine downy body hair.
Some develop peripheral edema, especially during weight restoration or
upon cessation of laxative and diuretic abuse. Rarely, petechiae or
ecchymoses, usually on the extremities, may indicate a bleeding
diathesis. Some individuals evidence a yellowing of the skin associated
with hypercarotenemia. As may be seen in individuals with bulimia
nervosa, individuals with anorexia nervosa who self-induce vomiting may
have hypertrophy of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid
glands, as well as dental enamel erosion. Some individuals may have
scars or calluses on the dorsal surface of the hand from repeated
contact with the teeth while inducing vomiting.

Suicide Risk

Suicide risk is elevated in anorexia nervosa, with rates reported as 12
per 100,000 per year.

Comprehensive evaluation of individuals with anorexia nervosa should
include assessment of suicide-related ideation and behaviors as well as
other risk factors for suicide, including a history of suicide
attempt(s).

Functional Consequences of Anorexia Nervosa

Individuals with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a range of functional
limitations associated with the disorder. While some individuals remain
active in social and professional functioning, others demonstrate
significant social isolation and/or failure to fulfill academic or
career potential.

[]{#index_split_029.html#p389}**344**

Feeding and Eating Disorders

Differential Diagnosis

Other possible causes of either significantly low body weight or
significant weight loss should be considered in the differential
diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, especially when the presenting features
are atypical (e.g., onset after age 40 years).

Medical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, hyperthyroidism,
occult malignancies, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \[AIDS\]).

Serious weight loss may occur in medical conditions, but individuals
with these disorders usually do not also manifest a disturbance in the
way their body weight or shape is experienced or an intense fear of
weight gain or persist in behaviors that interfere with appropriate
weight gain. Acute weight loss associated with a medical condition can
occasionally be followed by the onset or recurrence of anorexia nervosa,
which can initially be masked by the comorbid medical condition. Rarely,
anorexia nervosa develops after bariatric surgery for obesity.

Major depressive disorder.

In major depressive disorder, severe weight loss may occur, but most
individuals with major depressive disorder do not have either a desire
for excessive weight loss or an intense fear of gaining weight.

Schizophrenia.

Individuals with schizophrenia may exhibit odd eating behavior and
occasionally experience significant weight loss, but they rarely show
the fear of gaining weight and the body image disturbance required for a
diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.

Substance use disorders.

Individuals with substance use disorders may experience low weight due
to poor nutritional intake but generally do not fear gaining weight and
do not manifest body image disturbance. Individuals who abuse substances
that reduce appetite (e.g., cocaine, stimulants) and who also endorse
fear of weight gain should be carefully evaluated for the possibility of
comorbid anorexia nervosa, given that the substance use may represent a
persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain (Criterion B).

Social anxiety disorder (social phobia), obsessive-compulsive disorder,
and body dysmorphic disorder.

Some of the features of anorexia nervosa overlap with the criteria for
social phobia, OCD, and body dysmorphic disorder. Specifically,
individuals may feel humiliated or embarrassed to be seen eating in
public, as in social phobia; may exhibit obsessions and compulsions
related to food, as in OCD; or may be preoccupied with an imagined
defect in bodily appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder. If the
individual with anorexia nervosa has social fears that are limited to
eating behavior alone, the diagnosis of social phobia should not be
made, but social fears unrelated to eating behavior (e.g., excessive
fear of speaking in public) may warrant an additional diagnosis of
social phobia. Similarly, an additional diagnosis of OCD should be
considered only if the individual exhibits obsessions and compulsions
unrelated to food (e.g., an excessive fear of contamination), and an
additional diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder should be considered
only if the distortion is unrelated to body shape and size (e.g.,
preoccupation that one's nose is too big).

Bulimia nervosa.

Individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit recurrent episodes of binge
eating, engage in inappropriate behavior to avoid weight gain (e.g.,
self-induced vomiting), and are overly concerned with body shape and
weight. However, unlike individuals with anorexia nervosa,
binge-eating/purging type, individuals with bulimia nervosa maintain
body weight at or above a minimally normal level.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.

Individuals with this disorder may exhibit

significant weight loss or significant nutritional deficiency, but they
do not have a fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, nor do they
have a disturbance in the way they experience their body shape and
weight.

Comorbidity

Bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with
anorexia nervosa.

Many individuals with anorexia nervosa report the presence of either an
anxiety disorder

[]{#index_split_029.html#p390}Bulimia Nervosa

**345**

or symptoms prior to onset of their eating disorder. OCD is described in
some individuals with anorexia nervosa, especially those with the
restricting type. Alcohol use disorder and other substance use disorders
may also be comorbid with anorexia nervosa, especially among those with
the binge-eating/purging type.

Bulimia Nervosa

Diagnostic Criteria

**307.51 (F50.2)**

A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is
characterized by both of the following:

1\. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour
period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most
individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar
circumstances.

2\. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a
feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is
eating).

B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent
weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives,
diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.

C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur,
on average, at least once a week for 3 months.

D. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.

E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of
anorexia nervosa.

*Specify* if:

**In partial remission:** After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were
previously met, some, but not all, of the criteria have been met for a
sustained period of time.

**In full remission:** After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were
previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sustained
period of time.

*Specify* current severity:

The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of inappropriate
compensatory behaviors (see below). The level of severity may be
increased to reflect other symptoms and the degree of functional
disability.

[]{#index_split_030.html}

**Mild:** An average of 1--3 episodes of inappropriate compensatory
behaviors per week.

**Moderate:** An average of 4--7 episodes of inappropriate compensatory
behaviors per week.

**Severe:** An average of 8--13 episodes of inappropriate compensatory
behaviors per week.

**Extreme:** An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate
compensatory behaviors per week.

Diagnostic Features

There are three essential features of bulimia nervosa: recurrent
episodes of binge eating (Criterion A), recurrent inappropriate
compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain (Criterion B), and
self-evaluation that is unduly influenced by body shape and weight
(Criterion D). To qualify for the diagnosis, the binge eating and
inappropriate compensatory behaviors must occur, on average, at least
once per week for 3 months (Criterion C).

An "episode of binge eating" is defined as eating, in a discrete period
of time, an amount of food that is definitely larger than most
individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar
circumstances (Criterion A1). The context in which the eating occurs

[]{#index_split_030.html#p391}**346**

Feeding and Eating Disorders

may affect the clinician's estimation of whether the intake is
excessive. For example, a quantity of food that might be regarded as
excessive for a typical meal might be considered normal during a
celebration or holiday meal. A "discrete period of time" refers to a
limited period, usually less than 2 hours. A single episode of binge
eating need not be restricted to one setting. For example, an individual
may begin a binge in a restaurant and then continue to eat on returning
home. Continual snacking on small amounts of food throughout the day
would not be considered an eating binge.

An occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a
sense of lack of control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of
binge eating. An indicator of loss of control is the inability to
refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some individuals
describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating
episodes. The impairment in control associated with binge eating may not
be absolute; for example, an individual may continue binge eating while
the telephone is ringing but will cease if a roommate or spouse
unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report that their
binge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of
loss of control but rather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled
eating. If individuals report that they have abandoned efforts to
control their eating, loss of control should be considered as present.
Binge eating can also be planned in some instances.

The type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals
and for a given individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized
more by an abnormality in the amount of food consumed than by a craving
for a specific nutrient. However, during binges, individuals tend to eat
foods they would otherwise avoid.

Individuals with bulimia nervosa are typically ashamed of their eating
problems and attempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually
occurs in secrecy or as inconspic-uously as possible. The binge eating
often continues until the individual is uncomfortably, or even
painfully, full. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative
affect.

Other triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint;
negative feelings related to body weight, body shape, and food; and
boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mitigate factors that precipitated
the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation and
dysphoria often are the delayed consequences.

Another essential feature of bulimia nervosa is the recurrent use of
inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain,
collectively referred to as *purge behaviors* or *purging* (Criterion
B). Many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ several methods to
compensate for binge eating. Vomiting is the most common inappropriate
compensatory behavior. The immediate effects of vomiting include relief
from physical discomfort and reduction of fear of gaining weight. In
some cases, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the individual will
binge eat in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of
food.

Individuals with bulimia nervosa may use a variety of methods to induce
vomiting, including the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the
gag reflex. Individuals generally become adept at inducing vomiting and
are eventually able to vomit at will. Rarely, individuals consume syrup
of ipecac to induce vomiting. Other purging behaviors include the misuse
of laxatives and diuretics. A number of other compensatory methods may
also be used in rare cases. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may misuse
enemas following episodes of binge eating, but this is seldom the sole
compensatory method employed. Individuals with this disorder may take
thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain.

Individuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia nervosa may omit or
reduce insulin doses in order to reduce the metabolism of food consumed
during eating binges. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may fast for a
day or more or exercise excessively in an attempt to prevent weight
gain. Exercise may be considered excessive when it significantly
interferes with important activities, when it occurs at inappropriate
times or in inappropriate settings, or when the individual continues to
exercise despite injury or other medical complications.

Individuals with bulimia nervosa place an excessive emphasis on body
shape or weight in their self-evaluation, and these factors are
typically extremely important in determining

[]{#index_split_030.html#p392}Bulimia Nervosa

**347**

self-esteem (Criterion D). Individuals with this disorder may closely
resemble those with anorexia nervosa in their fear of gaining weight, in
their desire to lose weight, and in the level of dissatisfaction with
their bodies. However, a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should not be
given when the disturbance occurs only during episodes of anorexia
nervosa (Criterion E).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with bulimia nervosa typically are within the normal weight
or overweight range (body mass index \[BMI\] ≥ 18.5 and \< 30 in
adults). The disorder occurs but is uncommon among obese individuals.
Between eating binges, individuals with bulimia nervosa typically
restrict their total caloric consumption and preferentially select
low-calorie ("diet") foods while avoiding foods that they perceive to be
fattening or likely to trigger a binge.

Menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea often occurs among females with
bulimia nervosa; it is uncertain whether such disturbances are related
to weight fluctuations, to nutritional deficiencies, or to emotional
distress. The fluid and electrolyte disturbances resulting from the
purging behavior are sometimes sufficiently severe to constitute
medically serious problems. Rare but potentially fatal complications
include esophageal tears, gastric rupture, and cardiac arrhythmias.
Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported among
individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce
vomiting. Individuals who chronically abuse laxatives may become
dependent on their use to stimulate bowel movements. Gastrointestinal
symptoms are commonly associated with bulimia nervosa, and rectal
prolapse has also been reported among individuals with this disorder.

Prevalence

Twelve-month prevalence of bulimia nervosa among young females is
1%--1.5%. Point prevalence is highest among young adults since the
disorder peaks in older adolescence and young adulthood. Less is known
about the point prevalence of bulimia nervosa in males, but bulimia
nervosa is far less common in males than it is in females, with an
approximately 10:1 female-to-male ratio.

Development and Course

Bulimia nervosa commonly begins in adolescence or young adulthood. Onset
before puberty or after age 40 is uncommon. The binge eating frequently
begins during or after an episode of dieting to lose weight.
Experiencing multiple stressful life events also can precipitate onset
of bulimia nervosa.

Disturbed eating behavior persists for at least several years in a high
percentage of clinic samples. The course may be chronic or intermittent,
with periods of remission alternating with recurrences of binge eating.
However, over longer-term follow-up, the symptoms of many individuals
appear to diminish with or without treatment, although treatment clearly
impacts outcome. Periods of remission longer than 1 year are associated
with better long-term outcome.

Significantly elevated risk for mortality (all-cause and suicide) has
been reported for individuals with bulimia nervosa. The CMR (crude
mortality rate) for bulimia nervosa is nearly 2% per decade.

Diagnostic cross-over from initial bulimia nervosa to anorexia nervosa
occurs in a minority of cases (10%--15%). Individuals who do experience
cross-over to anorexia nervosa commonly will revert back to bulimia
nervosa or have multiple occurrences of cross-overs between these
disorders. A subset of individuals with bulimia nervosa continue to
binge eat but no longer engage in inappropriate compensatory behaviors,
and therefore their []{#index_split_030.html#p393}**348**

Feeding and Eating Disorders

symptoms meet criteria for binge-eating disorder or other specified
eating disorder. Diagnosis should be based on the current (i.e., past 3
months) clinical presentation.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Weight concerns, low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, social anxiety
disorder, and overanxious disorder of childhood are associated with
increased risk for the development of bulimia nervosa.

Environmental.

Internalization of a thin body ideal has been found to increase risk for
developing weight concerns, which in turn increase risk for the
development of bulimia nervosa. Individuals who experienced childhood
sexual or physical abuse are at increased risk for developing bulimia
nervosa.

Genetic and physiological.

Childhood obesity and early pubertal maturation increase risk for
bulimia nervosa. Familial transmission of bulimia nervosa may be
present, as well as genetic vulnerabilities for the disorder.

Course modifiers.

Severity of psychiatric comorbidity predicts worse long-term outcome of
bulimia nervosa.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Bulimia nervosa has been reported to occur with roughly similar
frequencies in most industrialized countries, including the United
States, Canada, many European countries, Australia, Japan, New Zealand,
and South Africa. In clinical studies of bulimia nervosa in the United
States, individuals presenting with this disorder are primarily white.
However, the disorder also occurs in other ethnic groups and with
prevalence comparable to estimated prevalences observed in white
samples.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Bulimia nervosa is far more common in females than in males. Males are
especially under-represented in treatment-seeking samples, for reasons
that have not yet been systematically examined.

Diagnostic Markers

No specific diagnostic test for bulimia nervosa currently exists.
However, several laboratory abnormalities may occur as a consequence of
purging and may increase diagnostic certainty. These include fluid and
electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia (which can provoke
cardiac arrhythmias), hypochloremia, and hyponatremia. The loss of
gastric acid through vomiting may produce a metabolic alkalosis
(elevated serum bicarbonate), and the frequent induction of diarrhea or
dehydration through laxative and diuretic abuse can cause metabolic
acidosis. Some individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit mildly elevated
levels of serum amylase, probably reflecting an increase in the salivary
isoenzyme.

Physical examination usually yields no physical findings. However,
inspection of the mouth may reveal significant and permanent loss of
dental enamel, especially from lingual surfaces of the front teeth due
to recurrent vomiting. These teeth may become chipped and appear ragged
and "moth-eaten." There may also be an increased frequency of dental
caries. In some individuals, the salivary glands, particularly the
parotid glands, may become notably enlarged. Individuals who induce
vomiting by manually stimulating the gag reflex may develop calluses or
scars on the dorsal surface of the hand from repeated contact with the
teeth. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported among
individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce
vomiting.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p394}Bulimia Nervosa

**349**

Suicide Risk

Suicide risk is elevated in bulimia nervosa. Comprehensive evaluation of
individuals with this disorder should include assessment of
suicide-related ideation and behaviors as well as other risk factors for
suicide, including a history of suicide attempts.

Functional Consequences of Bulimia Nervosa

Individuals with bulimia nervosa may exhibit a range of functional
limitations associated with the disorder. A minority of individuals
report severe role impairment, with the social-life domain most likely
to be adversely affected by bulimia nervosa.

Differential Diagnosis

Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type.

Individuals whose binge-eating behavior occurs only during episodes of
anorexia nervosa are given the diagnosis anorexia nervosa,
binge-eating/purging type, and should not be given the additional
diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. For individuals with an initial diagnosis
of anorexia nervosa who binge and purge but whose presentation no longer
meets the full criteria for anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type
(e.g., when weight is normal), a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should be
given only when all criteria for bulimia nervosa have been met for at
least 3 months.

Binge-eating disorder.

Some individuals binge eat but do not engage in regular inappropriate
compensatory behaviors. In these cases, the diagnosis of binge-eating
disorder should be considered.

Kleine-Levin syndrome.

In certain neurological or other medical conditions, such as
Kleine-Levin syndrome, there is disturbed eating behavior, but the
characteristic psychological features of bulimia nervosa, such as
overconcern with body shape and weight, are not present.

Major depressive disorder, with atypical features.

Overeating is common in major depressive disorder, with atypical
features, but individuals with this disorder do not engage in
inappropriate compensatory behaviors and do not exhibit the excessive
concern with body shape and weight characteristic of bulimia nervosa. If
criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given.

Borderline personality disorder.

Binge-eating behavior is included in the impulsive behavior criterion
that is part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If
the criteria for both borderline personality disorder and bulimia
nervosa are met, both diagnoses should be given.

Comorbidity

Comorbidity with mental disorders is common in individuals with bulimia
nervosa, with most experiencing at least one other mental disorder and
many experiencing multiple comorbidities. Comorbidity is not limited to
any particular subset but rather occurs across a wide range of mental
disorders. There is an increased frequency of depressive symptoms (e.g.,
low self-esteem) and bipolar and depressive disorders (particularly
depressive disorders) in individuals with bulimia nervosa. In many
individuals, the mood disturbance begins at the same time as or
following the development of bulimia nervosa, and individuals often
ascribe their mood disturbances to the bulimia nervosa. However, in some
individuals, the mood disturbance clearly precedes the development of
bulimia nervosa.

There may also be an increased frequency of anxiety symptoms (e.g., fear
of social situations) or anxiety disorders. These mood and anxiety
disturbances frequently remit follow-

Feeding and Eating Disorders

ing effective treatment of the bulimia nervosa. The lifetime prevalence
of substance use, particularly alcohol or stimulant use, is at least 30%
among individuals with bulimia nervosa. Stimulant use often begins in an
attempt to control appetite and weight. A substantial percentage of
individuals with bulimia nervosa also have personality features that
meet criteria for one or more personality disorders, most frequently
borderline personality disorder.

Binge-Eating Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**307.51 (F50.8)**

A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is
characterized by both of the following:

1\. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour
period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most
people would eat in a similar period of time under similar
circumstances.

2\. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a
feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is
eating).

B. The binge-eating episodes are associated with three (or more) of the
following: 1. Eating much more rapidly than normal.

2\. Eating until feeling uncomfortably full.

3\. Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry.

4\. Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is
eating.

5\. Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward.

C. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present.

D. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3
months.

E. The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of
inappropriate compensatory behavior as in bulimia nervosa and does not
occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia
nervosa.

*Specify* if:

**In partial remission:** After full criteria for binge-eating disorder
were previously met, binge eating occurs at an average frequency of less
than one episode per week for a sustained period of time.

**In full remission:** After full criteria for binge-eating disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sustained
period of time.

*Specify* current severity:

The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of episodes of
binge eating (see below). The level of severity may be increased to
reflect other symptoms and the degree of functional disability.

**Mild:** 1--3 binge-eating episodes per week.

**Moderate:** 4--7 binge-eating episodes per week.

**Severe:** 8--13 binge-eating episodes per week.

**Extreme:** 14 or more binge-eating episodes per week.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of binge-eating disorder is recurrent episodes of
binge eating that must occur, on average, at least once per week for 3
months (Criterion D). An "episode of binge eating" is defined as eating,
in a discrete period of time, an amount of food that is defi-

nitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time
under similar circumstances (Criterion A1). The context in which the

intake is excessive. For example, a quantity of food that might be
regarded as excessive for a typical meal might be considered normal
during a celebration or holiday meal. A "discrete period of time" refers

and for a given individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized
more by an abnormality in the amount of food consumed than by a craving
for a specific nutrient.

Binge eating must be characterized by marked distress (Criterion C) and
at least three of the following features: eating much more rapidly than
normal; eating until feeling uncomfortably full; eating large amounts of
food when not feeling physically hungry; eating alone because of feeling
embarrassed by how much one is eating; and feeling disgusted with
oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward (Criterion B).

Individuals with binge-eating disorder are typically ashamed of their

negative feelings related to body weight, body shape, and food; and
boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mitigate factors that precipitated
the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation and
dysphoria often are the delayed consequences.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Binge-eating disorder occurs in normal-weight/overweight and obese
individuals. It is reliably associated with overweight and obesity in
treatment-seeking individuals. Nevertheless, binge-eating disorder is
distinct from obesity. Most obese individuals do not engage in recurrent
binge eating. In addition, compared with weight-matched obese
individuals without binge-eating disorder, those with the disorder
consume more calories in laboratory studies of eating behavior and have
greater functional impairment, lower quality of life, more subjective
distress, and greater psychiatric comorbidity.

Prevalence

Twelve-month prevalence of binge-eating disorder among U.S. adult (age
18 or older) females and males is 1.6% and 0.8%, respectively. The
gender ratio is far less skewed in binge-eating disorder than in bulimia
nervosa. Binge-eating disorder is as prevalent among females from racial
or ethnic minority groups as has been reported for white females. The
disorder is more prevalent among individuals seeking weight-loss
treatment than in the general population.

Feeding and Eating Disorders

Development and Course

Little is known about the development of binge-eating disorder. Both
binge eating and loss-of-control eating without objectively excessive
consumption occur in children and are associated with increased body
fat, weight gain, and increases in psychological symptoms.

Binge eating is common in adolescent and college-age samples.
Loss-of-control eating or episodic binge eating may represent a
prodromal phase of eating disorders for some individuals.

Dieting follows the development of binge eating in many individuals with
binge-eating disorder. (This is in contrast to bulimia nervosa, in which
dysfunctional dieting usually precedes the onset of binge eating.)
Binge-eating disorder typically begins in adolescence or young adulthood
but can begin in later adulthood. Individuals with binge-eating disorder
who seek treatment usually are older than individuals with either
bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa who seek treatment.

Remission rates in both natural course and treatment outcome studies are
higher for binge-eating disorder than for bulimia nervosa or anorexia
nervosa. Binge-eating disorder appears to be relatively persistent, and
the course is comparable to that of bulimia nervosa in terms of severity
and duration. Crossover from binge-eating disorder to other eating
disorders is uncommon.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Binge-eating disorder appears to run in families, which may reflect
additive genetic influences.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Binge-eating disorder occurs with roughly similar frequencies in most
industrialized countries, including the United States, Canada, many
European countries, Australia, and New Zealand. In the United States,
the prevalence of binge-eating disorder appears comparable among
non-Latino whites, Latinos, Asians, and African Americans.

Functional Consequences of Binge-Eating Disorder

Binge-eating disorder is associated with a range of functional
consequences, including social role adjustment problems, impaired
health-related quality of life and life satisfaction, increased medical
morbidity and mortality, and associated increased health care
utilization compared with body mass index (BMI)--matched control
subjects. It may also be associated with an increased risk for weight
gain and the development of obesity.

Differential Diagnosis

Bulimia nervosa.

Binge-eating disorder has recurrent binge eating in common with bulimia
nervosa but differs from the latter disorder in some fundamental
respects. In terms of clinical presentation, the recurrent inappropriate
compensatory behavior (e.g., purging, driven exercise) seen in bulimia
nervosa is absent in binge-eating disorder. Unlike individuals with
bulimia nervosa, individuals with binge-eating disorder typically do not
show marked or sustained dietary restriction designed to influence body
weight and shape between binge-eating episodes. They may, however,
report frequent attempts at dieting. Binge-eating disorder also differs
from bulimia nervosa in terms of response to treatment. Rates of
improvement are consistently higher among individuals with binge-eating
disorder than among those with bulimia nervosa.

Obesity.

Binge-eating disorder is associated with overweight and obesity but has
several key features that are distinct from obesity. First, levels of
overvaluation of body

[]{#index_split_030.html#p398}Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder
**353**

weight and shape are higher in obese individuals with the disorder than
in those without the disorder. Second, rates of psychiatric comorbidity
are significantly higher among obese individuals with the disorder
compared with those without the disorder. Third, the long-term
successful outcome of evidence-based psychological treatments for
binge-eating disorder can be contrasted with the absence of effective
long-term treatments for obesity.

Bipolar and depressive disorders.

Increases in appetite and weight gain are included

in the criteria for major depressive episode and in the atypical
features specifiers for depressive and bipolar disorders. Increased
eating in the context of a major depressive episode may or may not be
associated with loss of control. If the full criteria for both disorders
are met, both diagnoses can be given. Binge eating and other symptoms of
disordered eating are seen in association with bipolar disorder. If the
full criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be
given.

Borderline personality disorder.

Binge eating is included in the impulsive behavior criterion that is
part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If the full
criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given.

Comorbidity

Binge-eating disorder is associated with significant psychiatric
comorbidity that is comparable to that of bulimia nervosa and anorexia
nervosa. The most common comorbid disorders are bipolar disorders,
depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser degree,
substance use disorders. The psychiatric comorbidity is linked to the
severity of binge eating and not to the degree of obesity.

Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder

**307.59 (F50.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a feeding and eating disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class. The
other specified feeding or eating disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific
feeding and eating disorder. This is done by recording "other specified
feeding or eating disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g.,
"bulimia nervosa of low frequency").

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following:

1\. **Atypical anorexia nervosa:** All of the criteria for anorexia
nervosa are met, except that despite significant weight loss, the
individual's weight is within or above the normal range.

2\. **Bulimia nervosa (of low frequency and/or limited duration):** All
of the criteria for bulimia nervosa are met, except that the binge
eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors occur, on average, less
than once a week and/or for less than 3 months.

3\. **Binge-eating disorder (of low frequency and/or limited
duration):** All of the criteria for binge-eating disorder are met,
except that the binge eating occurs, on average, less than once a week
and/or for less than 3 months.

4\. **Purging disorder:** Recurrent purging behavior to influence weight
or shape (e.g., self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics,
or other medications) in the absence of binge eating.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p399}**354**

Feeding and Eating Disorders

5\. **Night eating syndrome:** Recurrent episodes of night eating, as
manifested by eating after awakening from sleep or by excessive food
consumption after the evening meal.

There is awareness and recall of the eating. The night eating is not
better explained by external influences such as changes in the
individual's sleep-wake cycle or by local social norms. The night eating
causes significant distress and/or impairment in functioning. The
disordered pattern of eating is not better explained by binge-eating
disorder or another mental disorder, including substance use, and is not
attributable to another medical disorder or to an effect of medication.

Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder

**307.50 (F50.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a feeding and eating disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situations in
which the clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason that the
criteria are not met for a specific feeding and eating disorder, and
includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to
make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

[]{#index_split_030.html#p400}**Elimination**

**Disorders**

Elimination disorders all involve the inappropriate elimination of urine
or feces and are usually first diagnosed in childhood or adolescence.
This group of disorders includes *enuresis,* the repeated voiding of
urine into inappropriate places, and *encopresis,* the repeated passage
of feces into inappropriate places. Subtypes are provided to
differentiate nocturnal from diurnal (i.e., during waking hours) voiding
for enuresis and the presence or absence of constipation and overflow
incontinence for encopresis. Although there are minimum age requirements
for diagnosis of both disorders, these are based on developmental age
and not solely on chronological age. Both disorders may be voluntary or
involuntary.

Although these disorders typically occur separately, co-occurrence may
also be observed.

Enuresis

Diagnostic Criteria

**307.6 (F98.0)**

A. Repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes, whether involuntary or
intentional.

B. The behavior is clinically significant as manifested by either a
frequency of at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months or
the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning.

C. Chronological age is at least 5 years (or equivalent developmental
level).

D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a diuretic, an antipsychotic medication) or another
medical condition (e.g., diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder).

*Specify* whether:

**Nocturnal only:** Passage of urine only during nighttime sleep.

**Diurnal only:** Passage of urine during waking hours.

**Nocturnal and diurnal:** A combination of the two subtypes above.

Subtypes

The nocturnal-only subtype of enuresis, sometimes referred to as
*monosymptomatic enuresis,* is the most common subtype and involves
incontinence only during nighttime sleep, typically during the first
one-third of the night. The diurnal-only subtype occurs in the absence
of nocturnal enuresis and may be referred to simply as *urinary
incontinence.* Individuals with this subtype can be divided into two
groups. Individuals with "urge incontinence" have sudden urge symptoms
and detrusor instability, whereas individuals with "voiding
postponement" consciously defer micturition urges until incontinence
results.

The nocturnal-and-diurnal subtype is also known as *nonmonosymptomatic
enuresis.*

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of enuresis is repeated voiding of urine during
the day or at night into bed or clothes (Criterion A). Most often the
voiding is involuntary, but occasionally it may **355**

[]{#index_split_030.html#p401}**356**

Elimination Disorders

be intentional. To qualify for a diagnosis of enuresis, the voiding of
urine must occur at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months
or must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning
(Criterion B). The individual must have reached an age at which
continence is expected (i.e., a chronological age of at least 5 years
or, for children with developmental delays, a mental age of at least 5
years) (Criterion C). The urinary incontinence is not attributable to
the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a diuretic, an
antipsychotic medication) or another medical condition (e.g., diabetes,
spina bifida, a seizure disorder) (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

During nocturnal enuresis, occasionally the voiding takes place during
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and the child may recall a dream that
involved the act of urinating. During daytime (diurnal) enuresis, the
child defers voiding until incontinence occurs, sometimes because of a
reluctance to use the toilet as a result of social anxiety or a
preoccupation with school or play activity. The enuretic event most
commonly occurs in the early afternoon on school days and may be
associated with symptoms of disruptive behavior. The enuresis commonly
persists after appropriate treatment of an associated infection.

Prevalence

The prevalence of enuresis is 5%--10% among 5-year-olds, 3%--5% among
10-year-olds, and around 1% among individuals 15 years or older.

Development and Course

Two types of course of enuresis have been described: a "primary" type,
in which the individual has never established urinary continence, and a
"secondary" type, in which the disturbance develops after a period of
established urinary continence. There are no differences in prevalence
of comorbid mental disorders between the two types. By definition,
primary enuresis begins at age 5 years. The most common time for the
onset of secondary enuresis is between ages 5 and 8 years, but it may
occur at any time. After age 5 years, the rate of spontaneous remission
is 5%--10% per year. Most children with the disorder become continent by
adolescence, but in approximately 1% of cases the disorder continues
into adulthood.

Diurnal enuresis is uncommon after age 9 years. While occasional diurnal
incontinence is not uncommon in middle childhood, it is substantially
more common in those who also have persistent nocturnal enuresis. When
enuresis persists into late childhood or adolescence, the frequency of
incontinence may increase, whereas continence in early childhood is
usually associated with a declining frequency of wet nights.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

A number of predisposing factors for enuresis have been suggested,
including delayed or lax toilet training and psychosocial stress.

Genetic and physiological.

Enuresis has been associated with delays in the development of normal
circadian rhythms of urine production, with resulting nocturnal polyuria
or abnormalities of central vasopressin receptor sensitivity, and
reduced functional bladder capacities with bladder hyperreactivity
(unstable bladder syndrome). Nocturnal enuresis is a genetically
heterogeneous disorder. Heritability has been shown in family, twin, and
segregation analyses. Risk for childhood nocturnal enuresis is
approximately 3.6 times higher in offspring of enuretic mothers and 10.1
times higher in the presence of paternal urinary incontinence. The risk
magnitudes for nocturnal enuresis and diurnal incontinence are similar.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p402}Encopresis

**357**

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Enuresis has been reported in a variety of European, African, and Asian
countries as well as in the United States. At a national level,
prevalence rates are remarkably similar, and there is great similarity
in the developmental trajectories found in different countries.

There are very high rates of enuresis in orphanages and other
residential institutions, likely related to the mode and environment in
which toilet training occurs.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Nocturnal enuresis is more common in males. Diurnal incontinence is more
common in females. The relative risk of having a child who develops
enuresis is greater for previously enuretic fathers than for previously
enuretic mothers.

Functional Consequences of Enuresis

The amount of impairment associated with enuresis is a function of the
limitation on the child's social activities (e.g., ineligibility for
sleep-away camp) or its effect on the child's self-esteem, the degree of
social ostracism by peers, and the anger, punishment, and rejection on
the part of caregivers.

Differential Diagnosis

Neurogenic bladder or another medical condition.

The diagnosis of enuresis is not made

in the presence of a neurogenic bladder or another medical condition
that causes polyuria or urgency (e.g., untreated diabetes mellitus or
diabetes insipidus) or during an acute urinary tract infection. However,
a diagnosis is compatible with such conditions if urinary incontinence
was regularly present prior to the development of another medical
condition or if it persists after the institution of appropriate
treatment of the medical condition.

Medication side effects.

Enuresis may occur during treatment with antipsychotic medications,
diuretics, or other medications that may induce incontinence. In this
case, the diagnosis should not be made in isolation but may be noted as
a medication side effect.

However, a diagnosis of enuresis may be made if urinary incontinence was
regularly present prior to treatment with the medication.

Comorbidity

Although most children with enuresis do not have a comorbid mental
disorder, the prevalence of comorbid behavioral symptoms is higher in
children with enuresis than in children without enuresis. Developmental
delays, including speech, language, learning, and motor skills delays,
are also present in a portion of children with enuresis. Encopresis,
sleepwalking, and sleep terror disorder may be present. Urinary tract
infections are more common in children with enuresis, especially the
diurnal subtype, than in those who are continent.

Encopresis

Diagnostic Criteria

**307.7 (F98.1)**

A. Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., clothing,
floor), whether involuntary or intentional.

B. At least one such event occurs each month for at least 3 months.

C. Chronological age is at least 4 years (or equivalent developmental
level).

D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., laxatives) or another medical condition except through
a mechanism involving constipation.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p403}**358**

Elimination Disorders

*Specify* whether:

**With constipation and overflow incontinence:** There is evidence of
constipation on physical examination or by history.

**Without constipation and overflow incontinence:** There is no evidence
of constipation on physical examination or by history.

Subtypes

Feces in the with constipation and overflow incontinence subtype are
characteristically (but not invariably) poorly formed, and leakage can
be infrequent to continuous, occurring mostly during the day and rarely
during sleep. Only part of the feces is passed during toileting, and the
incontinence resolves after treatment of the constipation.

In the without constipation and overflow incontinence subtype, feces are
likely to be of normal form and consistency, and soiling is
intermittent. Feces may be deposited in a prominent location. This is
usually associated with the presence of oppositional defiant disorder or
conduct disorder or may be the consequence of anal masturbation. Soiling
without constipation appears to be less common than soiling with
constipation.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of encopresis is repeated passage of feces into
inappropriate places (e.g., clothing or floor) (Criterion A). Most often
the passage is involuntary but occasionally may be intentional. The
event must occur at least once a month for at least 3 months (Criterion
B), and the chronological age of the child must be at least 4 years (or
for children with developmental delays, the mental age must be at least
4 years) (Criterion C). The fecal incontinence must not be exclusively
attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
laxatives) or another medical condition except through a mechanism
involving constipation (Criterion D).

When the passage of feces is involuntary rather than intentional, it is
often related to constipation, impaction, and retention with subsequent
overflow. The constipation may develop for psychological reasons (e.g.,
anxiety about defecating in a particular place, a more general pattern
of anxious or oppositional behavior), leading to avoidance of
defecation. Physiological predispositions to constipation include
ineffectual straining or paradoxical defecation dynamics, with
contraction rather than relaxation of the external sphincter or pelvic
floor during straining for defecation. Dehydration associated with a
febrile illness, hypothyroidism, or a medication side effect can also
induce constipation. Once constipation has developed, it may be
complicated by an anal fissure, painful defecation, and further fecal
retention. The consistency of the stool may vary. In some individuals
the stool may be of normal or near-normal consistency. In other
individuals---such as those with overflow incontinence secondary to
fecal retention---it may be liquid.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The child with encopresis often feels ashamed and may wish to avoid
situations (e.g., camp, school) that might lead to embarrassment. The
amount of impairment is a function of the effect on the child\'s
self-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by peers, and the anger,
punishment, and rejection on the part of caregivers. Smearing feces may
be deliberate or accidental, resulting from the child's attempt to clean
or hide feces that were passed in-voluntarily. When the incontinence is
clearly deliberate, features of oppositional defiant disorder or conduct
disorder may also be present. Many children with encopresis and chronic
constipation also have enuresis symptoms and may have associated urinary
reflux in the bladder or ureters that may lead to chronic urinary
infections, the symptoms of which may remit with treatment of the
constipation.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p404}Other Specified Elimination Disorder
**359**

Prevalence

It is estimated that approximately 1% of 5-year-olds have encopresis,
and the disorder is more common in males than in females.

Development and Course

Encopresis is not diagnosed until a child has reached a chronological
age of at least 4 years (or for children with developmental delays, a
mental age of at least 4 years). Inadequate, inconsistent toilet
training and psychosocial stress (e.g., entering school, the birth of a
sibling) may be predisposing factors. Two types of course have been
described: a "primary"

type, in which the individual has never established fecal continence,
and a "secondary"

type, in which the disturbance develops after a period of established
fecal continence. Encopresis can persist, with intermittent
exacerbations, for years.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Painful defecation can lead to constipation and a cycle of withholding
behaviors that make encopresis more likely. Use of some medications
(e.g., anticonvulsants, cough suppressants) may increase constipation
and make encopresis more likely.

Diagnostic Markers

In addition to physical examination, gastrointestinal imaging (e.g.,
abdominal radiograph) may be informative to assess retained stool and
gas in the colon. Additional tests, such as barium enema and anorectal
manography, may be used to help exclude other medical conditions, such
as Hirschsprung's disease.

Differential Diagnosis

A diagnosis of encopresis in the presence of another medical condition
is appropriate only if the mechanism involves constipation that cannot
be explained by other medical conditions. Fecal incontinence related to
other medical conditions (e.g., chronic diarrhea, spina bifida, anal
stenosis) would not warrant a DSM-5 diagnosis of encopresis.

Comorbidity

Urinary tract infections can be comorbid with encopresis and are more
common in females.

Other Specified Elimination Disorder

 

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an elimination disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified elimination disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific elimination
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified elimination
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "low-frequency
enuresis").

**Coding note:** Code **788.39 (N39.498)** for other specified
elimination disorder with urinary symptoms; **787.60 (R15.9)** for other

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an elimination disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
elimination disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific elimination disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

**Coding note:** Code **788.30 (R32)** for unspecified elimination
disorder with urinary symptoms; **787.60 (R15.9)** for unspecified

[]{#index_split_030.html#p406}**Sleep-Wake**

**Disorders**

The DSM-5 classification of sleep-wake disorders is intended for use by
general mental health and medical clinicians (those caring for adult,
geriatric, and pediatric patients). Sleep-wake disorders encompass 10
disorders or disorder groups: insomnia disorder, hypersomnolence
disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian
rhythm sleep-wake disorders, non--rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep
arousal disorders, nightmare disorder, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Individuals with these
disorders typically present with sleep-wake complaints of
dissatisfaction regarding the quality, timing, and amount of sleep.
Resulting daytime distress and impairment are core features shared by
all of these sleep-wake disorders.

The organization of this chapter is designed to facilitate differential
diagnosis of sleep-wake complaints and to clarify when referral to a
sleep specialist is appropriate for further assessment and treatment
planning. The DSM-5 sleep disorders nosology uses a simple, clinically
useful approach, while also reflecting scientific advances in
epidemiology, genetics, pathophysiology, assessment, and interventions
research since DSM-IV. In some cases (e.g., insomnia disorder), a
"lumping" approach has been adopted, whereas in others (e.g.,
narcolepsy), a "splitting" approach has been taken, reflecting the
availability of validators derived from epidemiological,
neurobiological, and interventions research.

Sleep disorders are often accompanied by depression, anxiety, and
cognitive changes that must be addressed in treatment planning and
management. Furthermore, persistent sleep disturbances (both insomnia
and excessive sleepiness) are established risk factors for the
subsequent development of mental illnesses and substance use disorders.
They may also represent a prodromal expression of an episode of mental
illness, allowing the possibility of early intervention to preempt or to
attenuate a full-blown episode.

The differential diagnosis of sleep-wake complaints necessitates a
multidimensional approach, with consideration of possibly coexisting
medical and neurological conditions.

Coexisting clinical conditions are the rule, not the exception. Sleep
disturbances furnish a clinically useful indicator of medical and
neurological conditions that often coexist with depression and other
common mental disorders. Prominent among these comorbidities are
breathing-related sleep disorders, disorders of the heart and lungs
(e.g., congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease),
neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), and disorders
of the musculoskeletal system (e.g., osteoarthritis).

These disorders not only may disturb sleep but also may themselves be
worsened during sleep (e.g., prolonged apneas or electrocardiographic
arrhythmias during REM sleep; confusional arousals in patients with
dementing illness; seizures in persons with complex partial seizures).
REM sleep behavior disorder is often an early indicator of
neurodegenerative disorders (alpha synucleinopathies) like Parkinson's
disease. For all of these reasons---related to differential diagnosis,
clinical comorbidity, and facilitation of treatment planning---sleep
disorders are included in DSM-5.

The approach taken to the classification of sleep-wake disorders in
DSM-5 can be understood within the context of "lumping versus
splitting." DSM-IV represented an effort to simplify sleep-wake
disorders classification and thus aggregated diagnoses under broader,
less differentiated labels. At the other pole, the *International
Classification of Sleep Disorders,* **361**

[]{#index_split_030.html#p407}**362**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

2nd Edition (ICSD-2) elaborated numerous diagnostic subtypes. DSM-IV was
prepared for use by mental health and general medical clinicians who are
not experts in sleep medicine.

ICSD-2 reflected the science and opinions of the sleep specialist
community and was prepared for use by specialists.

The weight of available evidence supports the superior performance
characteristics (interrater reliability, as well as convergent,
discriminant, and face validity) of simpler, less-differentiated
approaches to diagnosis of sleep-wake disorders. The text accompanying
each set of diagnostic criteria provides linkages to the corresponding
disorders included in ICSD-2. The DSM-5 sleep-wake disorders
classification also specifies corresponding nonpsychiatric listings
(e.g., neurology codes) from the *International Classification of
Diseases* (ICD).

The field of sleep disorders medicine has progressed in this direction
since the publication of DSM-IV. The use of biological validators is now
embodied in the DSM-5 classification of sleep-wake disorders,
particularly for disorders of excessive sleepiness, such as narcolepsy;
for breathing-related sleep disorders, for which formal sleep studies
(i.e., polysomnography) are indicated; and for restless legs syndrome,
which can often coexist with periodic limb movements during sleep,
detectable via polysomnography.

Insomnia Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**307.42 (F51.01)**

A. A predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or
quality, associated with one (or more) of the following symptoms:

1\. Difficulty initiating sleep. (In children, this may manifest as
difficulty initiating sleep without caregiver intervention.)

2\. Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakenings
or problems returning to sleep after awakenings. (In children, this may
manifest as difficulty returning to sleep without caregiver
intervention.)

3\. Early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.

B. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral,
or other important areas of functioning.

C. The sleep difficulty occurs at least 3 nights per week.

D. The sleep difficulty is present for at least 3 months.

E. The sleep difficulty occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep.

F. The insomnia is not better explained by and does not occur
exclusively during the course of another sleep-wake disorder (e.g.,
narcolepsy, a breathing-related sleep disorder, a circadian rhythm
sleep-wake disorder, a parasomnia).

G. The insomnia is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).

H. Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately
explain the predominant complaint of insomnia.

*Specify* if:

**With non--sleep disorder mental comorbidity,** including substance use
disorders **With other medical comorbidity**

**With other sleep disorder**

**Coding note:** The code 307.42 (F51.01) applies to all three
specifiers. Code also the relevant associated mental disorder, medical
condition, or other sleep disorder immediately after the code for
insomnia disorder in order to indicate the association.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p408}Insomnia Disorder

**363**

*Specify* if:

**Episodic:** Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.

**Persistent:** Symptoms last 3 months or longer.

**Recurrent:** Two (or more) episodes within the space of 1 year.

**Note:** Acute and short-term insomnia (i.e., symptoms lasting less
than 3 months but otherwise meeting all criteria with regard to
frequency, intensity, distress, and/or impairment) should be coded as an
other specified insomnia disorder.

**Note.** The diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given whether it occurs
as an independent condition or is comorbid with another mental disorder
(e.g., major depressive disorder), medical condition (e.g., pain), or
another sleep disorder (e.g., a breathing-related sleep disorder). For
instance, insomnia may develop its own course with some anxiety and
depressive features but in the absence of criteria being met for any one
mental disorder. Insomnia may also manifest as a clinical feature of a
more predominant mental disorder. Persistent insomnia may even be a risk
factor for depression and is a common residual symptom after treatment
for this condition. With comorbid insomnia and a mental disorder,
treatment may also need to target both conditions. Given these different
courses, it is often impossible to establish the precise nature of the
relationship between these clinical entities, and this relationship may
change over time. Therefore, in the presence of insomnia and a comorbid
disorder, it is not necessary to make a causal attribution between the
two conditions. Rather, the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is made with
concurrent specification of the clinically comorbid conditions. A
concurrent insomnia diagnosis should only be considered when the
insomnia is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical
attention; otherwise, no separate diagnosis is necessary.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of insomnia disorder is dissatisfaction with sleep
quantity or quality with complaints of difficulty initiating or
maintaining sleep. The sleep complaints are accompanied by clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning. The sleep disturbance may occur during
the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, or it may
occur independently.

Different manifestations of insomnia can occur at different times of the
sleep period. *Sleep-onset insomnia* (or *initial insomnia*) involves
difficulty initiating sleep at bedtime. *Sleep maintenance insomnia* (or
*middle insomnia*) involves frequent or prolonged awakenings throughout
the night. *Late insomnia* involves early-morning awakening with an
inability to return to sleep.

Difficulty maintaining sleep is the most common single symptom of
insomnia, followed by difficulty falling asleep, while a combination of
these symptoms is the most common presentation overall. The specific
type of sleep complaint often varies over time. Individuals who complain
of difficulty falling asleep at one time may later complain of
difficulty maintaining sleep, and vice versa. Symptoms of difficulty
falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep can be quantified by the
individual's retrospective self-report, sleep diaries, or other methods,
such as actigraphy or polysomnography, but the diagnosis of insomnia
disorder is based on the individual's subjective perception of sleep or
a caretaker's report.

*Nonrestorative sleep,* a complaint of poor sleep quality that does not
leave the individual rested upon awakening despite adequate duration, is
a common sleep complaint usually occurring in association with
difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in
isolation. This complaint can also be reported in association with other
sleep disorders (e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder). When a
complaint of nonrestorative sleep occurs in isolation (i.e., in the
absence of difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep) but all
diagnostic criteria with regard to frequency, duration, and daytime
distress and impairments are otherwise met, a diagnosis of other
specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p409}**364**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Aside from the frequency and duration criteria required to make the
diagnosis, additional criteria are useful to quantify insomnia severity.
These quantitative criteria, while arbitrary, are provided for
illustrative purpose only. For instance, difficulty initiating sleep is
defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than 20--30 minutes, and
difficulty maintaining sleep is defined by a subjective time awake after
sleep onset greater than 20--30 minutes. Although there is no standard
definition of early-morning awakening, this symptom involves awakening
at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time and before total sleep
time reaches 6½ hours. It is essential to take into account not only the
final awakening time but also the bedtime on the previous evening.
Awakening at 4:00 A.M. does not have the same clinical significance in
those who go to bed at 9:00 P.M. as in those who go to bed at 11:00 P.M.
Such a symptom may also reflect an age-dependent decrease in the ability
to sustain sleep or an age-dependent shift in the timing of the main
sleep period.

Insomnia disorder involves daytime impairments as well as nighttime
sleep difficulties.

These include fatigue or, less commonly, daytime sleepiness; the latter
is more common among older individuals and when insomnia is comorbid
with another medical condition (e.g., chronic pain) or sleep disorder
(e.g., sleep apnea). Impairment in cognitive performance may include
difficulties with attention, concentration and memory, and even with
performing simple manual skills. Associated mood disturbances are
typically described as irritability or mood lability and less commonly
as depressive or anxiety symptoms. Not all individuals with nighttime
sleep disturbances are distressed or have functional impairment. For
example, sleep continuity is often interrupted in healthy older adults
who nevertheless identify themselves as good sleepers. A diagnosis of
insomnia disorder should be reserved for those individuals with
significant daytime distress or impairment related to their nighttime
sleep difficulties.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Insomnia is often associated with physiological and cognitive arousal
and conditioning factors that interfere with sleep. A preoccupation with
sleep and distress due to the inability to sleep may lead to a vicious
cycle: the more the individual strives to sleep, the more frustration
builds and further impairs sleep. Thus, excessive attention and efforts
to sleep, which override normal sleep-onset mechanisms, may contribute
to the development of insomnia. Individuals with persistent insomnia may
also acquire maladaptive sleep habits (e.g., spending excessive time in
bed; following an erratic sleep schedule; napping) and cognitions (e.g.,
fear of sleeplessness; apprehensions of daytime impairments; clock
monitoring) during the course of the disorder. Engaging in such
activities in an environment in which the individual has frequently
spent sleepless nights may further compound the conditioned arousal and
perpetuate sleep difficulties. Conversely, the individual may fall
asleep more easily when not trying to do so. Some individuals also
report better sleep when away from their own bedrooms and their usual
routines.

Insomnia may be accompanied by a variety of daytime complaints and
symptoms, including fatigue, decreased energy, and mood disturbances.
Symptoms of anxiety or depression that do not meet criteria for a
specific mental disorder may be present, as well as an excessive focus
on the perceived effects of sleep loss on daytime functioning.

Individuals with insomnia may have elevated scores on self-report
psychological or personality inventories with profiles indicating mild
depression and anxiety, a worrisome cognitive style, an emotion-focused
and internalizing style of conflict resolution, and a somatic focus.
Patterns of neurocognitive impairment among individuals with insomnia
disorder are inconsistent, although there may be impairments in
performing tasks of higher complexity and those requiring frequent
changes in performance strategy. Individuals with insomnia often require
more effort to maintain cognitive performance.

Prevalence

Population-based estimates indicate that about one-third of adults
report insomnia symptoms, 10%--15% experience associated daytime
impairments, and 6%--10% have symptoms

[]{#index_split_030.html#p410}Insomnia Disorder

**365**

that meet criteria for insomnia disorder. Insomnia disorder is the most
prevalent of all sleep disorders. In primary care settings,
approximately 10%--20% of individuals complain of significant insomnia
symptoms. Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among females than
among males, with a gender ratio of about 1.44:1. Although insomnia can
be a symptom or an independent disorder, it is most frequently observed
as a comorbid condition with another medical condition or mental
disorder. For instance, 40%--50% of individuals with insomnia also
present with a comorbid mental disorder.

Development and Course

The onset of insomnia symptoms can occur at any time during life, but
the first episode is more common in young adulthood. Less frequently,
insomnia begins in childhood or adolescence. In women, new-onset
insomnia may occur during menopause and persist even after other
symptoms (e.g., hot flashes) have resolved. Insomnia may have a
late-life onset, which is often associated with the onset of other
health-related conditions.

Insomnia can be situational, persistent, or recurrent. Situational or
acute insomnia usually lasts a few days or a few weeks and is often
associated with life events or rapid changes in sleep schedules or
environment. It usually resolves once the initial precipitating event
subsides. For some individuals, perhaps those more vulnerable to sleep
disturbances, insomnia may persist long after the initial triggering
event, possibly because of conditioning factors and heightened arousal.
The factors that precipitate insomnia may differ from those that
perpetuate it. For example, an individual who is bedridden with a
painful injury and has difficulty sleeping may then develop negative
associations for sleep. Conditioned arousal may then persist and lead to
persistent insomnia. A similar course may develop in the context of an
acute psychological stress or a mental disorder. For instance, insomnia
that occurs during an episode of major depressive disorder can become a
focus of attention, with consequent negative conditioning, and persist
even after resolution of the depressive episode. In some cases, insomnia
may also have an insidious onset without any identifiable precipitating
factor.

The course of insomnia may also be episodic, with recurrent episodes of
sleep difficulties associated with the occurrence of stressful events.
Chronicity rates range from 45%

to 75% for follow-ups of 1--7 years. Even when the course of the
insomnia has become chronic, there is night-to-night variability in
sleep patterns, with an occasional restful night's sleep interspersed
with several nights of poor sleep. The characteristics of insomnia may
also change over time. Many individuals with insomnia have a history of
"light" or easily disturbed sleep prior to onset of more persistent
sleep problems.

Insomnia complaints are more prevalent among middle-age and older
adults. The type of insomnia symptom changes as a function of age, with
difficulties initiating sleep being more common among young adults and
problems maintaining sleep occurring more frequently among middle-age
and older individuals.

Difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep can also occur in children
and adolescents, but there are more limited data on prevalence, risk
factors, and comorbidity during these developmental phases of the
lifespan. Sleep difficulties in childhood can result from conditioning
factors (e.g., a child who does not learn to fall asleep or return to
sleep without the presence of a parent) or from the absence of
consistent sleep schedules and bedtime routines. Insomnia in adolescence
is often triggered or exacerbated by irregular sleep schedules (e.g.,
phase delay). In both children and adolescents, psychological and
medical factors can contribute to insomnia.

The increased prevalence of insomnia in older adults is partly explained
by the higher incidence of physical health problems with aging. Changes
in sleep patterns associated with the normal developmental process must
be differentiated from those exceeding age-related changes. Although
polysomnography is of limited value in the routine evaluation of
insomnia, it may be more useful in the differential diagnosis among
older adults because the etiologies of insomnia (e.g., sleep apnea) are
more often identifiable in older individuals.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p411}**366**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Risk and Prognostic Factors

While the risk and prognostic factors discussed in this section increase
vulnerability to insomnia, sleep disturbances are more likely to occur
when predisposed individuals are exposed to precipitating events, such
as major life events (e.g., illness, separation) or less severe but more
chronic daily stress. Most individuals resume normal sleep patterns
after the initial triggering event has disappeared, but others---perhaps
those more vulnerable to insomnia---continue experiencing persistent
sleep difficulties. Perpetuating factors such as poor sleep habits,
irregular sleep scheduling, and the fear of not sleeping feed into the
insomnia problem and may contribute to a vicious cycle that may induce
persistent insomnia.

Temperamental.

Anxiety or worry-prone personality or cognitive styles, increased
arousal predisposition, and tendency to repress emotions can increase
vulnerability to insomnia.

Environmental.

Noise, light, uncomfortably high or low temperature, and high altitude
may also increase vulnerability to insomnia.

Genetic and physiological.

Female gender and advancing age are associated with increased
vulnerability to insomnia. Disrupted sleep and insomnia display a
familial disposition. The prevalence of insomnia is higher among
monozygotic twins relative to dizygotic twins; it is also higher in
first-degree family members compared with the general population. The
extent to which this link is inherited through a genetic predisposition,
learned by observations of parental models, or established as a
by-product of another psychopathology remains undetermined.

Course modifiers.

Deleterious course modifiers include poor sleep hygiene practices (e.g.,
excessive caffeine use, irregular sleep schedules).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among females than among males,
with first onset often associated with the birth of a new child or with
menopause. Despite higher prevalence among older females,
polysomnographic studies suggest better preservation of sleep continuity
and slow-wave sleep in older females than in older males.

Diagnostic Markers

Polysomnography usually shows impairments of sleep continuity (e.g.,
increased sleep latency and time awake after sleep onset and decreased
sleep efficiency \[percentage of time in bed asleep\] and may show
increased stage 1 sleep and decreased stages 3 and 4 sleep.

The severity of these sleep impairments does not always match the
individual's clinical presentation or subjective complaint of poor
sleep, as individuals with insomnia often underestimate sleep duration
and overestimate wakefulness relative to polysomnography.

Quantitative electroencephalographic analyses may indicate that
individuals with insomnia have greater high-frequency
electroencephalography power relative to good sleepers both around the
sleep onset period and during non--rapid eye movement sleep, a feature
suggestive of increased cortical arousal. Individuals with insomnia
disorder may have a lower sleep propensity and typically do not show
increased daytime sleepiness on objective sleep laboratory measures
compared with individuals without sleep disorders.

Other laboratory measures show evidence, although not consistently, of
increased arousal and a generalized activation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., increased cortisol levels,
heart rate variability, reactivity to stress, metabolic rate). In
general, findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased
physiological and cognitive arousal plays a significant role in insomnia
disorder.

Individuals with insomnia disorder may appear either fatigued or haggard
or, conversely, overaroused and "wired." However, there are no
consistent or characteristic abnormalities on physical examination.
There may be an increased incidence of stress-

[]{#index_split_030.html#p412}Insomnia Disorder

**367**

related psychophysiological symptoms (e.g., tension headache, muscle
tension or pain, gastrointestinal symptoms).

Functional Consequences of Insomnia Disorder

Interpersonal, social, and occupational problems may develop as a result
of insomnia or excessive concern with sleep, increased daytime
irritability, and poor concentration. Decreased attention and
concentration are common and may be related to higher rates of accidents
observed in insomnia. Persistent insomnia is also associated with
long-term consequences, including increased risks of major depressive
disorder, hypertension, and myocardial infarction; increased absenteeism
and reduced productivity at work; reduced quality of life; and increased
economic burden.

Differential Diagnosis

Normal sleep variations.

Normal sleep duration varies considerably across individuals.

Some individuals who require little sleep ("short sleepers") may be
concerned about their sleep duration. Short sleepers differ from
individuals with insomnia disorder by the lack of difficulty falling or
staying asleep and by the absence of characteristic daytime symptoms
(e.g., fatigue, concentration problems, irritability). However, some
short sleepers may desire or attempt to sleep for a longer period of
time and, by prolonging time in bed, may create an insomnia-like sleep
pattern. Clinical insomnia also should be distinguished from normal,
age-related sleep changes. Insomnia must also be distinguished from
sleep deprivation due to inadequate opportunity or circumstance for
sleep resulting, for example, from an emergency or from professional or
family obligations forcing the individual to stay awake.

Situational/acute insomnia.

*Situational/acute insomnia* is a condition lasting a few days to a few
weeks, often associated with life events or with changes in sleep
schedules. These acute or short-term insomnia symptoms may also produce
significant distress and interfere with social, personal, and
occupational functioning. When such symptoms are frequent enough and
meet all other criteria except for the 3-month duration, a diagnosis of
other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is
made.

Delayed sleep phase and shift work types of circadian rhythm sleep-wake
disorder.

Individuals with the delayed sleep phase type of circadian rhythm
sleep-wake disorder report sleep-onset insomnia only when they try to
sleep at socially normal times, but they do not report difficulty
falling asleep or staying asleep when their bed and rising times are
delayed and coincide with their endogenous circadian rhythm. Shift work
type differs from insomnia disorder by the history of recent shift work.

Restless legs syndrome.

Restless legs syndrome often produces difficulties initiating and
maintaining sleep. However, an urge to move the legs and any
accompanying unpleasant leg sensations are features that differentiate
this disorder from insomnia disorder.

Breathing-related sleep disorders.

Most individuals with a breathing-related sleep disorder have a history
of loud snoring, breathing pauses during sleep, and excessive daytime
sleepiness. Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea
may also report insomnia symptoms, a feature that is more common among
females and older adults.

Narcolepsy.

Narcolepsy may cause insomnia complaints but is distinguished from
insomnia disorder by the predominance of symptoms of excessive daytime
sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep-related
hallucinations.

Parasomnias.

Parasomnias are characterized by a complaint of unusual behavior or
events during sleep that may lead to intermittent awakenings and
difficulty resuming sleep.

However, it is these behavioral events, rather than the insomnia per se,
that dominate the clinical picture.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p413}**368**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type.

Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type, is
distinguished from insomnia disorder by the fact that a substance (i.e.,
a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a toxin) is judged to be
etiologically related to the insomnia (see "Substance/Medication-Induced
Sleep Disorder" later in this chapter). For example, insomnia occurring
only in the context of heavy coffee consumption would be diagnosed as
caffeine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type, with onset during
intoxication.

Comorbidity

Insomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including
diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
arthritis, fibromyalgia, and other chronic pain conditions. The risk
relationship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia increases the risk of
medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insomnia.
The direction of the relationship is not always clear and may change
over time; for this reason, comorbid insomnia is the preferred
terminology in the presence of coexisting insomnia with another medical
condition (or mental disorder).

Individuals with insomnia disorder frequently have a comorbid mental
disorder, particularly bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders.
Persistent insomnia represents a risk factor or an early symptom of
subsequent bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders.
Individuals with insomnia may misuse medications or alcohol to help with
nighttime sleep, anxiolytics to combat tension or anxiety, and caffeine
or other stimulants to combat excessive fatigue. In addition to
worsening the insomnia, this type of substance use may in some cases
progress to a substance use disorder.

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

There are several distinct insomnia phenotypes relating to the perceived
source of the insomnia that are recognized by the *International
Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd Edition (ICSD-2). These include
*psychophysiological insomnia,* *idiopathic insomnia,* *sleep-state
misperception,* and *inadequate sleep hygiene.* Despite their clinical
appeal and heuristic value, there is limited evidence to support these
distinct phenotypes.

Hypersomnolence Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**307.44 (F51.11)**

A. Self-reported excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence) despite a main
sleep period lasting at least 7 hours, with at least one of the
following symptoms: 1. Recurrent periods of sleep or lapses into sleep
within the same day.

2\. A prolonged main sleep episode of more than 9 hours per day that is
nonrestorative (i.e., unrefreshing).

3\. Difficulty being fully awake after abrupt awakening.

B. The hypersomnolence occurs at least three times per week, for at
least 3 months.

C. The hypersomnolence is accompanied by significant distress or
impairment in cognitive, social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

D. The hypersomnolence is not better explained by and does not occur
exclusively during the course of another sleep disorder (e.g.,
narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorder, circadian rhythm
sleep-wake disorder, or a parasomnia).

E. The hypersomnolence is not attributable to the physiological effects
of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).

while sedentary, driving, visiting with friends, or working.

**Mild:** Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 1--2 days/week.

**Moderate:** Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 3--4 days/week.

**Severe:** Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 5--7 days/week.

Diagnostic Features

*Hypersomnolence* is a broad diagnostic term and includes symptoms of
excessive quantity of sleep (e.g., extended nocturnal sleep or
involuntary daytime sleep), deteriorated quality of wakefulness (i.e.,
sleep propensity during wakefulness as shown by difficulty awakening or
inability to remain awake when required), and sleep inertia (i.e., a
period of impaired performance and reduced vigilance following awakening
from the regular sleep episode or from a nap) (Criterion A). Individuals
with this disorder fall asleep quickly and have a good sleep efficiency
(\>90%). They may have difficulty waking up in the morning, sometimes
appearing confused, combative, or ataxic. This prolonged impairment of
alertness at the sleep-wake transition is often referred to as *sleep
inertia* (i.e., sleep drunkenness).

It can also occur upon awakening from a daytime nap. During that period,
the individual appears awake, but there is a decline in motor dexterity,
behavior may be very inappropriate, and memory deficits, disorientation
in time and space, and feelings of grogginess may occur. This period may
last some minutes to hours.

The persistent need for sleep can lead to automatic behavior (usually of
a very routine, low-complexity type) that the individual carries out
with little or no subsequent recall. For example, individuals may find
themselves having driven several miles from where they thought they
were, unaware of the "automatic" driving they did in the preceding
minutes.

For some individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep
episode (for most individuals, nocturnal sleep) has a duration of 9
hours or more. However, the sleep is often nonrestorative and is
followed by difficulty awakening in the morning. For other individuals
with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode is of normal
nocturnal sleep duration (6--9 hours). In these cases, the excessive
sleepiness is characterized by several unintentional daytime naps. These
daytime naps tend to be relatively long (often lasting 1 hour or more),
are experienced as nonrestorative (i.e., unrefreshing), and do not lead
to improved alertness. Individuals with hypersomnolence have daytime
naps nearly everyday regardless of the nocturnal sleep duration.
Subjective sleep quality may or may not be reported as good. Individuals
typically feel sleepiness developing over a period of time, rather than
[]{#index_split_030.html#p415}**370**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

experiencing a sudden sleep "attack." Unintentional sleep episodes
typically occur in low-stimulation and low-activity situations (e.g.,
while attending lectures, reading, watching television, or driving long
distances), but in more severe cases they can manifest in high-attention
situations such as at work, in meetings, or at social gatherings.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Nonrestorative sleep, automatic behavior, difficulties awakening in the
morning, and sleep inertia, although common in hypersomnolence disorder,
may also be seen in a variety of conditions, including narcolepsy.
Approximately 80% of individuals with hypersomnolence report that their
sleep is nonrestorative, and as many have difficulties awakening in the
morning. Sleep inertia, though less common (i.e., observed in 36%--50%
of individuals with hypersomnolence disorder), is highly specific to
hypersomnolence. Short naps (i.e., duration of less than 30 minutes) are
often unrefreshing. Individuals with hypersomnolence often appear sleepy
and may even fall asleep in the clinician's waiting area.

A subset of individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have a family
history of hypersomnolence and also have symptoms of autonomic nervous
system dysfunction, including recurrent vascular-type headaches,
reactivity of the peripheral vascular system (Raynaud's phenomenon), and
fainting.

Prevalence

Approximately 5%--10% of individuals who consult in sleep disorders
clinics with complaints of daytime sleepiness are diagnosed as having
hypersomnolence disorder. It is estimated that about 1% of the European
and U.S. general population has episodes of sleep inertia.
Hypersomnolence occurs with relatively equal frequency in males and
females.

Development and Course

Hypersomnolence disorder has a persistent course, with a progressive
evolution in the severity of symptoms. In most extreme cases, sleep
episodes can last up to 20 hours. However, the average nighttime sleep
duration is around 9½ hours. While many individuals with hypersomnolence
are able to reduce their sleep time during working days, weekend and
holiday sleep is greatly increased (by up to 3 hours). Awakenings are
very difficult and accompanied by sleep inertia episodes in nearly 40%
of cases. Hypersomnolence fully manifests in most cases in late
adolescence or early adulthood, with a mean age at onset of 17--24
years. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are diagnosed, on
average, 10--15

years after the appearance of the first symptoms. Pediatric cases are
rare.

Hypersomnolence has a progressive onset, with symptoms beginning between
ages 15

and 25 years, with a gradual progression over weeks to months. For most
individuals, the course is then persistent and stable, unless treatment
is initiated. The development of other sleep disorders (e.g.,
breathing-related sleep disorder) may worsen the degree of sleepiness.
Although hyperactivity may be one of the presenting signs of daytime
sleepiness in children, voluntary napping increases with age. This
normal phenomenon is distinct from hypersomnolence.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Hypersomnolence can be increased temporarily by psychological stress and
alcohol use, but they have not been documented as environmental
precipitating factors. Viral infections have been reported to have
preceded or accompanied hypersomnolence in about 10% of cases. Viral
infections, such as HIV pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, and
Guillain-Barré syndrome, can also evolve into hypersomnolence within

[]{#index_split_030.html#p416}Hypersomnolence Disorder

**371**

months after the infection. Hypersomnolence can also appear within 6--18
months following a head trauma.

Genetic and physiological.

Hypersomnolence may be familial, with an autosomal---

dominant mode of inheritance.

Diagnostic Markers

Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrates a normal to prolonged sleep
duration, short sleep latency, and normal to increased sleep continuity.
The distribution of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is also normal. Sleep
efficiency is mostly greater than 90%. Some individuals with
hypersomnolence disorder have increased amounts of slow-wave sleep.

The multiple sleep latency test documents sleep tendency, typically
indicated by mean sleep latency values of less than 8 minutes. In
hypersomnolence disorder, the mean sleep latency is typically less than
10 minutes and frequently 8 minutes or less. Sleep-onset REM

periods (SOREMPs; i.e., the occurrence of REM sleep within 20 minutes of
sleep onset) may be present but occur less than two times in four to
five nap opportunities.

Functional Consequences of Hypersomnolence Disorder

The low level of alertness that occurs while an individual fights the
need for sleep can lead to reduced efficiency, diminished concentration,
and poor memory during daytime activities. Hypersomnolence can lead to
significant distress and dysfunction in work and social relationships.
Prolonged nocturnal sleep and difficulty awakening can result in
difficulty in meeting morning obligations, such as arriving at work on
time. Unintentional daytime sleep episodes can be embarrassing and even
dangerous, if, for instance, the individual is driving or operating
machinery when the episode occurs.

Differential Diagnosis

Normative variation in sleep.

"Normal" sleep duration varies considerably in the general population.
"Long sleepers" (i.e., individuals who require a greater than average
amount of sleep) do not have excessive sleepiness, sleep inertia, or
automatic behavior when they obtain their required amount of nocturnal
sleep. Sleep is reported to be refreshing. If social or occupational
demands lead to shorter nocturnal sleep, daytime symptoms may appear.

In hypersomnolence disorder, by contrast, symptoms of excessive
sleepiness occur regardless of nocturnal sleep duration. An inadequate
amount of nocturnal sleep, or *behaviorally* *induced insufficient sleep
syndrome,* can produce symptoms of daytime sleepiness very similar to
those of hypersomnolence. An average sleep duration of fewer than 7
hours per night strongly suggests inadequate nocturnal sleep, and an
average of more than 9--10 hours of sleep per 24-hour period suggests
hypersomnolence. Individuals with inadequate nocturnal sleep typically
"catch up" with longer sleep durations on days when they are free from
social or occupational demands or on vacations. Unlike hypersomnolence,
insufficient nocturnal sleep is unlikely to persist unabated for
decades. A diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder should not be made if
there is a question regarding the adequacy of nocturnal sleep duration.
A diagnostic and therapeutic trial of sleep extension for 10--14 days
can often clarify the diagnosis.

Poor sleep quality and fatigue.

Hypersomnolence disorder should be distinguished

from excessive sleepiness related to insufficient sleep quantity or
quality and fatigue (i.e., tiredness not necessarily relieved by
increased sleep and unrelated to sleep quantity or quality). Excessive
sleepiness and fatigue are difficult to differentiate and may overlap
considerably.

Breathing-related sleep disorders.

Individuals with hypersomnolence and breathing-related sleep disorders
may have similar patterns of excessive sleepiness. Breathing-

[]{#index_split_030.html#p417}**372**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

related sleep disorders are suggested by a history of loud snoring,
pauses in breathing during sleep, brain injury, or cardiovascular
disease and by the presence of obesity, oro-pharyngeal anatomical
abnormalities, hypertension, or heart failure on physical examination.
Polysomnographic studies can confirm the presence of apneic events in
breathing-related sleep disorder (and their absence in hypersomnolence
disorder).

Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.

Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are

often characterized by daytime sleepiness. A history of an abnormal
sleep-wake schedule (with shifted or irregular hours) is present in
individuals with a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder.

Parasomnias.

Parasomnias rarely produce the prolonged, undisturbed nocturnal sleep or
daytime sleepiness characteristic of hypersomnolence disorder.

Other mental disorders.

Hypersomnolence disorder must be distinguished from mental disorders
that include hypersomnolence as an essential or associated feature. In
particular, complaints of daytime sleepiness may occur in a major
depressive episode, with atypical features, and in the depressed phase
of bipolar disorder. Assessment for other mental disorders is essential
before a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder is considered. A
diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder can be made in the presence of
another current or past mental disorder.

Comorbidity

Hypersomnolence can be associated with depressive disorders, bipolar
disorders (during a depressive episode), and major depressive disorder,
with seasonal pattern. Many individuals with hypersomnolence disorder
have symptoms of depression that may meet criteria for a depressive
disorder. This presentation may be related to the psychosocial
consequences of persistent increased sleep need. Individuals with
hypersomnolence disorder are also at risk for substance-related
disorders, particularly related to self-medication with stimulants.

This general lack of specificity may contribute to very heterogeneous
profiles among individuals whose symptoms meet the same diagnostic
criteria for hypersomnolence disorder.

Neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
disease, and multiple system atrophy, may also be associated with
hypersomnolence.

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

The *International Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd Edition
(ICSD-2), differentiates nine subtypes of "hypersomnias of central
origin," including recurrent hypersomnia (Kleine-Levin syndrome).

Narcolepsy

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Recurrent periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into
sleep, or napping occurring within the same day. These must have been
occurring at least three times per week over the past 3 months.

B. The presence of at least one of the following:

1\. Episodes of cataplexy, defined as either (a) or (b), occurring at
least a few times per month:

a\. In individuals with long-standing disease, brief (seconds to
minutes) episodes of sudden bilateral loss of muscle tone with
maintained consciousness that are precipitated by laughter or joking.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p418}Narcolepsy

b\. In children or in individuals within 6 months of onset, spontaneous
grimaces or jaw-opening episodes with tongue thrusting or a global
hypotonia, without any obvious emotional triggers.

2\. Hypocretin deficiency, as measured using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
hypocretin-1

immunoreactivity values (less than or equal to one-third of values
obtained in healthy subjects tested using the same assay, or less than
or equal to 110 pg/mL).

Low CSF levels of hypocretin-1 must not be observed in the context of
acute brain injury, inflammation, or infection.

3\. Nocturnal sleep polysomnography showing rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep latency less than or equal to 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep

**347.00 (G47.419) Narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin
deficiency:** Criterion B requirements of low CSF hypocretin-1 levels
and positive polysomnography/

multiple sleep latency test are met, but no cataplexy is present
(Criterion B1 not met).

**347.01 (G47.411) Narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin

hypocretin-1 levels are normal (Criterion B2 not met).

**347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and
narcolepsy:** This subtype is caused by exon 21 DNA
(cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-1 mutations and is characterized by
late-onset (age 30--40 years) narcolepsy (with low or intermediate CSF
hypocretin-1 levels), deafness, cerebellar ataxia, and eventually
dementia.

**347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal dominant narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2
diabetes:** Narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes and low CSF
hypocretin-1 levels have been described in rare cases and are associated
with a mutation in the myelin oligodendro-cyte glycoprotein gene.

**347.10 (G47.429)** **Narcolepsy secondary to another medical
condition:** This subtype is for narcolepsy that develops secondary to
medical conditions that cause infectious (e.g., Whipple's disease,
sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral destruction of hypocretin neurons.

**Coding note** (for ICD-9-CM code 347.10 only): Code first the
underlying medical condition (e.g., 040.2 Whipple's disease; 347.10
narcolepsy secondary to Whipple's disease).

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Infrequent cataplexy (less than once per week), need for naps
only once or twice per day, and less disturbed nocturnal sleep.

**Moderate:** Cataplexy once daily or every few days, disturbed
nocturnal sleep, and need for multiple naps daily.

**Severe:** Drug-resistant cataplexy with multiple attacks daily, nearly
constant sleepiness, and disturbed nocturnal sleep (i.e., movements,
insomnia, and vivid dreaming).

Subtypes

In narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency, unclear
"cataplexy-like"

symptoms may be reported (e.g., the symptoms are not triggered by
emotions and are unusually long lasting). In extremely rare cases,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hypocretin-1 are low, and
polysomnographic/multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results are
negative: repeating the test is advised before establishing the subtype
diagnosis. In narco-

Sleep-Wake Disorders

lepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency, test results for
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1\*06:02 may be negative. Seizures,
falls of other origin, and conversion disorder (functional neurological
symptom disorder) should be excluded. In narcolepsy secondary to
infectious (e.g., Whipple's disease, sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral
destruction of hypocretin neurons, test results for HLA DQB1\*06:02 may
be positive and may result from the insult triggering the autoimmune
process. In other cases, the destruction of hypocretin neurons may be
secondary to trauma or hypothalamic surgery. Head trauma or infections
of the central nervous system can, however, produce transitory decreases
in CSF hypocretin-1 levels without hypocretin cell loss, complicating
the diagnosis.

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of sleepiness in narcolepsy are recurrent daytime
naps or lapses into sleep. Sleepiness typically occurs daily but must
occur at a minimum three times a week for at least 3 months (Criterion
A). Narcolepsy generally produces cataplexy, which most commonly
presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden, bilateral
loss of muscle tone precipitated by emotions, typically laughing and
joking. Muscles affected may include those of the neck, jaw, arms, legs,
or whole body, resulting in head bobbing, jaw dropping, or complete
falls. Individuals are awake and aware during cataplexy. To meet
Criterion B1(a), cataplexy must be triggered by laughter or joking and
must occur at least a few times per month when the condition is
untreated or in the past.

Cataplexy should not be confused with "weakness" occurring in the
context of athletic activities (physiological) or exclusively after
unusual emotional triggers such as stress or anxiety (suggesting
possible psychopathology). Episodes lasting hours or days, or those not
triggered by emotions, are unlikely to be cataplexy, nor is rolling on
the floor while laughing hysterically.

In children close to onset, genuine cataplexy can be atypical, affecting
primarily the face, causing grimaces or jaw opening with tongue
thrusting ("cataplectic faces"). Alternatively, cataplexy may present as
low-grade continuous hypotonia, yielding a wobbling walk. In these
cases, Criterion B1(b) can be met in children or in individuals within 6
months of a rapid onset.

Narcolepsy-cataplexy nearly always results from the loss of hypothalamic
hypocretin (orexin)--producing cells, causing hypocretin deficiency
(less than or equal to one-third of control values, or 110 pg/mL in most
laboratories). Cell loss is likely autoimmune, and approximately 99% of
affected individuals carry HLA-DQB1\*06:02 (vs. 12%--38% of control
subjects). Thus, checking for the presence of DQB1\*06:02 prior to a
lumbar puncture for evaluation of CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity may
be useful. Rarely, low CSF levels of hypocretin-1 occur without
cataplexy, notably in youths who may develop cataplexy later. CSF

hypocretin-1 measurement represents the gold standard, excepting
associated severe conditions (neurological, inflammatory, infectious,
trauma) that can interfere with the assay.

A nocturnal polysomnographic sleep study followed by an MSLT can also be
used to confirm the diagnosis (Criterion B3). These tests must be
performed after the individual has stopped all psychotropic medications,
following 2 weeks of adequate sleep time (as documented with sleep
diaries, actigraphy). Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency
(sleep-onset REM period, REM latency less than or equal to 15 minutes)
during polysomnography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and meets
Criterion B3. Alternatively, the MSLT result must be positive, showing a
mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes and two or more
sleep-onset REM periods in four to five naps.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

When sleepiness is severe, automatic behaviors may occur, with the
individual continuing his or her activities in a semi-automatic,
hazelike fashion without memory or consciousness. Approximately 20%--60%
of individuals experience vivid hypnagogic hallucinations

[]{#index_split_030.html#p420}Narcolepsy

**375**

before or upon falling asleep or hypnopompic hallucinations just after
awakening. These hallucinations are distinct from the less vivid,
nonhallucinatory dreamlike mentation at sleep onset that occurs in
normal sleepers. Nightmares and vivid dreaming are also frequent in
narcolepsy, as is REM sleep behavior disorder. Approximately 20%--60% of
individuals experience sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or awakening,
leaving them awake but unable to move or speak. However, many normal
sleepers also report sleep paralysis, especially with stress or sleep
deprivation. Nocturnal eating may occur. Obesity is common. Nocturnal
sleep disruption with frequent long or short awakenings is common and
can be disabling.

Individuals may appear sleepy or fall asleep in the waiting area or
during clinical examination. During cataplexy, individuals may slump in
a chair and have slurred speech or drooping eyelids. If the clinician
has time to check reflexes during cataplexy (most attacks are less than
10 seconds), reflexes are abolished---an important finding
distinguishing genuine cataplexy from conversion disorder.

Prevalence

Narcolepsy-cataplexy affects 0.02%--0.04% of the general population in
most countries.

Narcolepsy affects both genders, with possibly a slight male
preponderance.

Development and Course

Onset is typically in children and adolescents/young adults but rarely
in older adults.

Two peaks of onset are suggested, at ages 15--25 years and ages 30--35
years. Onset can be abrupt or progressive (over years). Severity is
highest when onset is abrupt in children, and then decreases with age or
with treatment, so that symptoms such as cataplexy can occasionally
disappear. Abrupt onset in young, prepubescent children can be
associated with obesity and premature puberty, a phenotype more
frequently observed since 2009. In adolescents, onset is more difficult
to pinpoint. Onset in adults is often unclear, with some individuals
reporting having had excessive sleepiness since birth. Once the disorder
has manifested, the course is persistent and lifelong.

In 90% of cases, the first symptom to manifest is sleepiness or
increased sleep, followed by cataplexy (within 1 year in 50% of cases,
within 3 years in 85%). Sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, vivid
dreaming, and REM sleep behavior disorder (excessive movements during
REM sleep) are early symptoms. Excessive sleep rapidly progresses to an
inability to stay awake during the day, and to maintain good sleep at
night, without a clear increase in total 24-hour sleep needs. In the
first months, cataplexy may be atypical, especially in children. Sleep
paralysis usually develops around puberty in children with prepubertal
onset. Exacerbations of symptoms suggest lack of compliance with
medications or development of a concurrent sleep disorder, notably sleep
apnea.

Young children and adolescents with narcolepsy often develop aggression
or behavioral problems secondary to sleepiness and/or nighttime sleep
disruption. Workload and social pressure increase through high school
and college, reducing available sleep time at night. Pregnancy does not
seem to modify symptoms consistently. After retirement, individuals
typically have more opportunity for napping, reducing the need for
stimulants.

Maintaining a regular schedule benefits individuals at all ages.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Parasomnias, such as sleepwalking, bruxism, REM sleep behavior disorder,
and enuresis, may be more common in individuals who develop narcolepsy.
Individuals commonly report that they need more sleep than other family
members.

Environmental.

Group A streptococcal throat infection, influenza (notably pandemic H1N1
2009), or other winter infections are likely triggers of the autoimmune
process, pro-

[]{#index_split_030.html#p421}**376**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

ducing narcolepsy a few months later. Head trauma and abrupt changes in
sleep-wake patterns (e.g., job changes, stress) may be additional
triggers.

Genetic and physiological.

Monozygotic twins are 25%--32% concordant for narcolepsy.

The prevalence of narcolepsy is 1%--2% in first-degree relatives (a
10-to 40-fold increase overall). Narcolepsy is strongly associated with
DQB1\*06:02 (99% vs. 12%--38% in control subjects of various ethnic
groups; 25% in the general U.S. population). DQB1\*03:01 increases,
while DQB1\*05:01, DQB1\*06:01, and DQB1\*06:03 reduce risk in the
presence of DQB1\*06:02, but the effect is small. Polymorphisms within
the T-cell receptor alpha gene and other immune modulating genes also
modulate risk slightly.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Narcolepsy has been described in all ethnic groups and in many cultures.
Among African Americans, more cases present without cataplexy or with
atypical cataplexy, complicating diagnosis, especially in the presence
of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.

Diagnostic Markers

Functional imaging suggests impaired hypothalamic responses to humorous
stimuli.

Nocturnal polysomnography followed by an MSLT is used to confirm the
diagnosis of narcolepsy, especially when the disorder is first being
diagnosed and before treatment has begun, and if hypocretin deficiency
has not been documented biochemically. The polysomnography/MSLT should
be performed after the individual is no longer taking any psychotropic
drugs and after regular sleep-wake patterns, without shift work or sleep
deprivation, have been documented.

A sleep-onset REM period during the polysomnography (REM sleep latency
less than or equal to 15 minutes) is highly specific (approximately 1%
positive in control subjects) but moderately sensitive (approximately
50%). A positive MSLT result displays an average sleep latency of less
than or equal to 8 minutes, and sleep-onset REM periods in two or more
naps on a four-or five-nap test. The MSLT result is positive in 90%--95%
of individuals with narcolepsy versus 2%--4% of control subjects or
individuals with other sleep disorders. Additional polysomnographic
findings often include frequent arousals, decreased sleep efficiency,
and increased stage 1 sleep. Periodic limb movements (found in about 40%
of individuals with narcolepsy) and sleep apnea are often noted.

Hypocretin deficiency is demonstrated by measuring CSF hypocretin-1
immunoreactivity. The test is particularly useful in individuals with
suspected conversion disorder and those without typical cataplexy, or in
treatment-refractory cases. The diagnostic value of the test is not
affected by medications, sleep deprivation, or circadian time, but the
findings are uninterpretable when the individual is severely ill with a
concurrent infection or head trauma or is comatose. CSF cytology,
protein, and glucose are within normal range even when sampled within
weeks of rapid onset. CSF hypocretin-1 in these incipient cases is
typically already very diminished or undetectable.

Functional Consequences of Narcolepsy

Driving and working are impaired, and individuals with narcolepsy should
avoid jobs that place themselves (e.g., working with machinery) or
others (e.g., bus driver, pilot) in danger. Once the narcolepsy is
controlled with therapy, patients can usually drive, although rarely
long distances alone. Untreated individuals are also at risk for social
isolation and accidental injury to themselves or others. Social
relations may suffer as these individuals strive to avert cataplexy by
exerting control over emotions.

Differential Diagnosis

Other hypersomnias.

Hypersomnolence and narcolepsy are similar with respect to the degree of
daytime sleepiness, age at onset, and stable course over time but can be
distin-

[]{#index_split_030.html#p422}Narcolepsy

**377**

guished based on distinctive clinical and laboratory features.
Individuals with hypersomnolence typically have longer and less
disrupted nocturnal sleep, greater difficulty awakening, more persistent
daytime sleepiness (as opposed to more discrete "sleep attacks" in
narcolepsy), longer and less refreshing daytime sleep episodes, and
little or no dreaming during daytime naps. By contrast, individuals with
narcolepsy have cataplexy and recurrent intrusions of elements of REM
sleep into the transition between sleep and wakefulness (e.g.,
sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The MSLT typically
demonstrates shorter sleep latencies (i.e., greater physiological
sleepiness) as well as the presence of multiple sleep-onset REM periods
in individuals with narcolepsy.

Sleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep.

Sleep deprivation and insufficient

nocturnal sleep are common in adolescents and shift workers. In
adolescents, difficulties falling asleep at night are common, causing
sleep deprivation. The MSLT result may be positive if conducted while
the individual is sleep deprived or while his or her sleep is phase
delayed.

Sleep apnea syndromes.

Sleep apneas are especially likely in the presence of obesity.

Because obstructive sleep apnea is more frequent than narcolepsy,
cataplexy may be overlooked (or absent), and the individual is assumed
to have obstructive sleep apnea unresponsive to usual therapies.

Major depressive disorder.

Narcolepsy or hypersomnia may be associated or confused with depression.
Cataplexy is not present in depression. The MSLT results are most often
normal, and there is dissociation between subjective and objective
sleepiness, as measured by the mean sleep latency during the MSLT.

Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).

Atypical features,

such as long-lasting cataplexy or unusual triggers, may be present in
conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).
Individuals may report sleeping and dreaming, yet the MSLT does not show
the characteristic sleep-onset REM period. Full-blown, long-lasting
pseudocataplexy may occur during consultation, allowing the examining
physician enough time to verify reflexes, which remain intact.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or other behavioral problems.

In children and

adolescents, sleepiness can cause behavioral problems, including
aggressiveness and inattention, leading to a misdiagnosis of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Seizures.

In young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as seizures. Seizures
are not commonly triggered by emotions, and when they are, the trigger
is not usually laughing or joking. During a seizure, individuals are
more likely to hurt themselves when falling. Seizures characterized by
isolated atonia are rarely seen in isolation of other seizures, and they
also have signatures on the electroencephalogram.

Chorea and movement disorders.

In young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as

chorea or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated
with streptococcal infections, especially in the context of a strep
throat infection and high antistreptolysin O

antibody levels. Some children may have an overlapping movement disorder
close to onset of the cataplexy.

Schizophrenia.

In the presence of florid and vivid hypnagogic hallucinations,
individuals may think these experiences are real---a feature that
suggests schizophrenia. Similarly, with stimulant treatment, persecutory
delusions may develop. If cataplexy is present, the clinician should
first assume that these symptoms are secondary to narcolepsy before
considering a co-occurring diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Comorbidity

Narcolepsy can co-occur with bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders,
and in rare cases with schizophrenia. Narcolepsy is also associated with
increased body mass index or obe-

Sleep-Wake Disorders

sity, especially when the narcolepsy is untreated. Rapid weight gain is
common in young children with a sudden disease onset. Comorbid sleep
apnea should be considered if there is a sudden aggravation of
preexisting narcolepsy.

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

The *International Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd Edition
(ICSD-2), differentiates five subtypes of narcolepsy.

**Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders**

The breathing-related sleep disorders category encompasses three
relatively distinct disorders: obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central
sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea

Diagnostic Criteria

**327.23 (G47.33)**

A. Either (1) or (2):

1\. Evidence by polysomnography of at least five obstructive apneas or
hypopneas per hour of sleep and either of the following sleep symptoms:
a. Nocturnal breathing disturbances: snoring, snorting/gasping, or
breathing pauses during sleep.

b\. Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite
sufficient opportunities to sleep that is not better explained by
another mental disorder (including a sleep disorder) and is not
attributable to another medical condition.

2\. Evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more obstructive apneas and/or
hypopneas per hour of sleep regardless of accompanying symptoms.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Apnea hypopnea index is less than 15.

**Moderate:** Apnea hypopnea index is 15--30.

**Severe:** Apnea hypopnea index is greater than 30.

Specifiers

Disease severity is measured by a count of the number of apneas plus
hypopneas per hour of sleep (apnea hypopnea index) using polysomnography
or other overnight monitoring.

Overall severity is also informed by levels of nocturnal desaturation
and sleep fragmentation (measured by brain cortical arousal frequency
and sleep stages) and degree of associated symptoms and daytime
impairment. However, the exact number and thresholds may vary according
to the specific measurement techniques used, and these numbers may
change over time. Regardless of the apnea hypopnea index (count) per se,
the disorder is considered to be more severe when apneas and hypopneas
are accompanied by significant oxygen hemoglobin desaturation (e.g.,
when more than 10% of the sleep time is spent at desaturation levels of
less than 90%) or when sleep is severely fragmented as shown by an
[]{#index_split_030.html#p424}Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea

**379**

elevated arousal index (arousal index greater than 30) or reduced stages
in deep sleep (e.g., percentage stage N3 \[slow-wave sleep\] less than
5%).

Diagnostic Features

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is the most common breathing-related
sleep disorder.

It is characterized by repeated episodes of upper (pharyngeal) airway
obstruction (apneas and hypopneas) during sleep. *Apnea* refers to the
total absence of airflow, and *hypopnea* refers to a reduction in
airflow. Each apnea or hypopnea represents a reduction in breathing of
at least 10 seconds in duration in adults or two missed breaths in
children and is typically associated with drops in oxygen saturation of
3% or greater and/or an electroencephalographic arousal. Both
sleep-related (nocturnal) and wake-time symptoms are common.

The cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are snoring
and daytime sleepiness.

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea in adults is diagnosed on the basis of
polysomnographic findings and symptoms. The diagnosis is based on
symptoms of 1) nocturnal breathing disturbances (i.e., snoring,
snorting/gasping, breathing pauses during sleep), or 2) daytime
sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient
opportunities to sleep that are not better explained by another mental
disorder and not attributable to another medical condition, along with
3) evidence by polysomnography of five or more obstructive apneas or
hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A1). Diagnosis can be made in the
absence of these symptoms if there is evidence by polysomnography of 15
or more obstructive apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion
A2).

Specific attention to disturbed sleep occurring in association with
snoring or breathing pauses and physical findings that increase risk of
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., central obesity, crowded
pharyngeal airway, elevated blood pressure) is needed to reduce the
chance of misdiagnosing this treatable condition.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Because of the frequency of nocturnal awakenings that occur with
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, individuals may report symptoms of
insomnia. Other common, though nonspecific, symptoms of obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea are heartburn, nocturia, morning headaches, dry
mouth, erectile dysfunction, and reduced libido. Rarely, individuals may
complain of difficulty breathing while lying supine or sleeping.
Hypertension may occur in more than 60% of individuals with obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea.

Prevalence

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is a very common disorder, affecting at
least 1%--2% of children, 2%--15% of middle-age adults, and more than
20% of older individuals. In the general community, prevalence rates of
undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be very high in elderly
individuals. Since the disorder is strongly associated with obesity,
increases in obesity rates are likely to be accompanied by an increased
prevalence of this disorder. Prevalence may be particularly high among
males, older adults, and certain racial/ethnic groups. In adults, the
male-to-female ratio of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea ranges from 2:1
to 4:1. Gender differences decline in older age, possibly because of an
increased prevalence in females after menopause. There is no gender
difference among prepubertal children.

Development and Course

The age distribution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea likely follows
a J-shaped distribution. There is a peak in children ages 3--8 years
when the nasopharynx may be compromised by a relatively large mass of
tonsillar tissue compared with the size of the upper

[]{#index_split_030.html#p425}**380**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

airway. With growth of the airway and regression of lymphoid tissue
during later childhood, there is reduction in prevalence. Then, as
obesity prevalence increases in midlife and females enter menopause,
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea again increases. The course in older
age is unclear; the disorder may level off after age 65 years, but in
other individuals, prevalence may increase with aging. Because there is
some age dependency of the occurrence of apneas and hypopneas,
polysomnographic results must be interpreted in light of other clinical
data. In particular, significant clinical symptoms of insomnia or
hypersomnia should be investigated regardless of the individual's age.

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea usually has an insidious onset, gradual
progression, and persistent course. Typically the loud snoring has been
present for many years, often since childhood, but an increase in its
severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation. Weight gain may
precipitate an increase in symptoms. Although obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea can occur at any age, it most commonly manifests among
individuals ages 40--60 years. Over 4--5 years, the average apnea
hypopnea index increases in adults and older individuals by
approximately two apneas/hypopneas per hour. The apnea hypopnea index is
increased and incident obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is greater among
individuals who are older, who are male, or who have a higher baseline
body mass index (BMI) or increase their BMI over time.

Spontaneous resolution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has been
reported with weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgery. In
children, seasonal variation in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has
been observed, as has improvement with overall growth.

In young children, the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea may be more subtle than in adults, making diagnosis more
difficult to establish. Polysomnography is useful in confirming
diagnosis. Evidence of fragmentation of sleep on the polysomnogram may
not be as apparent as in studies of older individuals, possibly because
of the high homeostatic drive in young individuals. Symptoms such as
snoring are usually parent-reported and thus have reduced sensitivity.
Agitated arousals and unusual sleep postures, such as sleeping on the
hands and knees, may occur. Nocturnal enuresis also may occur and should
raise the suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea if it recurs in
a child who was previously dry at night. Children may also manifest
excessive daytime sleepiness, although this is not as common or
pronounced as in adults. Daytime mouth breathing, difficulty in
swallowing, and poor speech articulation are also common features in
children. Children younger than 5 years more often present with
nighttime symptoms, such as observed apneas or labored breathing, than
with behavioral symptoms (i.e., the nighttime symptoms are more
noticeable and more often bring the child to clinical attention). In
children older than 5 years, daytime symptoms such as sleepiness and
behavioral problems (e.g., impulsivity and hyperactivity),
attention-deficit/

hyperactivity disorder, learning difficulties, and morning headaches are
more often the focus of concern. Children with obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea also may present with failure to thrive and developmental
delays. In young children, obesity is a less common risk factor, while
delayed growth and "failure to thrive" may be present.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

The major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are obesity
and male gender. Others include maxillary-mandibular retrognathia or
micro-gnathia, positive family history of sleep apnea, genetic syndromes
that reduce upper airway patency (e.g., Down's syndrome, Treacher
Collin's syndrome), adenotonsillar hypertrophy (especially in young
children), menopause (in females), and various endocrine syndromes
(e.g., acromegaly). Compared with premenopausal females, males are at
increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, possibly reflecting
the influences of sex hormones on ventilatory control and body fat
distribution, as well as because of gender differences in airway
structure. Medications for mental disorders and medical conditions that
tend to induce somnolence may worsen the course of apnea symptoms if
these medications are not managed carefully.

[]{#index_split_030.html#p426}Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea

**381**

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has a strong genetic basis, as
evidenced by the significant familial aggregation of the apnea hypopnea
index. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is
approximately twice as high among the first-degree relatives of probands
with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea as compared with members of
control families. One-third of the variance in the apnea hypopnea index
is explained by shared familial factors. Although genetic markers with
diagnostic or prognostic value are not yet available for use, eliciting
a family history of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea should increase the
clinical suspicion for the disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

There is a potential for sleepiness and fatigue to be reported
differently across cultures. In some groups, snoring may be considered a
sign of health and thus may not trigger concerns. Individuals of Asian
ancestry may be at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea
despite relatively low BMI, possibly reflecting the influence of
craniofacial risk factors that narrow the nasopharynx.

Gender-Related Issues

Females may more commonly report fatigue rather than sleepiness and may
underreport snoring.

Diagnostic Markers

Polysomnography provides quantitative data on frequency of sleep-related
respiratory disturbances and associated changes in oxygen saturation and
sleep continuity. Polysomnographic findings in children differ from
those in adults in that children demonstrate labored breathing, partial
obstructive hypoventilation with cyclical desaturations, hypercapnia and
paradoxical movements. Apnea hypopnea index levels as low as 2 are used
to define thresholds of abnormality in children.

Arterial blood gas measurements while the individual is awake are
usually normal, but some individuals can have waking hypoxemia or
hypercapnia. This pattern should alert the clinician to the possibility
of coexisting lung disease or hypoventilation. Imaging procedures may
reveal narrowing of the upper airway. Cardiac testing may show evidence
of impaired ventricular function. Individuals with severe nocturnal
oxygen desaturation may also have elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit
values. Validated sleep measures (e.g., multiple sleep latency test
\[MSLT\], maintenance of wakefulness test) may identify sleepiness.

Functional Consequences of

Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea

More than 50% of individuals with moderate to severe obstructive sleep
apnea hypopnea report symptoms of daytime sleepiness. A twofold
increased risk of occupational accidents has been reported in
association with symptoms of snoring and sleepiness. Motor vehicle
crashes also have been reported to be as much as sevenfold higher among
individuals with elevated apnea hypopnea index values. Clinicians should
be cognizant of state government requirements for reporting this
disorder, especially in relationship to commercial drivers. Reduced
scores on measures of health-related quality of life are common in
individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, with the largest
decrements observed in the physical and vitality subscales.

Differential Diagnosis

Primary snoring and other sleep disorders.

Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea

hypopnea must be differentiated from individuals with primary snoring
(i.e., otherwise

[]{#index_split_030.html#p427}**382**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

asymptomatic individuals who snore and do not have abnormalities on
overnight polysomnography). Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea may additionally report nocturnal gasping and choking. The
presence of sleepiness or other daytime symptoms not explained by other
etiologies suggests the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea,
but this differentiation requires polysomnography. Definitive
differential diagnosis between hypersomnia, central sleep apnea,
sleep-related hypoventilation, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also
requires polysomnographic studies.

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be differentiated from other
causes of sleepiness, such as narcolepsy, hypersomnia, and circadian
rhythm sleep disorders. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can be
differentiated from narcolepsy by the absence of cataplexy,
sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis and by the presence of
loud snoring, gasping during sleep, or observed apneas in sleep. Daytime
sleep episodes in narcolepsy are characteristically shorter, more
refreshing, and more often associated with dreaming.

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea shows characteristic apneas and
hypopneas and oxygen desaturation during nocturnal polysomnographic
studies. Narcolepsy results in multiple sleep-onset rapid eye movement
(REM) periods during the MSLT. Narcolepsy, like obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea, may be associated with obesity, and some individuals have
concurrent narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. A diagnosis
of narcolepsy does not exclude the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea, as the two conditions may co-occur.

Insomnia disorder.

For individuals complaining of difficulty initiating or maintaining
sleep or early-morning awakenings, insomnia disorder can be
differentiated from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea by the absence of
snoring and the absence of the history, signs, and symptoms
characteristic of the latter disorder. However, insomnia and obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea may coexist, and if so, both disorders may need to
be addressed concurrently to improve sleep.

Panic attacks.

Nocturnal panic attacks may include symptoms of gasping or choking
during sleep that may be difficult to distinguish clinically from
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. However, the lower frequency of
episodes, intense autonomic arousal, and lack of excessive sleepiness
differentiate nocturnal panic attacks from obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea. Polysomnography in individuals with nocturnal panic attacks
does not reveal the typical pattern of apneas or oxygen desaturation
characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Individuals with
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea do not provide a history of daytime
panic attacks.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children may include
symptoms of inattention, academic impairment, hyperactivity, and
internalizing behaviors, all of which may also be symptoms of childhood
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. The presence of other symptoms and
signs of childhood obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., labored
breathing or snoring during sleep and adenotonsillar hypertrophy) would
suggest the presence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may
commonly co-occur, and there may be causal links between them;
therefore, risk factors such as enlarged tonsils, obesity, or a family
history of sleep apnea may help alert the clinician to their
co-occurrence.

Substance/medication-induced insomnia or hypersomnia.

Substance use and substance

withdrawal (including medications) can produce insomnia or hypersomnia.
A careful history is usually sufficient to identify the relevant
substance/medication, and follow-up shows improvement of the sleep
disturbance after discontinuation of the substance/medication. In other
cases, the use of a substance/medication (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates,
benzodiazepines, tobacco) has been shown to exacerbate obstructive sleep
apnea hypopnea.

An individual with symptoms and signs consistent with obstructive sleep
apnea hypop-

[]{#index_split_030.html#p428}Central Sleep Apnea

**383**

nea should receive that diagnosis, even in the presence of concurrent
substance use that is exacerbating the condition.

Comorbidity

Systemic hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke,
diabetes, and increased mortality are consistently associated with
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Risk estimates vary from 30% to as
much as 300% for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.
Evidence of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure (e.g., cor
pulmonale, ankle edema, hepatic congestion) are rare in obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea and when present indicate either very severe
disease or associated hypoventilation or cardiopulmonary comorbidities.
Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may occur with increased frequency
in association with a number of medical or neurological conditions
(e.g., cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease). Physical findings
reflect the co-occurrence of these conditions.

As many as one-third of individuals referred for evaluation of
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea report symptoms of depression, with as
many of 10% having depression scores consistent with moderate to severe
depression. Severity of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as measured by
the apnea hypopnea index, has been found to be correlated with severity
of symptoms of depression. This association may be stronger in males
than in females.

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

The *International Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd Edition
(ICSD-2), differentiates 11 subtypes of "sleep-related breathing
disorders," including primary central sleep apnea, obstructive sleep
apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation.

Central Sleep Apnea

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Evidence by polysomnography of five or more central apneas per hour
of sleep.

B. The disorder is not better explained by another current sleep
disorder.

*Specify* whether:

**327.21 (G47.31) Idiopathic central sleep apnea:** Characterized by
repeated episodes of apneas and hypopneas during sleep caused by
variability in respiratory effort but without evidence of airway
obstruction.

**786.04 (R06.3) Cheyne-Stokes breathing:** A pattern of periodic
crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central
apneas and hypopneas at a frequency of at least five events per hour,
accompanied by frequent arousal.

[]{#index_split_031.html}

**780.57 (G47.37) Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use:** The
pathogenesis of this subtype is attributed to the effects of opioids on
the respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as well as the
differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapnic respiratory drive.

**Coding note** (for 780.57 \[G47.37\] code only): When an opioid use
disorder is present, first code the opioid use disorder: 305.50 (F11.10)
mild opioid use disorder or 304.00 (F11.20) moderate or severe opioid
use disorder; then code 780.57 (G47.37) central sleep apnea comorbid
with opioid use. When an opioid use disorder is not present (e.g., after
a one-time heavy use of the substance), code only 780.57 (G47.37)
central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p429}**384**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

**Note:** See the section "Diagnostic Features" in text.

*Specify* current severity:

Severity of central sleep apnea is graded according to the frequency of
the breathing disturbances as well as the extent of associated oxygen
desaturation and sleep fragmentation that occur as a consequence of
repetitive respiratory disturbances.

Subtypes

Idiopathic central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes breathing are
characterized by increased gain of the ventilatory control system, also
referred to as *high loop gain,* which leads to instability in
ventilation and PaCO2 levels. This instability is termed *periodic
breathing* and can be recognized by hyperventilation alternating with
hypoventilation. Individuals with these disorders typically have pCO2
levels while awake that are slightly hypocapneic or normocapneic.
Central sleep apnea may also manifest during initiation of treatment of
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or may occur in association with
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (termed *complex sleep
apnea*). The occurrence of central sleep apnea in association with
obstructive sleep apnea is also considered to be due to high loop gain.
In contrast, the pathogenesis of central sleep apnea comorbid with
opioid use has been attributed to the effects of opioids on the
respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as well as to its
differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapneic respiratory drive.
These individuals may have elevated pCO2 levels while awake. Individuals
receiving chronic methadone maintenance therapy have been noted to have
increased somnolence and depression, although the role of breathing
disorders associated with opioid medication in causing these problems
has not been studied.

Specifiers

An increase in the central apnea index (i.e., number of central apneas
per hour of sleep) reflects an increase in severity of central sleep
apnea. Sleep continuity and quality may be markedly impaired with
reductions in restorative stages of non--rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
(i.e., decreased slow-wave sleep \[stage N3\]). In individuals with
severe Cheyne-Stokes breathing, the pattern can also be observed during
resting wakefulness, a finding that is thought to be a poor prognostic
marker for mortality.

Diagnostic Features

Central sleep apnea disorders are characterized by repeated episodes of
apneas and hypopneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory
effort. These are disorders of ventilatory control in which respiratory
events occur in a periodic or intermittent pattern.

*Idiopathic central sleep apnea* is characterized by sleepiness,
insomnia, and awakenings due to dyspnea in association with five or more
central apneas per hour of sleep. Central sleep apnea occurring in
individuals with heart failure, stroke, or renal failure typically have
a breathing pattern called *Cheyne-Stokes breathing,* which is
characterized by a pattern of periodic crescendo-decrescendo variation
in tidal volume that results in central apneas and hypopneas occurring
at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompanied by
frequent arousals. Central and obstructive sleep apneas may coexist; the
ratio of central to obstructive apneas/hypopneas may be used to identify
which condition is predominant.

Alterations in neuromuscular control of breathing can occur in
association with medications or substances used in individuals with
mental health conditions, which can cause or exacerbate impairments of
respiratory rhythm and ventilation. Individuals taking these medications
have a sleep-related breathing disorder that could contribute to sleep
disturbances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confusion, and depression.
Specifically, *chronic* []{#index_split_031.html#p430}Central Sleep
Apnea

**385**

*use of long-acting opioid medications* is often associated with
impairment of respiratory control leading to central sleep apnea.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with central sleep apnea hypopneas can manifest with
sleepiness or insomnia.

There can be complaints of sleep fragmentation, including awakening with
dyspnea.

Some individuals are asymptomatic. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can
coexist with Cheyne-Stokes breathing, and thus snoring and abruptly
terminating apneas may be observed during sleep.

Prevalence

The prevalence of idiopathic central sleep apnea is unknown but thought
to be rare. The prevalence of Cheyne-Stokes breathing is high in
individuals with depressed cardiac ventricular ejection fraction. In
individuals with an ejection fraction of less than 45%, the prevalence
has been reported to be 20% or higher. The male-to-female ratio for
prevalence is even more highly skewed toward males than for obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea. Prevalence increases with age, and most patients
are older than 60 years. Cheyne-Stokes breathing occurs in approximately
20% of individuals with acute stroke. Central sleep apnea comorbid with
opioid use occurs in approximately 30% of individuals taking chronic
opioids for nonmalignant pain and similarly in individuals receiving
methadone maintenance therapy.

Development and Course

The onset of Cheyne-Stokes breathing appears tied to the development of
heart failure. The Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern is associated with
oscillations in heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen desaturation, and
elevated sympathetic nervous system activity that can promote
progression of heart failure. The clinical significance of Cheyne-Stokes
breathing in the setting of stroke is not known, but Cheyne-Stokes
breathing may be a transient finding that resolves with time after acute
stroke. Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use has been documented
with chronic use (i.e., several months).

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Cheyne-Stokes breathing is frequently present in individuals with heart
failure. The coexistence of atrial fibrillation further increases risk,
as do older age and male gender. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is also seen in
association with acute stroke and possibly renal failure. The underlying
ventilatory instability in the setting of heart failure has been
attributed to increased ventilatory chemosensitivity and
hyperventilation due to pulmonary vascular congestion and circulatory
delay. Central sleep apnea is seen in individuals taking long-acting
opioids.

Diagnostic Markers

Physical findings seen in individuals with a Cheyne-Stokes breathing
pattern relate to its risk factors. Findings consistent with heart
failure, such as jugular venous distension, S3

heart sound, lung crackles, and lower extremity edema, may be present.
Polysomnography is used to characterize the breathing characteristics of
each breathing-related sleep disorder subtype. Central sleep apneas are
recorded when periods of breathing cessation for longer than 10 seconds
occur. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by a pattern of periodic
crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central
apneas and hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events
per hour that are accompanied by frequent arousals. The cycle length of
Cheyne-Stokes breathing (or time from end of one central apnea to the
end of the next apnea) is about 60 seconds.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p431}**386**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Functional Consequences of Central Sleep Apnea

Idiopathic central sleep apnea has been reported to cause symptoms of
disrupted sleep, including insomnia and sleepiness. Cheyne-Stokes
breathing with comorbid heart failure has been associated with excessive
sleepiness, fatigue, and insomnia, although many individuals may be
asymptomatic. Coexistence of heart failure and Cheyne-Stokes breathing
may be associated with increased cardiac arrhythmias and increased
mortality or cardiac transplantation. Individuals with central sleep
apnea comorbid with opioid use may present with symptoms of sleepiness
or insomnia.

Differential Diagnosis

Idiopathic central sleep apnea must be distinguished from other
breathing-related sleep disorders, other sleep disorders, and medical
conditions and mental disorders that cause sleep fragmentation,
sleepiness, and fatigue. This is achieved using polysomnography.

Other breathing-related sleep disorders and sleep disorders.

Central sleep apnea can

be distinguished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea by the presence
of at least five central apneas per hour of sleep. These conditions may
co-occur, but central sleep apnea is considered to predominate when the
ratio of central to obstructive respiratory events exceeds 50%.

Cheyne-Stokes breathing can be distinguished from other mental
disorders, including other sleep disorders, and other medical conditions
that cause sleep fragmentation, sleepiness, and fatigue based on the
presence of a predisposing condition (e.g., heart failure or stroke) and
signs and polysomnographic evidence of the characteristic breathing
pattern.

Polysomnographic respiratory findings can help distinguish Cheyne-Stokes
breathing from insomnia due to other medical conditions. High-altitude
periodic breathing has a pattern that resembles Cheyne-Stokes breathing
but has a shorter cycle time, occurs only at high altitude, and is not
associated with heart failure.

Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use can be differentiated from
other types of breathing-related sleep disorders based on the use of
long-acting opioid medications in conjunction with polysomnographic
evidence of central apneas and periodic or ataxic breathing. It can be
distinguished from insomnia due to drug or substance use based on
polysomnographic evidence of central sleep apnea.

Comorbidity

Central sleep apnea disorders are frequently present in users of
long-acting opioids, such as methadone. Individuals taking these
medications have a sleep-related breathing disorder that could
contribute to sleep disturbances and symptoms such as sleepiness,
confusion, and depression. While the individual is asleep, breathing
patterns such as central apneas, periodic apneas, and ataxic breathing
may be observed. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may coexist with
central sleep apnea, and features consistent with this condition can
also be present (see "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea" earlier in this
chapter).

Cheyne-Stokes breathing is more commonly observed in association with
conditions that include heart failure, stroke, and renal failure and is
seen more frequently in individuals with atrial fibrillation.
Individuals with Cheyne-Stokes breathing are more likely to be older, to
be male, and to have lower weight than individuals with obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p432}Sleep-Related Hypoventilation

**387**

Sleep-Related Hypoventilation

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Polysomnograpy demonstrates episodes of decreased respiration
associated with elevated CO2 levels. (**Note:** In the absence of
objective measurement of CO2, persistent low levels of hemoglobin oxygen
saturation unassociated with apneic/hypopneic events may indicate
hypoventilation.)

B. The disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep
disorder.

*Specify* whether:

**327.24 (G47.34) Idiopathic hypoventilation:** This subtype is not
attributable to any readily identified condition.

**327.25 (G47.35) Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation:** This
subtype is a rare congenital disorder in which the individual typically
presents in the perinatal period with shallow breathing, or cyanosis and
apnea during sleep.

**327.26 (G47.36) Comorbid sleep-related hypoventilation:** This subtype
occurs as a consequence of a medical condition, such as a pulmonary
disorder (e.g., interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease) or a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular
dystrophies, postpolio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury,
kyphoscoliosis), or medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates). It
also occurs with obesity (obesity hypoventilation disorder), where it
reflects a combination of increased work of breathing due to reduced
chest wall compliance and ventilation-perfusion mismatch and variably
reduced ventilatory drive. Such individuals usually are characterized by
body mass index of greater than 30 and hypercapnia during wakefulness
(with a pCO2 of greater than 45), without other evidence of
hypoventilation.

*Specify* current severity:

Severity is graded according to the degree of hypoxemia and hypercarbia
present during sleep and evidence of end organ impairment due to these
abnormalities (e.g., right-sided heart failure). The presence of blood
gas abnormalities during wakefulness is an indicator of greater
severity.

Subtypes

Regarding obesity hypoventilation disorder, the prevalence of obesity
hypoventilation in the general population is not known but is thought to
be increasing in association with the increased prevalence of obesity
and extreme obesity.

Diagnostic Features

Sleep-related hypoventilation can occur independently or, more
frequently, comorbid with medical or neurological disorders, medication
use, or substance use disorder. Although symptoms are not mandatory to
make this diagnosis, individuals often report excessive daytime
sleepiness, frequent arousals and awakenings during sleep, morning
headaches, and insomnia complaints.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with sleep-related hypoventilation can present with
sleep-related complaints of insomnia or sleepiness. Episodes of
orthopnea can occur in individuals with diaphragm weakness. Headaches
upon awakening may be present. During sleep, episodes of shallow
breathing may be observed, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or
central sleep apnea may coexist. Consequences of ventilatory
insufficiency, including pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale (right
heart failure), polycythemia, and neurocognitive dysfunction,
[]{#index_split_031.html#p433}**388**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

can be present. With progression of ventilatory insufficiency, blood gas
abnormalities extend into wakefulness. Features of the medical condition
causing sleep-related hypoventilation can also be present. Episodes of
hypoventilation may be associated with frequent arousals or
bradytachycardia. Individuals may complain of excessive sleepiness and
insomnia or morning headaches or may present with findings of
neurocognitive dysfunction or depression. Hypoventilation may not be
present during wakefulness.

Prevalence

Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation in adults is very uncommon. The
prevalence of congenital central alveolar hypoventilation is unknown,
but the disorder is rare. Comorbid sleep-related hypoventilation (i.e.,
hypoventilation comorbid with other conditions, such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease \[COPD\], neuromuscular disorders, or
obesity) is more common.

Development and Course

Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is thought to be a slowly
progressive disorder of respiratory impairment. When this disorder
occurs comorbidly with other disorders (e.g., COPD, neuromuscular
disorders, obesity), disease severity reflects the severity of the
underlying condition, and the disorder progresses as the condition
worsens. Complications such as pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale,
cardiac dysrhythmias, polycythemia, neurocognitive dysfunction, and
worsening respiratory failure can develop with increasing severity of
blood gas abnormalities.

Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation usually manifests at birth
with shallow, erratic, or absent breathing. This disorder can also
manifest during infancy, childhood, and adulthood because of variable
penetrance of the *PHOX2B* mutation. Children with congenital central
alveolar hypoventilation are more likely to have disorders of the
autonomic nervous system, Hirschsprung's disease, neural crest tumors,
and characteristic box-shaped face (i.e., the face is short relative to
its width).

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Ventilatory drive can be reduced in individuals using central nervous
system depressants, including benzodiazepines, opiates, and alcohol.

Genetic and physiological.

Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is associated with reduced
ventilatory drive due to a blunted chemoresponsiveness to CO2 (reduced
respiratory drive; i.e., "won't breathe"), reflecting underlying
neurological deficits in centers governing the control of ventilation.
More commonly, sleep-related hypoventilation is comorbid with another
medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder, a neuromuscular or
chest wall disorder, or hypothyroidism, or with use of medications
(e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates). In these conditions, the
hypoventilation may be a consequence of increased work of breathing
and/or impairment of respiratory muscle function (i.e., "can't breathe")
or reduced respiratory drive (i.e., "won't breathe").

Neuromuscular disorders influence breathing through impairment of
respiratory motor innervation or respiratory muscle function. They
include conditions such as amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord
injury, diaphragmatic paralysis, myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton
syndrome, toxic or metabolic myopathies, postpolio syndrome, and
Char-cot-Marie-Tooth syndrome.

Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation is a genetic disorder
attributable to mutations of *PHOX2B,* a gene that is crucial for the
development of the embryonic autonomic nervous system and neural crest
derivatives. Children with congenital central alveolar hypoventilation
show blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnia, especially in
non--rapid eye movement sleep.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p434}Sleep-Related Hypoventilation

**389**

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Gender distributions for sleep-related hypoventilation occurring in
association with comorbid conditions reflect the gender distributions of
the comorbid conditions. For example, COPD is more frequently present in
males and with increasing age.

Diagnostic Markers

Sleep-related hypoventilation is diagnosed using polysomnography showing
sleep-related hypoxemia and hypercapnia that is not better explained by
another breathing-related sleep disorder. The documentation of increased
arterial pCO2 levels to greater than 55 mmHg during sleep or a 10 mmHg
or greater increase in pCO2 levels (to a level that also exceeds 50
mmHg) during sleep in comparison to awake supine values, for 10 minutes
or longer, is the gold standard for diagnosis. However, obtaining
arterial blood gas determinations during sleep is impractical, and
non-invasive measures of pCO2 have not been adequately validated during
sleep and are not widely used during polysomnography in adults.
Prolonged and sustained decreases in oxygen saturation (oxygen
saturation of less than 90% for more than 5 minutes with a nadir of at
least 85%, or oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least 30% of
sleep time) in the absence of evidence of upper airway obstruction are
often used as an indication of sleep-related hypoventilation; however,
this finding is not specific, as there are other potential causes of
hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease.

Functional Consequences of

Sleep-Related Hypoventilation

The consequences of sleep-related hypoventilation are related to the
effects of chronic exposure to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. These blood
gas derangements cause vasocon-striction of the pulmonary vasculature
leading to pulmonary hypertension, which, if severe, can result in
right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). Hypoxemia can lead to
dysfunction of organs such as the brain, blood, and heart, leading to
outcomes such as cognitive dysfunction, polycythemia, and cardiac
arrhythmias. Hypercapnia can depress ventilatory drive, leading to
progressive respiratory failure.

Differential Diagnosis

Other medical conditions affecting ventilation.

In adults, the idiopathic variety of sleep-related hypoventilation is
very uncommon and is determined by excluding the presence of lung
diseases, skeletal malformations, neuromuscular disorders, and other
medical and neurological disorders or medications that affect
ventilation. Sleep-related hypoventilation must be distinguished from
other causes of sleep-related hypoxemia, such as that due to lung
disease.

Other breathing-related sleep disorders.

Sleep-related hypoventilation can be distinguished from obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea based on clinical features
and findings on polysomnography. Sleep-related hypoventilation typically
shows more sustained periods of oxygen desaturation rather that the
periodic episodes seen in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central
sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea
also show a pattern of discrete episodes of repeated airflow decreases
that can be absent in sleep-related hypoventilation.

Comorbidity

Sleep-related hypoventilation often occurs in association with a
pulmonary disorder (e.g., interstitial lung disease, COPD), with a
neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular dystrophies,
postpolio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury, obesity,
kyphoscoliosis), or,

[]{#index_split_031.html#p435}**390**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

most relevant to the mental health provider, with medication use (e.g.,
benzodiazepines, opiates). Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation
often occurs in association with autonomic dysfunction and may occur in
association with Hirschsprung's disease. COPD, a disorder of lower
airway obstruction usually associated with cigarette smoking, can result
in sleep-related hypoventilation and hypoxemia. The presence of
coexisting obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is thought to exacerbate
hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep and wakefulness. The relationship
between congenital central alveolar hypoventilation and idiopathic
sleep-related hypoventilation is unclear; in some individuals,
idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation may represent cases of
late-onset congenital central alveolar hypoventilation.

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

The *International Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd Edition
(ICSD-2), combines sleep-related hypoventilation and sleep-related
hypoxemia under the category of sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic
syndromes. This approach to classification reflects the frequent
co-occurrence of disorders that lead to hypoventilation and hypoxemia.
In contrast, the classification used in DSM-5 reflects evidence that
there are distinct sleep-related pathogenetic processes leading to
hypoventilation.

Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders

Diagnostic Criteria

A. A persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that is
primarily due to an alteration of the circadian system or to a
misalignment between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the sleep--wake
schedule required by an individual's physical environment or social or
professional schedule.

B. The sleep disruption leads to excessive sleepiness or insomnia, or
both.

C. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of
functioning.

**Coding note:** For ICD-9-CM, code **307.45** for all subtypes. For
ICD-10-CM, code is based on subtype.

*Specify* whether:

**307.45 (G47.21) Delayed sleep phase type:** A pattern of delayed sleep
onset and awakening times, with an inability to fall asleep and awaken
at a desired or conventionally acceptable earlier time.

*Specify* if:

**Familial:** A family history of delayed sleep phase is present.

*Specify* if:

**Overlapping with non-24-hour sleep-wake type:** Delayed sleep phase
type may overlap with another circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder,
non-24-hour sleep-wake type.

**307.45 (G47.22) Advanced sleep phase type:** A pattern of advanced
sleep onset and awakening times, with an inability to remain awake or
asleep until the desired or conventionally acceptable later sleep or
wake times.

*Specify* if:

**Familial:** A family history of advanced sleep phase is present.

**307.45 (G47.23) Irregular sleep-wake type:** A temporally disorganized
sleep-wake pattern, such that the timing of sleep and wake periods is
variable throughout the 24-hour period.

**391**

**307.45 (G47.24) Non-24-hour sleep-wake type:** A pattern of sleep-wake
cycles that is not synchronized to the 24-hour environment, with a
consistent daily drift (usually to later and later times) of sleep onset
and wake times.

**307.45 (G47.26) Shift work type:** Insomnia during the major sleep
period and/or excessive sleepiness (including inadvertent sleep) during
the major awake period associated with a shift work schedule (i.e.,
requiring unconventional work hours).

**307.45 (G47.20) Unspecified type**

*Specify* if:

**Episodic:** Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.

**Persistent:** Symptoms last 3 months or longer.

**Recurrent:** Two or more episodes occur within the space of 1 year.

Delayed Sleep Phase Type

Diagnostic Features

The delayed sleep phase type is based primarily on a history of a delay
in the timing of the major sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in
relation to the desired sleep and wake-up time, resulting in symptoms of
insomnia and excessive sleepiness. When allowed to set their own
schedule, individuals with delayed sleep phase type exhibit normal sleep
quality and duration for age. Symptoms of sleep-onset insomnia,
difficulty waking in the morning, and excessive early day sleepiness are
prominent.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Common associated features of delayed sleep phase type include a history
of mental disorders or a concurrent mental disorder. Extreme and
prolonged difficulty awakening with morning confusion is also common.
Psychophysiological insomnia may develop as a result of maladaptive
behaviors that impair sleep and increase arousal because of repeated
attempts to fall asleep at an earlier time.

Prevalence

Prevalence of delayed sleep phase type in the general population is
approximately 0.17%

but appears to be greater than 7% in adolescents. Although the
prevalence of familial delayed sleep phase type has not been
established, a family history of delayed sleep phase is present in
individuals with delayed sleep phase type.

Development and Course

Course is persistent, lasting longer than 3 months, with intermittent
exacerbations throughout adulthood. Although age at onset is variable,
symptoms begin typically in adolescence and early adulthood and persist
for several months to years before diagnosis is established. Severity
may decrease with age. Relapse of symptoms is common.

Clinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social,
school, and work obligations. Exacerbation is usually triggered by a
change in work or school schedule that requires an early rise time.
Individuals who can alter their work schedules to accommodate the
delayed circadian sleep and wake timing can experience remission of
symptoms.

Increased prevalence in adolescence may be a consequence of both
physiological and behavioral factors. Hormonal changes may be involved
specifically, as delayed sleep phase is associated with the onset of
puberty. Thus, delayed sleep phase type in adolescents should be
differentiated from the common delay in the timing of circadian rhythms
in this age group. In the familial form, the course is persistent and
may not improve significantly with age.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p437}**392**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Predisposing factors may include a longer than average circadian period,
changes in light sensitivity, and impaired homeostatic sleep drive. Some
individuals with delayed sleep phase type may be hypersensitive to
evening light, which can serve as a delay signal to the circadian clock,
or they may be hyposensitive to morning light such that its
phase-advancing effects are reduced. Genetic factors may play a role in
the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic forms of delayed sleep phase
type, including mutations in circadian genes (e.g., *PER3*, *CKIe*).

Diagnostic Markers

Confirmation of the diagnosis includes a complete history and use of a
sleep diary or actigraphy (i.e., a wrist-worn motion detector that
monitors motor activity for prolonged periods and can be used as a proxy
for sleep-wake patterns for at least 7 days). The period covered should
include weekends, when social and occupational obligations are less
strict, to ensure that the individual exhibits a consistently delayed
sleep-wake pattern. Biomarkers such as salivary dim light melatonin
onset should be obtained only when the diagnosis is unclear.

Functional Consequences of Delayed Sleep Phase Type

Excessive early day sleepiness is prominent. Extreme and prolonged
difficulty awakening with morning confusion (i.e., sleep inertia) is
also common. The severity of insomnia and excessive sleepiness symptoms
varies substantially among individuals and largely depends on the
occupational and social demands on the individual.

Differential Diagnosis

Normative variations in sleep.

Delayed sleep phase type must be distinguished from

"normal" sleep patterns in which an individual has a late schedule that
does not cause personal, social, or occupational distress (most commonly
seen in adolescents and young adults).

Other sleep disorders.

Insomnia disorder and other circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders should
be included in the differential. Excessive sleepiness may also be caused
by other sleep disturbances, such as breathing-related sleep disorders,
insomnias, sleep-related movement disorders, and medical, neurological,
and mental disorders. Overnight polysomnography may help in evaluating
for other comorbid sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea. The circadian
nature of delayed sleep phase type, however, should differentiate it
from other disorders with similar complaints.

Comorbidity

Delayed sleep phase type is strongly associated with depression,
personality disorder, and somatic symptom disorder or illness anxiety
disorder. In addition, comorbid sleep disorders, such as insomnia
disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea, as well as depressive
and bipolar disorders and anxiety disorders, can exacerbate symptoms of
insomnia and excessive sleepiness. Delayed sleep phase type may overlap
with another circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, non-24-hour
sleep-wake type. Sighted individuals with non-24-hour sleep-wake type
disorder commonly also have a history of delayed circadian sleep phase.

Advanced Sleep Phase Type

Specifiers

Advanced sleep phase type may be documented with the specified
"familial." Although the prevalence of familial advanced sleep phase
type has not been established, a family history of advanced sleep phase
is present in individuals with advanced sleep phase type.

In this type, specific mutations demonstrate an autosomal dominant mode
of inheritance.

In the familial form, onset of symptoms may occur earlier (during
childhood and early adulthood), the course is persistent, and the
severity of symptoms may increase with age.

Diagnostic Features

Advanced sleep phase type is characterized by sleep-wake times that are
several hours earlier than desired or conventional times. Diagnosis is
based primarily on a history of an advance in the timing of the major
sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to the desired
sleep and wake-up time, with symptoms of early morning insomnia and
excessive daytime sleepiness. When allowed to set their schedule,
individuals with advanced sleep phase type will exhibit normal sleep
quality and duration for age.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with advanced sleep phase type are "morning types," having
earlier sleep-wake times, with the timing of circadian biomarkers such
as melatonin and core body temperature rhythms occurring 2--4 hours
earlier than normal. When required to keep a conventional schedule
requiring a delay of bedtime, these individuals will continue to have an
early rise time, leading to persistent sleep deprivation and daytime
sleepiness. Use of hypnotics or alcohol to combat sleep-maintenance
insomnia and stimulants to reduce daytime sleepiness may lead to
substance abuse in these individuals.

Prevalence

The estimated prevalence of advanced sleep phase type is approximately
1% in middle-age adults. Sleep-wake times and circadian phase advance in
older individuals, probably accounting for increased prevalence in this
population.

Development and Course

Onset is usually in late adulthood. In the familial form, onset can be
earlier. The course is typically persistent, lasting more than 3 months,
but the severity may increase depending on work and social schedules.
The advanced sleep phase type is more common in older adults.

Clinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social,
school, and work obligations. Individuals who can alter their work
schedules to accommodate the advanced circadian sleep and wake timing
can experience remission of symptoms. Increasing age tends to advance
the sleep phase, however, it is unclear whether the common
age-associated advanced sleep phase type is due solely to a change in
circadian timing (as seen in the familial form) or also to age-related
changes in the homeostatic regulation of sleep, resulting in earlier
awakening. Severity, remission, and relapse of symptoms suggest lack of
adherence to behavioral and environmental treatments designed to control
sleep and wake structure and light exposure.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p439}**394**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Decreased late afternoon/early evening exposure to light and/or exposure
to early morning light due to early morning awakening can increase the
risk of advanced sleep phase type by advancing circadian rhythms. By
going to bed early, these individuals are not exposed to light in the
phase delay region of the curve, resulting in perpetuation of advanced
phase. In familial advanced sleep phase type, a shortening of the
endogenous circadian period can result in an advanced sleep phase,
although circadian period does not appear to systematically decrease
with age.

Genetic and physiological.

Advanced sleep phase type has demonstrated an autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance, including a *PER2* gene mutation causing
hypophos-phorylation of the PER2 protein and a missense mutation in
*CKI*.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

African Americans may have a shorter circadian period and larger
magnitude phase advances to light than do Caucasians, possibly
increasing the risk for development of advanced sleep phase type in this
population.

Diagnostic Markers

A sleep diary and actigraphy may be used as diagnostic markers, as
described earlier for delayed sleep phase type.

Functional Consequences of Advanced Sleep Phase Type

Excessive sleepiness associated with advanced sleep phase can have a
negative effect on cognitive performance, social interaction, and
safety. Use of wake-promoting agents to combat sleepiness or sedatives
for early morning awakening may increase potential for substance abuse.

Differential Diagnosis

Other sleep disorders.

Behavioral factors such as irregular sleep schedules, voluntary early
awakening, and exposure to light in the early morning should be
considered, particularly in older adults. Careful attention should be
paid to rule out other sleep-wake disorders, such as insomnia disorder,
and other mental disorders and medical conditions that can cause early
morning awakening.

Depressive and bipolar disorders.

Because early morning awakening, fatigue, and sleepiness are prominent
features of major depressive disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders
must also be considered.

Comorbidity

Medical conditions and mental disorders with the symptom of early
morning awakening, such as insomnia, can co-occur with the advance sleep
phase type.

Irregular Sleep-Wake Type

Diagnostic Features

The diagnosis of irregular sleep-wake type is based primarily on a
history of symptoms of insomnia at night (during the usual sleep period)
and excessive sleepiness (napping) during the day. Irregular sleep-wake
type is characterized by a lack of discernable sleep-wake

[]{#index_split_031.html#p440}Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders
**395**

circadian rhythm. There is no major sleep period, and sleep is
fragmented into at least three periods during the 24-hour day.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with irregular sleep-wake type typically present with
insomnia or excessive sleepiness, depending on the time of day. Sleep
and wake periods across 24 hours are fragmented, although the longest
sleep period tends to occur between 2:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M.

and is usually less than 4 hours. A history of isolation or reclusion
may occur in association with the disorder and contribute to the
symptoms via a lack of external stimuli to help entrain a normal
pattern. Individuals or their caregivers report frequent naps throughout
the day. Irregular sleep-wake type is most commonly associated with
neurodegenerative disorders, such as major neurocognitive disorder, and
many neurodevelopmental disorders in children.

Prevalence

Prevalence of irregular sleep-wake type in the general population is
unknown.

Development and Course

The course of irregular sleep-wake type is persistent. Age at onset is
variable, but the disorder is more common in older adults.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
disease, and Huntington's disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders in
children increase the risk for irregular sleep-wake type.

Environmental.

Decreased exposure to environmental light and structured daytime
activity can be associated with a low-amplitude circadian rhythm.
Hospitalized individuals are especially prone to such weak external
entraining stimuli, and even outside the hospital setting, individuals
with major neurocognitive disorder (i.e., dementia) are exposed to
significantly less bright light.

Diagnostic Markers

A detailed sleep history and a sleep diary (by a caregiver) or
actigraphy help confirm the irregular sleep-wake pattern.

Functional Consequences of

Irregular Sleep-Wake Type

Lack of a clearly discernible major sleep and wake period in irregular
sleep-wake type results in insomnia or excessive sleepiness, depending
on the time of day. Disruption of the caregiver's sleep also often
occurs and is an important consideration.

Differential Diagnosis

Normative variations in sleep.

Irregular sleep-wake type should be distinguished from a voluntary
irregular sleep-wake schedule and poor sleep hygiene, which can result
in insomnia and excessive sleepiness.

Other medical conditions and mental disorders.

Other causes of insomnia and daytime

sleepiness, including comorbid medical conditions and mental disorders
or medication, should be considered.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p441}**396**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Comorbidity

Irregular sleep-wake type is often comorbid with neurodegenerative and
neurodevelopmental disorders, such as major neurocognitive disorder,
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and
traumatic brain injury. It is also comorbid with other medical
conditions and mental disorders in which there is social isolation
and/or lack of light and structured activities.

Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type

Diagnostic Features

The diagnosis of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is based primarily on a
history of symptoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness related to
abnormal synchronization between the 24-hour light-dark cycle and the
endogenous circadian rhythm. Individuals typically present with periods
of insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or both, which alternate with short
asymptomatic periods. Starting with the asymptomatic period, when the
individual's sleep phase is aligned to the external environment, sleep
latency will gradually increase and the individual will complain of
sleep-onset insomnia. As the sleep phase continues to drift so that
sleep time is now in the daytime, the individual will have trouble
staying awake during the day and will complain of sleepiness. Because
the circadian period is not aligned to the external 24-hour environment,
symptoms will depend on when an individual tries to sleep in relation to
the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Non-24-hour sleep-wake type is most common among blind or visually
impaired individuals who have decreased light perception. In sighted
individuals, there is often a history of delayed sleep phase and of
decreased exposure to light and structured social and physical activity.
Sighted individuals with non-24-hour sleep-wake type also demonstrate
increased sleep duration.

Prevalence

Prevalence of non-24-hour sleep-wake type in the general population is
unclear, but the disorder appears rare in sighted individuals. The
prevalence in blind individuals is estimated to be 50%.

Development and Course

Course of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is persistent, with intermittent
remission and exacerbations due to changes in work and social schedules
throughout the lifespan. Age at onset is variable, depending on the
onset of visual impairment. In sighted individuals, because of the
overlap with delayed sleep phase type, non-24-hour sleep-wake type may
develop in adolescence or early adulthood. Remission and relapse of
symptoms in blind and sighted individuals largely depend on adherence to
treatments designed to control sleep and wake structure and light
exposure.

Clinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on social,
school, and work obligations. In adolescents and adults, irregular
sleep-wake schedules and exposure to light or lack of light at critical
times of the day can exacerbate the effects of sleep loss and disrupt
circadian entrainment. Consequently, symptoms of insomnia, daytime
sleepiness, and school, professional, and interpersonal functioning may
worsen.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

In sighted individuals, decreased exposure or sensitivity to light and
social and physical activity cues may contribute to a free-running
circadian rhythm. With the

[]{#index_split_031.html#p442}Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders
**397**

high frequency of mental disorders involving social isolation and cases
of non-24-hour sleep-wake type developing after a change in sleep habits
(e.g., night shift work, job loss), behavioral factors in combination
with physiological tendency may precipitate and perpetuate this disorder
in sighted individuals. Hospitalized individuals with neurological and
psychiatric disorders can become insensitive to social cues,
predisposing them to the development of non-24-hour sleep-wake type.

Genetic and physiological.

Blindness is a risk factor for non-24-hour sleep-wake type.

Non-24-hour sleep-wake type has been associated with traumatic brain
injury.

Diagnostic Markers

Diagnosis is confirmed by history and sleep diary or actigraphy for an
extended period.

Sequential measurement of phase markers (e.g., melatonin) can help
determine circadian phase in both sighted and blind individuals.

Functional Consequences of

Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type

Complaints of insomnia (sleep onset and sleep maintenance), excessive
sleepiness, or both are prominent. The unpredictability of sleep and
wake times (typically a daily delay drift) results in an inability to
attend school or maintain a steady job and may increase potential for
social isolation.

Differential Diagnosis

Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.

In sighted individuals, non-24-hour sleep-wake

type should be differentiated from delayed sleep phase type, as
individuals with delayed sleep phase type may display a similar
progressive delay in sleep period for several days.

Depressive disorders.

Depressive symptoms and depressive disorders may result in similar
circadian dysregulation and symptoms.

Comorbidity

Blindness is often comorbid with non-24-hour sleep-wake type, as are
depressive and bipolar disorders with social isolation.

Shift Work Type

Diagnostic Features

Diagnosis is primarily based on a history of the individual working
outside of the normal 8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. daytime window
(particularly at night) on a regularly scheduled (i.e., non-overtime)
basis. Symptoms of excessive sleepiness at work, and impaired sleep at
home, on a persistent basis are prominent. Presence of both sets of
symptoms are usually required for a diagnosis of shift work type.
Typically, when the individual reverts to a day-work routine, symptoms
resolve. Although the etiology is slightly different, individuals who
travel across many time zones on a very frequent basis may experience
effects similar to those experienced by individuals with shift work type
who work rotating shifts.

Prevalence

The prevalence of shift work type is unclear, but the disorder is
estimated to affect 5%--10%

of the night worker population (16%--20% of the workforce). Prevalence
rises with advancement into middle-age and beyond (Drake *et al.* 2004).

[]{#index_split_031.html#p443}**398**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Development and Course

Shift work type can appear in individuals of any age but is more
prevalent in individuals older than 50 years and typically worsens with
the passage of time if the disruptive work hours persist. Although older
adults may show similar rates of circadian phase adjustment to a change
in routine as do younger adults, they appear to experience significantly
more sleep disruption as a consequence of the circadian phase shift.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Predisposing factors include a morning-type disposition, a need for long
(i.e., more than 8 hours) sleep durations in order to feel well rested,
and strong competing social and domestic needs (e.g., parents of young
children). Individuals who are able to commit to a nocturnal lifestyle,
with few competing day-oriented demands, appear at lower risk for shift
work type.

Genetic and physiological.

Because shift workers are more likely than day workers to be obese,
obstructive sleep apnea may be present and may exacerbate the symptoms.

Diagnostic Markers

A history and sleep diary or actigraphy may be useful in diagnosis, as
discussed earlier for delayed sleep phase type.

Functional Consequences of Shift Work Type

Individuals with shift work type not only may perform poorly at work but
also appear to be at risk for accidents both at work and on the drive
home. They may also be at risk for poor mental health (e.g., alcohol use
disorder, substance use disorder, depression) and physical health (e.g.,
gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer).

Individuals with a history of bipolar disorder are particularly
vulnerable to shift work type--related episodes of mania resulting from
missed nights of sleep. Shift work type often results in interpersonal
problems.

Differential Diagnosis

Normative variations in sleep with shift work.

The diagnosis of shift work type, as opposed to the "normal"
difficulties of shift work, must depend to some extent on the severity
of symptoms and/or level of distress experienced by the individual.
Presence of shift work type symptoms even when the individual is able to
live on a day-oriented routine for several weeks at a time may suggest
the presence of other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, insomnia,
and narcolepsy, which should be ruled out.

Comorbidity

Shift work type has been associated with increased alcohol use disorder,
other substance use disorders, and depression. A variety of physical
health disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, cancer) have been found to be associated with
prolonged exposure to shift work.

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

The *International Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd Edition
(ICSD-2), differentiates nine circadian rhythm sleep disorders,
including jet lag type.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p444}Non--Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal
Disorders **399**

**Parasomnias**

*Parasomnias* are disorders characterized by abnormal behavioral,
experiential, or physiological events occurring in association with
sleep, specific sleep stages, or sleep-wake transitions. The most common
parasomnias---non--rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders and
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder---represent ad-mixtures
of wakefulness and NREM sleep and wakefulness and REM sleep,
respectively.

These conditions serve as a reminder that sleep and wakefulness are not
mutually exclusive and that sleep is not necessarily a global,
whole-brain phenomenon.

Non--Rapid Eye Movement

Sleep Arousal Disorders

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Recurrent episodes of incomplete awakening from sleep, usually
occurring during the first third of the major sleep episode, accompanied
by either one of the following: 1. **Sleepwalking:** Repeated episodes
of rising from bed during sleep and walking about. While sleepwalking,
the individual has a blank, staring face; is relatively unresponsive to
the efforts of others to communicate with him or her; and can be
awakened only with great difficulty.

2\. **Sleep terrors:** Recurrent episodes of abrupt terror arousals from
sleep, usually beginning with a panicky scream. There is intense fear
and signs of autonomic arousal, such as mydriasis, tachycardia, rapid
breathing, and sweating, during each episode. There is relative
unresponsiveness to efforts of others to comfort the individual during
the episodes.

B. No or little (e.g., only a single visual scene) dream imagery is
recalled.

C. Amnesia for the episodes is present.

D. The episodes cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).

F. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the episodes
of sleepwalking or sleep terrors.

**Coding note:** For ICD-9-CM, code **307.46** for all subtypes. For
ICD-10-CM, code is based on subtype.

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of non--rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal
disorders is the repeated occurrence of incomplete arousals, usually
beginning during the first third of the major sleep episode (Criterion
A), that typically are brief, lasting 1--10 minutes, but may be
protracted, lasting up to 1 hour. The maximum duration of an event is
unknown. The eyes are typically open during these events. Many
individuals exhibit both subtypes of arousals on different occasions,
which underscores the unitary underlying pathophysiology. The subtypes
reflect varying degrees of simultaneous occurrence of wakefulness and
NREM

sleep, resulting in complex behaviors arising from sleep with varying
degrees of conscious awareness, motor activity, and autonomic
activation.

The essential feature of *sleepwalking* is repeated episodes of complex
motor behavior initiated during sleep, including rising from bed and
walking about (Criterion A1). Sleepwalking episodes begin during any
stage of NREM sleep, most commonly during slow-wave sleep and therefore
most often occurring during the first third of the night. During
episodes, the individual has reduced alertness and responsiveness, a
blank stare, and relative unresponsiveness to communication with others
or efforts by others to awaken the individual. If awakened during the
episode (or on awakening the following morning), the individual has
limited recall for the episode. After the episode, there may initially
be a brief period of confusion or difficulty orienting, followed by full
recovery of cognitive function and appropriate behavior.

The essential feature of *sleep terrors* is the repeated occurrence of
precipitous awakenings from sleep, usually beginning with a panicky
scream or cry (Criterion A2). Sleep terrors usually begin during the
first third of the major sleep episode and last 1--10 minutes, but they
may last considerably longer, particularly in children. The episodes are
accompanied by impressive autonomic arousal and behavioral
manifestations of intense fear.

During an episode, the individual is difficult to awaken or comfort. If
the individual awakens after the sleep terror, little or none of the
dream, or only fragmentary, single images, are recalled. During a
typical episode of sleep terrors, the individual abruptly sits up in bed
screaming or crying, with a frightened expression and autonomic signs of
intense anxiety (e.g., tachycardia, rapid breathing, sweating, dilation
of the pupils). The individual may be inconsolable and is usually
unresponsive to the efforts of others to awaken or comfort him or her.
Sleep terrors are also called "night terrors" or "pavor nocturnus."

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Sleepwalking episodes can include a wide variety of behaviors. Episodes
may begin with confusion: the individual may simply sit up in bed, look
about, or pick at the blanket or sheet. This behavior then becomes
progressively complex. The individual may actually leave the bed and
walk into closets, out of the room, and even out of buildings.
Individuals may use the bathroom, eat, talk, or engage in more complex
behaviors. Running and frantic attempts to escape some apparent threat
can also occur. Most behaviors during sleepwalking episodes are routine
and of low complexity. However, cases of unlocking doors and even
operating machinery (driving an automobile) have been reported.
Sleepwalking can also include inappropriate behavior (e.g., commonly,
urinating in a closet or waste-basket). Most episodes last for several
minutes to a half hour but may be more protracted.

Inasmuch as sleep is a state of relative analgesia, painful injuries
sustained during sleepwalking may not be appreciated until awakening
after the fact.

There are two "specialized" forms of sleepwalking: sleep-related eating
behavior and sleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia or sleep sex).
Individuals with *sleep-related eating* experience unwanted recurrent
episodes of eating with varying degrees of amnesia, ranging from no
awareness to full awareness without the ability to not eat. During these
episodes, inappropriate foods may be ingested. Individuals with
sleep-related eating disorder may find evidence of their eating only the
next morning. In *sexsomnia,* varying degrees of
[]{#index_split_031.html#p446}Non--Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal
Disorders **401**

sexual activity (e.g., masturbation, fondling, groping, sexual
intercourse) occur as complex behaviors arising from sleep without
conscious awareness. This condition is more common in males and may
result in serious interpersonal relationship problems or medicolegal
consequences.

During a typical episode of sleep terrors, there is often a sense of
overwhelming dread, with a compulsion to escape. Although fragmentary
vivid dream images may occur, a storylike dream sequence (as in
nightmares) is not reported. Most commonly, the individual does not
awaken fully, but returns to sleep and has amnesia for the episode on
awakening the next morning. Usually only one episode will occur on any
one night. Occasionally several episodes may occur at intervals
throughout the night. These events rarely arise during daytime naps.

Prevalence

Isolated or infrequent NREM sleep arousal disorders are very common in
the general population. From 10% to 30% of children have had at least
one episode of sleepwalking, and 2%--3% sleepwalk often. The prevalence
of sleepwalking disorder, marked by repeated episodes and impairment or
distress, is much lower, probably in the range of 1%--5%. The prevalence
of sleepwalking episodes (not sleepwalking disorder) is 1.0%--7.0% among
adults, with weekly to monthly episodes occurring in 0.5%--0.7%. The
lifetime prevalence of sleepwalking in adults is 29.2%, with a past-year
prevalence of sleepwalking of 3.6%.

The prevalence of sleep terrors in the general population is unknown.
The prevalence of sleep terror episodes (as opposed to sleep terror
disorder, in which there is recurrence and distress or impairment) is
approximately 36.9% at 18 months of age, 19.7% at 30 months of age, and
2.2% in adults.

Development and Course

NREM sleep arousal disorders occur most commonly in childhood and
diminish in frequency with increasing age. The onset of sleepwalking in
adults with no prior history of sleepwalking as children should prompt a
search for specific etiologies, such as obstructive sleep apnea,
nocturnal seizures, or effect of medication.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Sedative use, sleep deprivation, sleep-wake schedule disruptions,
fatigue, and physical or emotional stress increase the likelihood of
episodes. Fever and sleep deprivation can produce an increased frequency
of NREM sleep arousal disorders.

Genetic and physiological.

A family history for sleepwalking or sleep terrors may occur in up to
80% of individuals who sleepwalk. The risk for sleepwalking is further
increased (to as much as 60% of offspring) when both parents have a
history of the disorder.

Individuals with sleep terrors frequently have a positive family history
of either sleep terrors or sleepwalking, with as high as a 10-fold
increase in the prevalence of the disorder among first-degree biological
relatives. Sleep terrors are much more common in monozygotic twins as
compared with dizygotic twins. The exact mode of inheritance is unknown.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Violent or sexual activity during sleepwalking episodes is more likely
to occur in adults.

Eating during sleepwalking episodes is more commonly seen in females.
Sleepwalking occurs more often in females during childhood but more
often in males during adulthood.

Older children and adults provide a more detailed recollection of
fearful images associated with sleep terrors than do younger children,
who are more likely to have complete amnesia or report only a vague
sense of fear. Among children, sleep terrors are more common in males
than in females. Among adults, the sex ratio is even.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p447}**402**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Diagnostic Markers

NREM sleep arousal disorders arise from any stage of NREM sleep but most
commonly from deep NREM sleep (slow-wave sleep). They are most likely to
appear in the first third of the night and do not commonly occur during
daytime naps. During the episode, the polysomnogram may be obscured with
movement artifact. In the absence of such artifact, the
electroencephalogram typically shows theta or alpha frequency activity
during the episode, indicating partial or incomplete arousal.

Polysomnography in conjunction with audiovisual monitoring can be used
to document episodes of sleepwalking. In the absence of actually
capturing an event during a polysomnographic recording, there are no
polysomnographic features that can serve as a marker for sleepwalking.
Sleep deprivation may increase the likelihood of capturing an event. As
a group, individuals who sleepwalk show instability of deep NREM sleep,
but the overlap in findings with individuals who do not sleepwalk is
great enough to preclude use of this indicator in establishing a
diagnosis. Unlike arousals from REM sleep associated with nightmares, in
which there is an increase in heart rate and respiration prior to the
arousal, the NREM sleep arousals of sleep terrors begin precipitously
from sleep, without anticipatory autonomic changes. The arousals are
associated with impressive autonomic activity, with doubling or tripling
of the heart rate. The pathophysiology is poorly understood, but there
appears to be instability in the deeper stages of NREM sleep. Absent
capturing an event during a formal sleep study, there are no reliable
polysomnographic indicators of the tendency to experience sleep terrors.

Functional Consequences of

Non-REM Sleep Arousal Disorders

For the diagnosis of a NREM sleep arousal disorder to be made, the
individual or household members must experience clinically significant
distress or impairment, although parasomnia symptoms may occur
occasionally in nonclinical populations and would be subthreshold for
the diagnosis. Embarrassment concerning the episodes can impair social
relationships. Social isolation or occupational difficulties can result.
The determination of a "disorder" depends on a number of factors, which
may vary on an individual basis and will depend on the frequency of
events, potential for violence or injurious behaviors, embarrassment, or
disruption/distress of other household members. Severity determination
is best made based on the nature or consequence of the behaviors rather
than simply on frequency. Uncommonly, NREM sleep arousal disorders may
result in serious injury to the individual or to someone trying to
console the individual. Injuries to others are confined to those in
close proximity; individuals are not "sought out." Typically,
sleepwalking in both children and adults is not associated with
significant mental disorders. For individuals with sleep-related eating
behaviors, unknowingly preparing or eating food during the sleep period
may create problems such as poor diabetes control, weight gain, injury
(cuts and burns), or consequences of eating dangerous or toxic
inedibles. NREM sleep arousal disorders may rarely result in violent or
injurious behaviors with forensic implications.

Differential Diagnosis

Nightmare disorder.

In contrast to individuals with NREM sleep arousal disorders,
individuals with nightmare disorder typically awaken easily and
completely, report vivid storylike dreams accompanying the episodes, and
tend to have episodes later in the night.

NREM sleep arousal disorders occur during NREM sleep, whereas nightmares
usually occur during REM sleep. Parents of children with NREM sleep
arousal disorders may misinterpret reports of fragmentary imagery as
nightmares.

Breathing-related sleep disorders.

Breathing disorders during sleep can also produce

confusional arousals with subsequent amnesia. However, breathing-related
sleep disorders are also characterized by characteristic symptoms of
snoring, breathing pauses, and

[]{#index_split_031.html#p448}Non--Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal
Disorders **403**

daytime sleepiness. In some individuals, a breathing-related sleep
disorder may precipitate episodes of sleepwalking.

REM sleep behavior disorder.

REM sleep behavior disorder may be difficult to distinguish from NREM
sleep arousal disorders. REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by
episodes of prominent, complex movements, often involving personal
injury arising from sleep. In contrast to NREM sleep arousal disorders,
REM sleep behavior disorder occurs during REM sleep. Individuals with
REM sleep behavior disorder awaken easily and report more detailed and
vivid dream content than do individuals with NREM sleep arousal
disorders. They often report that they "act out dreams."

Parasomnia overlap syndrome.

Parasomnia overlap syndrome consists of clinical and

polysomnographic features of both sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior
disorder.

Sleep-related seizures.

Some types of seizures can produce episodes of very unusual behaviors
that occur predominantly or exclusively during sleep. Nocturnal seizures
may closely mimic NREM sleep arousal disorders but tend to be more
stereotypic in nature, occur multiple times nightly, and be more likely
to occur from daytime naps. The presence of sleep-related seizures does
not preclude the presence of NREM sleep arousal disorders.

Sleep-related seizures should be classified as a form of epilepsy.

Alcohol-induced blackouts.

Alcohol-induced blackouts may be associated with extremely complex
behaviors in the absence of other suggestions of intoxication. They do
not involve the loss of consciousness but rather reflect an isolated
disruption of memory for events during a drinking episode. By history,
these behaviors may be indistinguishable from those seen in NREM sleep
arousal disorders.

Dissociative amnesia, with dissociative fugue.

Dissociative fugue may be extremely

difficult to distinguish from sleepwalking. Unlike all other
parasomnias, nocturnal dissociative fugue arises from a period of
wakefulness during sleep, rather than precipitously from sleep without
intervening wakefulness. A history of recurrent childhood physical or
sexual abuse is usually present (but may be difficult to obtain).

Malingering or other voluntary behavior occurring during wakefulness.

As with dissociative fugue, malingering or other voluntary behavior
occurring during wakefulness arises from wakefulness.

Panic disorder.

Panic attacks may also cause abrupt awakenings from deep NREM sleep
accompanied by fearfulness, but these episodes produce rapid and
complete awakening without the confusion, amnesia, or motor activity
typical of NREM sleep arousal disorders.

Medication-induced complex behaviors.

Behaviors similar to those in NREM sleep

arousal disorders can be induced by use of, or withdrawal from,
substances or medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine
sedative-hypnotics, opiates, cocaine, nicotine, antipsychotics,
tricyclic antidepressants, chloral hydrate). Such behaviors may arise
from the sleep period and may be extremely complex. The underlying
pathophysiology appears to be a relatively isolated amnesia. In such
cases, substance/medication-induced sleep disorder, parasomnia type,
should be diagnosed (see "Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder"
later in this chapter).

Night eating syndrome.

The sleep-related eating disorder form of sleepwalking is to be
differentiated from night eating syndrome, in which there is a delay in
the circadian rhythm of food ingestion and an association with insomnia
and/or depression.

Comorbidity

In adults, there is an association between sleepwalking and major
depressive episodes and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Children or
adults with sleep terrors may have elevated scores for depression and
anxiety on personality inventories.

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

The *International Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd Edition,
includes "confusional arousal" as a NREM sleep arousal disorder.

Nightmare Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**307.47 (F51.5)**

A. Repeated occurrences of extended, extremely dysphoric, and
well-remembered dreams that usually involve efforts to avoid threats to
survival, security, or physical integrity and that generally occur
during the second half of the major sleep episode.

B. On awakening from the dysphoric dreams, the individual rapidly
becomes oriented and alert.

C. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

D. The nightmare symptoms are not attributable to the physiological
effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).

E. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not adequately explain the
predominant complaint of dysphoric dreams.

*Specify* if:

**During sleep onset**

*Specify* if:

**With associated non--sleep disorder,** including substance use
disorders **With associated other medical condition**

**With associated other sleep disorder**

**Coding note:** The code 307.47 (F51.5) applies to all three
specifiers. Code also the relevant associated mental disorder, medical
condition, or other sleep disorder immediately after the code for
nightmare disorder in order to indicate the association.

*Specify* if:

**Acute:** Duration of period of nightmares is 1 month or less.

**Subacute:** Duration of period of nightmares is greater than 1 month
but less than 6 months.

**Persistent:** Duration of period of nightmares is 6 months or greater.

*Specify* current severity:

Severity can be rated by the frequency with which the nightmares occur:
**Mild:** Less than one episode per week on average.

**Moderate:** One or more episodes per week but less than nightly.

**Severe:** Episodes nightly.

Diagnostic Features

*Nightmares* are typically lengthy, elaborate, storylike sequences of
dream imagery that seem real and that incite anxiety, fear, or other
dysphoric emotions. Nightmare content typically focuses on attempts to
avoid or cope with imminent danger but may involve themes that evoke
other negative emotions. Nightmares occurring after traumatic
experiences may replicate the threatening situation ("replicative
nightmares"), but most do not.

On awakening, nightmares are well remembered and can be described in
detail. They arise

[]{#index_split_031.html#p450}Nightmare Disorder

**405**

almost exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and can thus
occur throughout sleep but are more likely in the second half of the
major sleep episode when dreaming is longer and more intense. Factors
that increase early-night REM intensity, such as sleep fragmentation or
deprivation, jet lag, and REM-sensitive medications, might facilitate
nightmares earlier in the night, including at sleep onset.

Nightmares usually terminate with awakening and rapid return of full
alertness. However, the dysphoric emotions may persist into wakefulness
and contribute to difficulty returning to sleep and lasting daytime
distress. Some nightmares, known as "bad dreams,"

may not induce awakening and are recalled only later. If nightmares
occur during sleep-onset REM periods ( *hypnagogic*), the dysphoric
emotion is frequently accompanied by a sense of being both awake and
unable to move voluntarily ( *isolated sleep paralysis*).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Mild autonomic arousal, including sweating, tachycardia, and tachypnea,
may characterize nightmares. Body movements and vocalizations are not
characteristic because of REM

sleep--related loss of skeletal muscle tone, but such behaviors may
occur under situations of emotional stress or sleep fragmentation and in
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

When talking or emoting occurs, it is typically a brief event
terminating the nightmare.

Individuals with frequent nightmares are at substantially greater risk
for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, even when gender and mental
illness are taken into account.

Prevalence

Prevalence of nightmares increases through childhood into adolescence.
From 1.3% to 3.9% of parents report that their preschool children have
nightmares "often" or "always".

Prevalence increases from ages 10 to 13 for both males and females but
continues to increase to ages 20--29 for females (while decreasing for
males), when it can be twice as high for females as for males.
Prevalence decreases steadily with age for both sexes, but the gender
difference remains. Among adults, prevalence of nightmares at least
monthly is 6%, whereas prevalence for frequent nightmares is 1%--2%.
Estimates often combine idiopathic and posttraumatic nightmares
indiscriminately.

Development and Course

Nightmares often begin between ages 3 and 6 years but reach a peak
prevalence and severity in late adolescence or early adulthood.
Nightmares most likely appear in children exposed to acute or chronic
psychosocial stressors and thus may not resolve spontaneously. In a
minority, frequent nightmares persist into adulthood, becoming virtually
a lifelong disturbance. Although specific nightmare content may reflect
the individual's age, the essential features of the disorder are the
same across age groups.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Individuals who experience nightmares report more frequent past adverse
events, but not necessarily trauma, and often display personality
disturbances or psychiatric diagnosis.

Environmental.

Sleep deprivation or fragmentation, and irregular sleep-wake schedules
that alter the timing, intensity, or quantity of REM sleep, can put
individuals at risk for nightmares.

Genetic and physiological.

Twin studies have identified genetic effects on the disposition to
nightmares and their co-occurrence with other parasomnias (e.g.,
sleeptalking).

Course modifiers.

Adaptive parental bedside behaviors, such as soothing the child
following nightmares, may protect against developing chronic nightmares.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p451}**406**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The significance attributed to nightmares may vary by culture, and
sensitivity to such beliefs may facilitate disclosure.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Adult females report having nightmares more frequently than do adult
males. Nightmare content differs by sex, with adult females tending to
report themes of sexual harassment or of loved ones disappearing/dying,
and adult males tending to report themes of physical aggression or
war/terror.

Diagnostic Markers

Polysomnographic studies demonstrate abrupt awakenings from REM sleep,
usually during the second half of the night, prior to report of a
nightmare. Heart, respiratory, and eye movement rates may quicken or
increase in variability before awakening. Nightmares following traumatic
events may also arise during non-REM (NREM), particularly stage 2,
sleep. The typical sleep of individuals with nightmares is mildly
impaired (e.g., reduced efficiency, less slow-wave sleep, more
awakenings), with more frequent periodic leg movements in sleep and
relative sympathetic nervous system activation after REM sleep
deprivation.

Functional Consequences of Nightmare Disorder

Nightmares cause more significant subjective distress than demonstrable
social or occupational impairment. However, if awakenings are frequent
or result in sleep avoidance, individuals may experience excessive
daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, depression, anxiety, or
irritability. Frequent childhood nightmares (e.g., several per week),
may cause significant distress to parents and child.

Differential Diagnosis

Sleep terror disorder.

Both nightmare disorder and sleep terror disorder include awakenings or
partial awakenings with fearfulness and autonomic activation, but the
two disorders are differentiable. Nightmares typically occur later in
the night, during REM sleep, and produce vivid, storylike, and clearly
recalled dreams; mild autonomic arousal; and complete awakenings. Sleep
terrors typically arise in the first third of the night during stage 3
or 4 NREM sleep and produce either no dream recall or images without an
elaborate storylike quality. The terrors lead to partial awakenings that
leave the individual confused, disoriented, and only partially
responsive and with substantial autonomic arousal.

There is usually amnesia for the event in the morning.

REM sleep behavior disorder.

The presence of complex motor activity during frightening dreams should
prompt further evaluation for REM sleep behavior disorder, which occurs
more typically among late middle-age males and, unlike nightmare
disorder, is associated with often violent dream enactments and a
history of nocturnal injuries. The dream disturbance of REM sleep
behavior disorder is described by patients as nightmares but is
controlled by appropriate medication.

Bereavement.

Dysphoric dreams may occur during bereavement but typically involve loss
and sadness and are followed by self-reflection and insight, rather than
distress, on awakening.

Narcolepsy.

Nightmares are a frequent complaint in narcolepsy, but the presence of
excessive sleepiness and cataplexy differentiates this condition from
nightmare disorder.

Nocturnal seizures.

Seizures may rarely manifest as nightmares and should be evaluated with
polysomnography and continuous video electroencephalography. Nocturnal
seizures usually involve stereotypical motor activity. Associated
nightmares, if recalled,

[]{#index_split_031.html#p452}Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder
**407**

are often repetitive in nature or reflect epileptogenic features such as
the content of diurnal auras (e.g., unmotivated dread), phosphenes, or
ictal imagery. Disorders of arousal, especially confusional arousals,
may also be present.

Breathing-related sleep disorders.

Breathing-related sleep disorders can lead to awakenings with autonomic
arousal, but these are not usually accompanied by recall of nightmares.

Panic disorder.

Attacks arising during sleep can produce abrupt awakenings with
autonomic arousal and fearfulness, but nightmares are typically not
reported and symptoms are similar to panic attacks arising during
wakefulness.

Sleep-related dissociative disorders.

Individuals may recall actual physical or emotional trauma as a "dream"
during electroencephalography-documented awakenings.

Medication or substance use.

Numerous substances/medications can precipitate nightmares, including
dopaminergics; beta-adrenergic antagonists and other antihypertensives;
amphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulants; antidepressants; smoking
cessation aids; and melatonin. Withdrawal of REM sleep--suppressant
medications (e.g., antidepressants) and alcohol can produce REM sleep
rebound accompanied by nightmares. If nightmares are sufficiently severe
to warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of substance/

medication-induced sleep disorder should be considered.

Comorbidity

Nightmares may be comorbid with several medical conditions, including
coronary heart disease, cancer, parkinsonism, and pain, and can
accompany medical treatments, such as he-modialysis, or withdrawal from
medications or substances of abuse. Nightmares frequently are comorbid
with other mental disorders, including PTSD; insomnia disorder;
schizophrenia; psychosis; mood, anxiety, adjustment, and personality
disorders; and grief during bereavement. A concurrent nightmare disorder
diagnosis should only be considered when independent clinical attention
is warranted (i.e., Criteria A--C are met). Otherwise, no separate
diagnosis is necessary. These conditions should be listed under the
appropriate comorbid category specifier. However, nightmare disorder may
be diagnosed as a separate disorder in individuals with PTSD if the
nightmares are temporally unrelated to PTSD (i.e., preceding other PTSD
symptoms or persisting after other PTSD symptoms have resolved).

Nightmares are normally characteristic of REM sleep behavior disorder,
PTSD, and acute stress disorder, but nightmare disorder may be
independently coded if nightmares preceded the condition and their
frequency or severity necessitates independent clinical attention. The
latter may be determined by asking whether nightmares were a problem
before onset of the other disorder and whether they continued after
other symptoms had remitted.

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

The *International Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd Edition
(ICSD-2), presents similar diagnostic criteria for nightmare disorder.

Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**327.42 (G47.52)**

A. Repeated episodes of arousal during sleep associated with
vocalization and/or complex motor behaviors.

B. These behaviors arise during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and
therefore usually occur more than 90 minutes after sleep onset, are more
frequent during the later portions of the sleep period, and uncommonly
occur during daytime naps.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p453}**408**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

C. Upon awakening from these episodes, the individual is completely
awake, alert, and not confused or disoriented.

D. Either of the following:

1\. REM sleep without atonia on polysomnographic recording.

2\. A history suggestive of REM sleep behavior disorder and an
established synucleinopathy diagnosis (e.g., Parkinson's disease,
multiple system atrophy).

E. The behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (which may
include injury to self or the bed partner).

F. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition.

G. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the episodes.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior
disorder is repeated episodes of arousal, often associated with
vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors arising from REM sleep
(Criterion A). These behaviors often reflect motor responses to the
content of action-filled or violent dreams of being attacked or trying
to escape from a threatening situation, which may be termed *dream
enacting behaviors.* The vocalizations are often loud, emotion-filled,
and profane. These behaviors may be very bothersome to the individual
and the bed partner and may result in significant injury (e.g., falling,
jumping, or flying out of bed; running, punching, thrusting, hitting, or
kicking). Upon awakening, the individual is immediately awake, alert,
and oriented (Criterion C) and is often able to recall dream mentation,
which closely correlates with the observed behavior. The eyes typically
remain closed during these events. The diagnosis of REM sleep behavior
disorder requires clinically significant distress or impairment
(Criterion E); this determination will depend on a number of factors,
including the frequency of events, the potential for violence or
injurious behaviors, embarrassment, and distress in other household
members.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Severity determination is best made based on the nature or consequence
of the behavior rather than simply on frequency. Although the behaviors
are typically prominent and violent, lesser behaviors may also occur.

Prevalence

The prevalence of REM sleep behavior disorder is approximately
0.38%--0.5% in the general population. Prevalence in patients with
psychiatric disorders may be greater, possibly related to medications
prescribed for the psychiatric disorder.

Development and Course

The onset of REM sleep behavior disorder may be gradual or rapid, and
the course is usually progressive. REM sleep behavior disorder
associated with neurodegenerative disorders may improve as the
underlying neurodegenerative disorder progresses. Because of the very
high association with the later appearance of an underlying
neurodegenerative disorder, most notably one of the synucleinopathies
(Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or major or mild
neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies), the neurological status of
individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder should be closely
monitored.

REM sleep behavior disorder overwhelmingly affects males older than 50
years, but increasingly this disorder is being identified in females and
in younger individuals. Symp-

[]{#index_split_031.html#p454}Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder
**409**

toms in young individuals, particularly young females, should raise the
possibility of narcolepsy or medication-induced REM sleep behavior
disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Many widely prescribed medications, including tricyclic antidepressants,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors, and beta-blockers, may result in polysomnographic
evidence of REM sleep without atonia and in frank REM sleep behavior
disorder. It is not known whether the medications per se result in REM
sleep behavior disorder or they unmask an underlying predisposition.

Diagnostic Markers

Associated laboratory findings from polysomnography indicate increased
tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity during REM sleep that is
normally associated with muscle atonia. The increased muscle activity
variably affects different muscle groups, mandating more extensive
electromyographic monitoring than is employed in conventional sleep
studies. For this reason, it is suggested that electromyographic
monitoring include the submen-talis, bilateral extensor digitorum, and
bilateral anterior tibialis muscle groups. Continuous video monitoring
is mandatory. Other polysomnographic findings may include very frequent
periodic and aperiodic extremity electromyography activity during
non-REM

(NREM) sleep. This polysomnography observation, termed *REM sleep
without atonia,* is present in virtually all cases of REM sleep behavior
disorder but may also be an asymptomatic polysomnographic finding.
Clinical dream-enacting behaviors coupled with the polysomnographic
finding of REM without atonia is necessary for the diagnosis of REM
sleep behavior disorder. REM sleep without atonia without a clinical
history of dream-enacting behaviors is simply an asymptomatic
polysomnographic observation. It is not known whether isolated REM sleep
without atonia is a precursor to REM sleep behavior disorder.

Functional Consequences of

Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder

REM sleep behavior disorder may occur in isolated occasions in otherwise
unaffected individuals. Embarrassment concerning the episodes can impair
social relationships. Individuals may avoid situations in which others
might become aware of the disturbance, visiting friends overnight, or
sleeping with bed partners. Social isolation or occupational
difficulties can result. Uncommonly, REM sleep behavior disorder may
result in serious injury to the victim or to the bed partner.

Differential Diagnosis

Other parasomnias.

Confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors can easily be
confused with REM sleep behavior disorder. In general, these disorders
occur in younger individuals. Unlike REM sleep behavior disorder, they
arise from deep NREM sleep and therefore tend to occur in the early
portion of the sleep period. Awakening from a confusional arousal is
associated with confusion, disorientation, and incomplete recall of
dream mentation accompanying the behavior. Polysomnographic monitoring
in the disorders of arousal reveals normal REM atonia.

Nocturnal seizures.

Nocturnal seizures may perfectly mimic REM sleep behavior disorder, but
the behaviors are generally more stereotyped. Polysomnographic
monitoring employing a full electroencephalographic seizure montage may
differentiate the two. REM

sleep without atonia is not present on polysomnographic monitoring.

[]{#index_split_031.html#p455}**410**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

Obstructive sleep apnea.

Obstructive sleep apnea may result in behaviors indistinguishable from
REM sleep behavior disorder. Polysomnographic monitoring is necessary to
differentiate between the two. In this case, the symptoms resolve
following effective treatment of the obstructive sleep apnea, and REM
sleep without atonia is not present on polysomnography monitoring.

Other specified dissociative disorder (sleep-related psychogenic
dissociative disorder).

Unlike virtually all other parasomnias, which arise precipitously from
NREM or REM

sleep, psychogenic dissociative behaviors arise from a period of
well-defined wakefulness during the sleep period. Unlike REM sleep
behavior disorder, this condition is more prevalent in young females.

Malingering.

Many cases of malingering in which the individual reports problematic
sleep movements perfectly mimic the clinical features of REM sleep
behavior disorder, and polysomnographic documentation is mandatory.

Comorbidity

REM sleep behavior disorder is present concurrently in approximately 30%
of patients with narcolepsy. When it occurs in narcolepsy, the
demographics reflect the younger age range of narcolepsy, with equal
frequency in males and females. Based on findings from individuals
presenting to sleep clinics, most individuals (\>50%) with initially
"idiopathic"

REM sleep behavior disorder will eventually develop a neurodegenerative
disease---most notably, one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's
disease, multiple system atrophy, or major or mild neurocognitive
disorder with Lewy bodies). REM sleep behavior disorder often predates
any other sign of these disorders by many years (often more than a
decade).

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

REM sleep behavior disorder is virtually identical to REM sleep behavior
disorder in the *International Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd
Edition (ICSD-2).

Restless Legs Syndrome

Diagnostic Criteria

**333.94 (G25.81)**

A. An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by or in response to
uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs, characterized by
all of the following: 1. The urge to move the legs begins or worsens
during periods of rest or inactivity.

2\. The urge to move the legs is partially or totally relieved by
movement.

3\. The urge to move the legs is worse in the evening or at night than
during the day, or occurs only in the evening or at night.

B. The symptoms in Criterion A occur at least three times per week and
have persisted for at least 3 months.

C. The symptoms in Criterion A are accompanied by significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic,
behavioral, or other important areas of functioning.

D. The symptoms in Criterion A are not attributable to another mental
disorder or medical condition (e.g., arthritis, leg edema, peripheral
ischemia, leg cramps) and are not better explained by a behavioral
condition (e.g., positional discomfort, habitual foot tapping).

E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a
drug of abuse or medication (e.g., akathisia).

[]{#index_split_031.html#p456}Restless Legs Syndrome

**411**

Diagnostic Features

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor, neurological sleep
disorder characterized by a desire to move the legs or arms, usually
associated with uncomfortable sensations typically described as
creeping, crawling, tingling, burning, or itching (Criterion A). The
diagnosis of RLS is based primarily on patient self-report and history.
Symptoms are worse when the individual is at rest, and frequent
movements of the legs occur in an effort to relieve the uncomfortable
sensations. Symptoms are worse in the evening or night, and in some
individuals they occur only in the evening or night. Evening worsening
occurs independently of any differences in activity. It is important to
differentiate RLS from other conditions such as positional discomfort
and leg cramps (Criterion D).

The symptoms of RLS can delay sleep onset and awaken the individual from
sleep and are associated with significant sleep fragmentation. The
relief obtained from moving the legs may no longer be apparent in severe
cases. RLS is associated with daytime sleepiness and is frequently
accompanied by significant clinical distress or functional impairment.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) can serve as corroborating
evidence for RLS, with up to 90% of individuals diagnosed with RLS
demonstrating PLMS when recordings are taken over multiple nights.
Periodic leg movements during wakefulness are supportive of an RLS
diagnosis. Reports of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep and of
excessive daytime sleepiness may also support the diagnosis of RLS.
Additional supportive features include a family history of RLS among
first-degree relatives and a reduction in symptoms, at least initially,
with dopaminergic treatment.

Prevalence

Prevalence rates of RLS vary widely when broad criteria are utilized but
range from 2% to 7.2% when more defined criteria are employed. When
frequency of symptoms is at least three times per week with moderate or
severe distress, the prevalence rate is 1.6%; when frequency of symptoms
is a minimum of one time per week, the prevalence rate is 4.5%.

Females are 1.5--2 times more likely than males to have RLS. RLS also
increases with age.

The prevalence of RLS may be lower in Asian populations.

Development and Course

The onset of RLS typically occurs in the second or third decade.
Approximately 40% of individuals diagnosed with RLS during adulthood
report having experienced symptoms before age 20 years, and 20% report
having experienced symptoms before age 10 years.

Prevalence rates of RLS increase steadily with age until about age 60
years, with symptoms remaining stable or decreasing slightly in older
age groups. Compared with nonfamilial cases, familial RLS usually has a
younger age at onset and a slower progressive course. The clinical
course of RLS differs by age at onset. When onset occurs before age 45,
there is often a slow progression of symptoms. In late-onset RLS, rapid
progression is typical, and aggravating factors are common. Symptoms of
RLS appear similar across the lifespan, remaining stable or decreasing
slightly in older age groups.

Diagnosis of RLS in children can be difficult because of the self-report
component.

While Criterion A for adults assumes that the description of "urge to
move" is by the patient, pediatric diagnosis requires a description in
the child's own words rather than by a parent or caretaker. Typically
children age 6 years or older are able to provide detailed, adequate
descriptors of RLS. However, children rarely use or understand the word
"urge,"

reporting instead that their legs "have to" or "got to" move. Also,
potentially related to prolonged periods of sitting during class,
two-thirds of children and adolescents report daytime leg sensations.
Thus, for diagnostic Criterion A3, it is important to compare equal

[]{#index_split_031.html#p457}**412**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

duration of sitting or lying down in the day to sitting or lying down in
the evening or night.

Nocturnal worsening tends to persist even in the context of pediatric
RLS. As with RLS in adults, there is a significant negative impact on
sleep, mood, cognition, and function. Impairment in children and
adolescents is manifested more often in behavioral and educational
domains.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Predisposing factors include female gender, advancing age, genetic risk
variants, and family history of RLS. Precipitating factors are often
time-limited, such as iron deficiency, with most individuals resuming
normal sleep patterns after the initial triggering event has
disappeared. Genetic risk variants also play a role in RLS secondary to
such disorders as uremia, suggesting that individuals with a genetic
susceptibility develop RLS in the presence of further risk factors. RLS
has a strong familial component.

There are defined pathophysiological pathways subserving RLS.
Genome-wide association studies have found that RLS is significantly
associated with common genetic variants in intronic or intergenic
regions in *MEIS1*, *BTBD9*, and *MAP2K5* on chromosomes 2p, 6p, and
15q, respectively. The association of these three variants with RLS has
been independently replicated. *BTBD9* confers a very large (80%)
excessive risk when even a single allele is present. Because of the high
frequency of this variant in individuals of European descent, the
population attributable risk (PAR) approximates 50%. At-risk alleles
associated with *MEIS1* and *BTBD9* are less common in individuals of
African or Asian descent, perhaps suggesting lower risk for RLS in these
populations.

Pathophysiological mechanisms in RLS also include disturbances in the
central dopaminergic system and disturbances in iron metabolism. The
endogenous opiate system may also be involved. Treatment effects of
dopaminergic drugs (primarily D2 and D3 non-ergot agonists) provide
further support that RLS is grounded in dysfunctional central
dopaminergic pathways. While the effective treatment of RLS has also
been shown to significantly reduce depressive symptoms, serotonergic
antidepressants can induce or aggravate RLS in some individuals.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Although RLS is more prevalent in females than in males, there are no
diagnostic differences according to gender. However, the prevalence of
RLS during pregnancy is two to three times greater than in the general
population. RLS associated with pregnancy peaks during the third
trimester and improves or resolves in most cases soon after delivery.
The gender difference in prevalence of RLS is explained at least in part
by parity, with nullipa-rous females being at the same risk of RLS as
age-matched males.

Diagnostic Markers

Polysomnography demonstrates significant abnormalities in RLS, commonly
increased latency to sleep, and higher arousal index. Polysomnography
with a preceding immobili-zation test may provide an indicator of the
motor sign of RLS, periodic limb movements, under standard conditions of
sleep and during quiet resting, both of which can provoke RLS

symptoms.

Functional Consequences of Restless Legs Syndrome

Forms of RLS severe enough to significantly impair functioning or
associated with mental disorders, including depression and anxiety,
occur in approximately 2%--3% of the population.

Although the impact of milder symptoms is less well characterized,
individuals with RLS complain of disruption in at least one activity of
daily living, with up to 50% reporting

[]{#index_split_031.html#p458}Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep
Disorder **413**

a negative impact on mood, and 47.6% reporting a lack of energy. The
most common consequences of RLS are sleep disturbance, including reduced
sleep time, sleep fragmentation, and overall disturbance; depression,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress
disorder; and quality-of-life impairments. RLS can result in daytime
sleepiness or fatigue and is frequently accompanied by significant
distress or impairment in affective, social, occupational, educational,
academic, behavioral, or cognitive functioning.

Differential Diagnosis

The most important conditions in the differential diagnosis of RLS are
leg cramps, positional discomfort, arthralgias/arthritis, myalgias,
positional ischemia (numbness), leg edema, peripheral neuropathy,
radiculopathy, and habitual foot tapping. "Knotting" of the muscle
(cramps), relief with a single postural shift, limitation to joints,
soreness to palpation (myalgias), and other abnormalities on physical
examination are not characteristic of RLS. Unlike RLS, nocturnal leg
cramps do not typically present with the desire to move the limbs nor
are there frequent limb movements. Less common conditions to be
differentiated from RLS include neuroleptic-induced akathisia,
myelopathy, symptomatic venous insufficiency, peripheral artery disease,
eczema, other orthopedic problems, and anxiety-induced restlessness.
Worsening at night and periodic limb movements are more common in RLS
than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy.

While is it important that RLS symptoms not be solely accounted for by
another medical or behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated
that any of these similar conditions can occur in an individual with
RLS. This necessitates a separate focus on each possible condition in
the diagnostic process and when assessing impact. For cases in which the
diagnosis of RLS is not certain, evaluation for the supportive features
of RLS, particularly PLMS or a family history of RLS, may be helpful.
Clinical features, such as response to a dopaminergic agent and positive
family history for RLS, can help with the differential diagnosis.

Comorbidity

Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and attentional disorders are
commonly comorbid with RLS and are discussed in the section "Functional
Consequences of Restless Legs Syndrome." The main medical disorder
comorbid with RLS is cardiovascular disease.

There may be an association with numerous other medical disorders,
including hypertension, narcolepsy, migraine, Parkinson's disease,
multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, obstructive sleep apnea,
diabetes mellitus, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, obesity, thyroid disease,
and cancer. Iron deficiency, pregnancy, and chronic renal failure are
also comorbid with RLS.

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

The *International Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd Edition
(ICSD-2), presents similar diagnostic criteria for RLS but does not
contain a criterion specifying frequency or duration of symptoms.

Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):

intoxication or after withdrawal from or exposure to a medication.

2\. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the
symptoms in Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sleep disorder that is
not substance/

medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sleep disorder could
include the following:

The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month)
after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there
is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent
nonsubstance/medication-induced sleep disorder (e.g., a history of
recurrent nonsubstance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of
substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in
Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are
sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-induced sleep disorders are indicated in the
table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM

code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use
disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance
use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the
4th position character is "1," and the clinician should record "mild
\[substance\] use disorder" before the substance-induced sleep disorder
(e.g.,

"mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder"). If a
moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is "2," and
the clinician should record "moderate \[substance\] use disorder"

or "severe \[substance\] use disorder," depending on the severity of the
comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use
disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the
4th position character is "9," and the clinician should record only the
substance-induced sleep disorder. A moderate or severe tobacco use
disorder is required in order to code a tobacco-induced sleep disorder;
it is not permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder or no
tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced sleep disorder.

*Specify* whether:

**Insomnia type:** Characterized by difficulty falling asleep or
maintaining sleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, or nonrestorative
sleep.

**Daytime sleepiness type:** Characterized by predominant complaint of
excessive sleepiness/fatigue during waking hours or, less commonly, a
long sleep period.

**Parasomnia type:** Characterized by abnormal behavioral events during
sleep.

**Mixed type:** Characterized by a substance/medication-induced sleep
problem characterized by multiple types of sleep symptoms, but no
symptom clearly predominates.

*Specify* if (see Table 1 in the chapter "Substance-Related and
Addictive Disorders" for diagnoses associated with substance class):

**With onset during intoxication:** This specifier should be used if
criteria are met for intoxication with the substance/medication and
symptoms developed during the intoxication period.

**With onset during discontinuation/withdrawal:** This specifier should
be used if criteria are met for discontinuation/withdrawal from the
substance/medication and symptoms developed during, or shortly after,
discontinuation of the substance/medication.

Recording Procedures

ICD-9-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced sleep disorder begins with
the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, bupropion) that is presumed to be
causing the sleep disturbance. The diagnostic code is selected from the
table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class.
For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
bupropion), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases
in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used.

The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during
discontinuation/withdrawal), followed by the subtype designation (i.e.,
insomnia type, daytime sleepiness type, parasomnia type, mixed type).
Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the
substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single
code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance
use disorder. For example, in the case of insomnia occurring during
withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis
is 292.85

lorazepam-induced sleep disorder, with onset during withdrawal, insomnia
type. An additional diagnosis of 304.10 severe lorazepam use disorder is
also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant
role in the development of the sleep disturbance, each should be listed
separately (e.g., 292.85 alcohol-induced sleep disorder, with onset
during intoxication, insomnia type; 292.85 cocaine-induced sleep
disorder, with onset during intoxication, insomnia type).

ICD-10-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced sleep disorder begins with
the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, bupropion) that is presumed to be
causing the sleep disturbance. The diagnostic code is selected from the
table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and
presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances
that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., bupropion), the code for
"other substance"

should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an
etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the
category "unknown substance" should be used.

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the substance-induced sleep disorder, followed by the
specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset

[]{#index_split_033.html#p461}**416**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

during discontinuation/withdrawal), followed by the subtype designation
(i.e., insomnia type, daytime sleepiness type, parasomnia type, mixed
type). For example, in the case of insomnia occurring during withdrawal
in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13.282
severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced sleep disorder,
with onset during withdrawal, insomnia type. A separate diagnosis of the
comorbid severe lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the
substance-induced sleep disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use
disorder (e.g., with medication use), no accompanying substance use
disorder is noted (e.g., F19.982 bupropion-induced sleep disorder, with
onset during medication use, insomnia type). When more than one
substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the
sleep disturbance, each should be listed separately (e.g., F10.282
severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sleep disorder, with
onset during intoxication, insomnia type; F14.282 severe cocaine use
disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during
intoxication, insomnia type).

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is
a prominent sleep disturbance that is sufficiently severe to warrant
independent clinical attention (Criterion A) and that is judged to be
primarily associated with the pharmacological effects of a substance
(i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, toxin exposure) (Criterion B).
Depending on the substance involved, one of four types of sleep
disturbances is reported. Insomnia type and daytime sleepiness type are
most common, while parasomnia type is seen less often. The mixed type is
noted when more than one type of sleep disturbance--related symptom is
present and none predominates. The disturbance must not be better
explained by another sleep disorder (Criterion C). A
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is distinguished from
insomnia disorder or a disorder associated with excessive daytime
sleepiness by considering onset and course. For drugs of abuse, there
must be evidence of intoxication or withdrawal from the history,
physical examination, or laboratory findings.
Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder arises only in association
with intoxication or discontinuation/withdrawal states, whereas other
sleep disorders may precede the onset of substance use or occur during
times of sustained abstinence. As discontinuation/withdrawal states for
some substances can be protracted, onset of the sleep disturbance can
occur 4 weeks after cessation of substance use, and the disturbance may
have features atypical of other sleep disorders (e.g., atypical age at
onset or course). The diagnosis is not made if the sleep disturbance
occurs only during a delirium (Criterion D). The symptoms must cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E). This diagnosis
should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or
substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate
in the clinical picture and when the symptoms warrant independent
clinical attention.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

During periods of substance/medication use, intoxication, or withdrawal,
individuals frequently complain of dysphoric mood, including depression
and anxiety, irritability, cognitive impairment, inability to
concentrate, and fatigue.

Prominent and severe sleep disturbances can occur in association with
intoxication with the following classes of substances: alcohol;
caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics;
stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown) substances.
Prominent and severe sleep disturbances can occur in association with
withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; caffeine;
cannabis; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulant
(including cocaine); tobacco; and other (or unknown) substances. Some
medications that invoke sleep disturbances include adrenergic agonists
and antagonists, dopamine agonists and antagonists, cholinergic agonists
and antagonists, serotonergic agonists and antagonists, antihistamines,
and corticosteroids.

[]{#index_split_033.html#p462}Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep
Disorder **417**

Alcohol.

Alcohol-induced sleep disorder typically occurs as insomnia type. During
acute intoxication, alcohol produces an immediate sedative effect
depending on dose, accompanied by increased stages 3 and 4 non--rapid
eye movement (NREM) sleep and reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
Following these initial effects, there may be increased wakefulness,
restless sleep, and vivid and anxiety-laden dreams for the remaining
sleep period. In parallel, stages 3 and 4 sleep are reduced, and
wakefulness and REM

sleep are increased. Alcohol can aggravate breathing-related sleep
disorder. With habitual use, alcohol continues to show a short-lived
sedative effect in the first half of the night, followed by sleep
continuity disruption in the second half. During alcohol withdrawal,
there is extremely disrupted sleep continuity, and an increased amount
and intensity of REM

sleep, associated frequently with vivid dreaming, which in extreme form,
constitutes part of alcohol withdrawal delirium. After acute withdrawal,
chronic alcohol users may continue to complain of light, fragmented
sleep for weeks to years associated with a persistent deficit in
slow-wave sleep.

Caffeine.

Caffeine-induced sleep disorder produces insomnia in a dose-dependent
manner, with some individuals presenting with daytime sleepiness related
to withdrawal.

Cannabis.

Acute administration of cannabis may shorten sleep latency, though
arousing effects with increments in sleep latency also occur. Cannabis
enhances slow-wave sleep and suppresses REM sleep after acute
administration. In chronic users, tolerance to the sleep-inducing and
slow-wave sleep--enhancing effects develops. Upon withdrawal, sleep
difficulties and unpleasant dreams have been reported lasting for
several weeks.

Polysomnography studies demonstrate reduced slow-wave sleep and
increased REM sleep during this phase.

Opioids.

Opioids may produce an increase in sleepiness and in subjective depth of
sleep, and reduced REM sleep, during acute short-term use. With
continued administration, tolerance to the sedative effects of opioids
develops and there are complaints of insomnia.

Consistent with their respiratory depressant effects, opioids exacerbate
sleep apnea.

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances.

Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics (e.g.,

barbiturates, benzodiazepines receptor agonists, meprobamate,
glutethimide, methypry-lon) have similar effects as opioids on sleep.
During acute intoxication, sedative-hypnotic drugs produce the expected
increase in sleepiness and decrease in wakefulness. Chronic use
(particularly of barbiturates and the older nonbarbiturate,
nonbenzodiazepine drugs) may cause tolerance with subsequent return of
insomnia. Daytime sleepiness may occur.

Sedative-hypnotic drugs can increase the frequency and severity of
obstructive sleep apnea events. Parasomnias are associated with use of
benzodiazepine receptor agonists, especially when these medications are
taken at higher doses and when they are combined with other sedative
drugs. Abrupt discontinuation of chronic sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use can lead to withdrawal but more commonly rebound
insomnia, a condition of an exacerbation of insomnia upon drug
discontinuation for 1--2 days reported to occur even with short-term
use. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs with short durations of
action are most likely to produce complaints of rebound insomnia,
whereas those with longer durations of action are more often associated
with daytime sleepiness. Any sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drug can
potentially cause daytime sedation, withdrawal, or rebound insomnia.

Amphetamines and related substances and other stimulants.

Sleep disorders induced

by amphetamine and related substances and other stimulants are
characterized by insomnia during intoxication and excessive sleepiness
during withdrawal. During acute intoxication, stimulants reduce the
total amount of sleep, increase sleep latency and sleep continuity
disturbances, and decrease REM sleep. Slow-wave sleep tends to be
reduced. During withdrawal from chronic stimulant use, there is both
prolonged nocturnal sleep duration and excessive daytime sleepiness.
Multiple sleep latency tests may show increased daytime sleepiness dur-

[]{#index_split_033.html#p463}**418**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

ing the withdrawal phase. Drugs like 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA; "ecstasy") and related substances lead to restless and disturbed
sleep within 48 hours of intake; frequent use of these compounds is
associated with persisting symptoms of anxiety, depression, and sleep
disturbances, even during longer-term abstinence.

Tobacco.

Chronic tobacco consumption is associated primarily with symptoms of
insomnia, decreased slow-wave sleep with a reduction of sleep
efficiency, and increased daytime sleepiness. Withdrawal from tobacco
can lead to impaired sleep. Individuals who smoke heavily may experience
regular nocturnal awakenings caused by tobacco craving.

Other or unknown substances/medications.

Other substances/medications may produce sleep disturbances,
particularly medications that affect the central or autonomic nervous
systems (e.g., adrenergic agonists and antagonists, dopamine agonists
and antagonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists, serotonergic
agonists and antagonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids).

Development and Course

Insomnia in children can be identified by either a parent or the child.
Often the child has a clear sleep disturbance associated with initiation
of a medication but may not report symptoms, although parents observe
the sleep disturbances. The use of some illicit substances (e.g.,
cannabis, ecstasy) is prevalent in adolescence and early adulthood.
Insomnia or any other sleep disturbance encountered in this age group
should prompt careful consideration of whether the sleep disturbance is
due to consumption of these substances.

Help-seeking behavior for the sleep disturbance in these age groups is
limited, and thus corroborative report may be elicited from a parent,
caregiver, or teacher. Older individuals take more medications and are
at increased risk for developing a substance/medication-induced sleep
disorder. They may interpret sleep disturbance as part of normal aging
and fail to report symptoms. Individuals with major neurocognitive
disorder (e.g., dementia) are at risk for substance/medication-induced
sleep disorders but may not report symptoms, making corroborative report
from caregiver(s) particularly important.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Risk and prognostic factors involved in substance abuse/dependence or
medication use are normative for certain age groups. They are relevant
for, and likely applicable to, the type of sleep disturbance encountered
(see the chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders" for
descriptions of respective substance use disorders).

Temperamental.

Substance use generally precipitates or accompanies insomnia in
vulnerable individuals. Thus, presence of insomnia in response to stress
or change in sleep environment or timing can represent a risk for
developing substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. A similar risk
may be present for individuals with other sleep disorders (e.g.,
individuals with hypersomnia who use stimulants).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The consumption of substances, including prescribed medications, may
depend in part on cultural background and specific local drug
regulations.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Gender-specific prevalences (i.e., females affected more than males at a
ratio of about 2:1) exist for patterns of consumption of some substances
(e.g., alcohol). The same amount and duration of consumption of a given
substance may lead to highly different sleep-related outcomes in males
and females based on, for example, gender-specific differences in
hepatic functioning.

[]{#index_split_033.html#p464}Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep
Disorder **419**

Diagnostic Markers

Each of the substance/medication-induced sleep disorders produces
electroencephalographic sleep patterns that are associated with, but
cannot be considered diagnostic of, other disorders. The
electroencephalographic sleep profile for each substance is related to
the stage of use, whether intake/intoxication, chronic use, or
withdrawal following discontinuation of the substance. All-night
polysomnography can help define the severity of insomnia complaints,
while the multiple sleep latency test provides information about the
severity of daytime sleepiness. Monitoring of nocturnal respiration and
periodic limb movements with polysomnography may verify a substance's
impact on nocturnal breathing and motor behavior. Sleep diaries for 2
weeks and actigraphy are considered helpful in confirming the presence
of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Drug screening can be of
use when the individual is not aware or unwilling to relate information
about substance intake.

Functional Consequences of

Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder

While there are many functional consequences associated with sleep
disorders, the only unique consequence for substance/medication-induced
sleep disorder is increased risk for relapse. The degree of sleep
disturbance during alcohol withdrawal (e.g., REM sleep rebound predicts
risk of relapse of drinking). Monitoring of sleep quality and daytime
sleepiness during and after withdrawal may provide clinically meaningful
information on whether an individual is at increased risk for relapse.

Differential Diagnosis

Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal. Sleep disturbances are
commonly encountered in the context of substance intoxication or
substance discontinuation/withdrawal. A diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder should be made instead of a
diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when
the sleep disturbance is predominant in the clinical picture and is
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Delirium.

If the substance/medication-induced sleep disturbance occurs exclusively
during the course of a delirium, it is not diagnosed separately.

Other sleep disorders.

A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is distinguished from
another sleep disorder if a substance/medication is judged to be
etiologically related to the symptoms. A substance/medication-induced
sleep disorder attributed to a prescribed medication for a mental
disorder or medical condition must have its onset while the individual
is receiving the medication or during discontinuation, if there is a
discontinuation/withdrawal syndrome associated with the medication. Once
treatment is discontinued, the sleep disturbance will usually remit
within days to several weeks. If symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks, other
causes for the sleep disturbance--related symptoms should be considered.
Not infrequently, individuals with another sleep disorder use
medications or drugs of abuse to self-medicate their symptoms (e.g.,
alcohol for management of insomnia). If the substance/

medication is judged to play a significant role in the exacerbation of
the sleep disturbance, an additional diagnosis of a
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder may be warranted.

Sleep disorder due to another medical condition.

Substance/medication-induced sleep

disorder and sleep disorder associated with another medical condition
may produce similar symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness, or a
parasomnia. Many individuals with other medical conditions that cause
sleep disturbance are treated with medications that may also cause sleep
disturbances. The chronology of symptoms is the most important factor in
distinguishing between these two sources of sleep symptoms. Difficulties
with sleep that clearly preceded the use of any medication for treatment
of a medical condition would []{#index_split_033.html#p465}**420**

Sleep-Wake Disorders

suggest a diagnosis of sleep disorder associated with another medical
condition. Conversely, sleep symptoms that appear only after the
initiation of a particular medication/

substance suggest a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. If the
disturbance is comorbid with another medical condition and is also
exacerbated by substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., sleep disorder
associated with another medical condition and substance/

medication-induced sleep disorder) are given. When there is insufficient
evidence to determine whether the sleep disturbance is attributable to a
substance/medication or to another medical condition or is primary
(i.e., not due to either a substance/medication or another medical
condition), a diagnosis of other specified sleep-wake disorder or
unspecified sleep-wake disorder is indicated.

Comorbidity

See the "Comorbidity" sections for other sleep disorders in this
chapter, including insomnia, hypersomnolence, central sleep apnea,
sleep-related hypoventilation, and circadian rhythm sleep-wake
disorders, shift work type.

Relationship to International Classification of

Sleep Disorders

The *International Classification of Sleep Disorders,* 2nd Edition
(ICSD-2), lists sleep disorders

"due to drug or substance" under their respective phenotypes (e.g.,
insomnia, hypersomnia).

Other Specified Insomnia Disorder

**780.52 (G47.09)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of insomnia disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for insomnia
disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic
class. The other specified insomnia disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for insomnia
disorder or any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by recording
"other specified insomnia disorder" followed by the specific reason
(e.g., "brief insomnia disorder").

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following:

1\. **Brief insomnia disorder:** Duration is less than 3 months.

2\. **Restricted to nonrestorative sleep:** Predominant complaint is
nonrestorative sleep unaccompanied by other sleep symptoms such as
difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep.

Unspecified Insomnia Disorder

**780.52 (G47.00)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of insomnia disorder that cause clinically significant distress or

Other Specified Hypersomnolence Disorder

**780.54 (G47.19)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of hypersomnolence disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
hypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake
disorders diagnostic class. The other specified hypersomnolence disorder
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to
communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any specific sleep-wake
disorder.

This is done by recording "other specified hypersomnolence disorder"
followed by the specific reason (e.g., "brief-duration hypersomnolence,"
as in Kleine-Levin syndrome).

Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder

**780.54 (G47.10)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of hypersomnolence disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
hypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake
disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified hypersomnolence disorder
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses *not* to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for hypersomnolence
disorder or a specific sleep-wake disorder, and includes presentations
in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis.

Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder

**780.59 (G47.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a sleep-wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do not
qualify for a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or other
specified hypersomnolence disorder. The other specified sleep-wake
disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet
the criteria for any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by
recording "other specified sleep-wake disorder" followed by the specific
reason (e.g., "repeated arousals during rapid eye movement sleep without
polysomnography or history of Parkinson's disease or other
synucleinopathy").

Unspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder

**780.59 (G47.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a sleep-wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do not
qualify for a diagnosis of unspecified insomnia disorder or unspecified
hypersomnolence disorder. The unspecified sleep-wake disorder category
is used in situations in which the clinician chooses *not* to specify
the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sleep-wake
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis.

[]{#index_split_033.html#p468}**Sexual**

**Dysfunctions**

Sexual dysfunctions include delayed ejaculation, erectile disorder,
female orgasmic disorder, female sexual interest/arousal disorder,
genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, male hypoactive sexual desire
disorder, premature (early) ejaculation, substance/medication-induced
sexual dysfunction, other specified sexual dysfunction, and unspecified
sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunctions are a heterogeneous group of
disorders that are typically characterized by a clinically significant
disturbance in a person's ability to respond sexually or to experience
sexual pleasure. An individual may have several sexual dysfunctions at
the same time. In such cases, all of the dysfunctions should be
diagnosed.

Clinical judgment should be used to determine if the sexual difficulties
are the result of inadequate sexual stimulation; in these cases, there
may still be a need for care, but a diagnosis of a sexual dysfunction
would not be made. These cases may include, but are not limited to,
conditions in which lack of knowledge about effective stimulation
prevents the experience of arousal or orgasm.

Subtypes are used to designate the onset of the difficulty. In many
individuals with sexual dysfunctions, the time of onset may indicate
different etiologies and interventions.

*Lifelong* refers to a sexual problem that has been present from first
sexual experiences, and *acquired* applies to sexual disorders that
develop after a period of relatively normal sexual function.
*Generalized* refers to sexual difficulties that are not limited to
certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners, and *situational*
refers to sexual difficulties that only occur with certain types of
stimulation, situations, or partners.

In addition to the lifelong/acquired and generalized/situational
subtypes, a number of factors must be considered during the assessment
of sexual dysfunction, given that they may be relevant to etiology
and/or treatment, and that may contribute, to varying degrees, across
individuals: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems;
partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor
communication; discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3)
individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image; history of
sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,
anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural or
religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against
sexual activity or pleasure; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical
factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment.

Clinical judgment about the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction should take
into consideration cultural factors that may influence expectations or
engender prohibitions about the experience of sexual pleasure. Aging may
be associated with a normative decrease in sexual response.

Sexual response has a requisite biological underpinning, yet is usually
experienced in an intrapersonal, interpersonal, and cultural context.
Thus, sexual function involves a complex interaction among biological,
sociocultural, and psychological factors. In many clinical contexts, a
precise understanding of the etiology of a sexual problem is unknown.
Nonetheless, a sexual dysfunction diagnosis requires ruling out problems
that are better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, by the effects
of a substance (e.g., drug or medication), by a medical condition (e.g.,
due to pelvic nerve damage), or by severe relationship distress, partner
violence, or other stressors.

If the sexual dysfunction is mostly explainable by another nonsexual
mental disorder (e.g., depressive or bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder, psychotic dis-423

[]{#index_split_033.html#p469}**424**

Sexual Dysfunctions

order), then only the other mental disorder diagnosis should be made. If
the problem is thought to be better explained by the use/misuse or
discontinuation of a drug or substance, it should be diagnosed
accordingly as a substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction. If the
sexual dysfunction is attributable to another medical condition (e.g.,
peripheral neuropathy), the individual would not receive a psychiatric
diagnosis. If severe relationship distress, partner violence, or
significant stressors better explain the sexual difficulties, then a
sexual dysfunction diagnosis is not made, but an appropriate V or Z code
for the relationship problem or stressor may be listed. In many cases, a
precise etiological relationship between another condition (e.g., a
medical condition) and a sexual dysfunction cannot be established.

*Specify* whether:

**Lifelong:** The disturbance has been present since the individual
became sexually active.

sexual function.

*Specify* whether:

**Generalized:** Not limited to certain types of stimulation,

situations, or partners.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

**Moderate:** Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

**Severe:** Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features

The distinguishing feature of delayed ejaculation is a marked delay in
or inability to achieve ejaculation (Criterion A). The man reports
difficulty or inability to ejaculate despite the presence of adequate
sexual stimulation and the desire to ejaculate. The presenting complaint
usually involves partnered sexual activity. In most cases, the diagnosis
will be made by self-report of the individual. The definition of "delay"
does not have precise boundaries, as there is noconsensus as to what
constitutes a reasonable time to reach orgasm or what is unacceptably
long for most men and their sexual partners.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The man and his partner may report prolonged thrusting to achieve orgasm
to the point of exhaustion or genital discomfort and then ceasing
efforts. Some men may report avoiding

[]{#index_split_033.html#p470}Delayed Ejaculation

**425**

sexual activity because of a repetitive pattern of difficulty
ejaculating. Some sexual partners may report feeling less sexually
attractive because their partner cannot ejaculate easily.

In addition to the subtypes "lifelong/acquired" and
"generalized/situational," the following five factors must be considered
during assessment and diagnosis of delayed ejaculation, given that they
may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g.,
partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship
factors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual
activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image;
history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g.,
depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4)
cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions
against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical
factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these
factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of
different men with this disorder.

Prevalence

Prevalence is unclear because of the lack of a precise definition of
this syndrome. It is the least common male sexual complaint. Only 75% of
men report always ejaculating during sexual activity, and less than 1%
of men will complain of problems with reaching ejaculation that last
more than 6 months.

Development and Course

Lifelong delayed ejaculation begins with early sexual experiences and
continues throughout life. By definition, acquired delayed ejaculation
begins after a period of normal sexual function. There is minimal
evidence concerning the course of acquired delayed ejaculation. The
prevalence of delayed ejaculation appears to remain relatively constant
until around age 50 years, when the incidence begins to increase
significantly. Men in their 80s report twice as much difficulty
ejaculating as men younger than 59 years.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Age-related loss of the fast-conducting peripheral sensory nerves and
age-related decreased sex steroid secretion may be associated with the
increase in delayed ejaculation in men older than 50 years.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Complaints of ejaculatory delay vary across countries and cultures. Such
complaints are more common among men in Asian populations than in men
living in Europe, Australia, or the United States. This variation may be
attributable to cultural or genetic differences between cultures.

Functional Consequences of Delayed Ejaculation

Difficulty with ejaculation may contribute to difficulties in
conception. Delayed ejaculation is often associated with considerable
psychological distress in one or both partners.

Differential Diagnosis

Another medical condition.

The major differential diagnosis is between delayed ejaculation fully
explained by another medical illness or injury and delayed ejaculation
with a psychogenic, idiopathic, or combined psychological and medical
etiology. A situational aspect to the complaint is suggestive of a
psychological basis for the problem (e.g., men who can ejaculate during
sexual activity with one sex but not the other; men who can ejaculate
with one partner but not another of the same sex; men with paraphilic
arousal pat-

[]{#index_split_033.html#p471}**426**

Sexual Dysfunctions

terns; men who require highly ritualized activity to ejaculate during
partnered sexual activity). Another medical illness or injury may
produce delays in ejaculation independent of psychological issues. For
example, inability to ejaculate can be caused by interruption of the
nerve supply to the genitals, such as can occur after traumatic surgical
injury to the lumbar sympathetic ganglia, abdominoperitoneal surgery, or
lumbar sympathectomy.

Ejaculation is thought to be under autonomic nervous system control
involving the hypo-gastric (sympathetic) and pudendal (parasympathetic)
nerves. A number of neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple
sclerosis and diabetic and alcoholic neuropathy, can cause inability to
ejaculate. Delayed ejaculation should also be differentiated from
retro-grade ejaculation (i.e., ejaculation into the bladder), which may
follow transurethral prostatic resection.

Substance/medication use.

A number of pharmacological agents, such as antidepressants,
antipsychotics, alpha sympathetic drugs, and opioid drugs, can cause
ejaculatory problems.

Dysfunction with orgasm.

It is important in the history to ascertain whether the complaint
concerns delayed ejaculation or the sensation of orgasm, or both.
Ejaculation occurs in the genitals, whereas the experience of orgasm is
believed to be primarily subjective.

Ejaculation and orgasm usually occur together but not always. For
example, a man with a normal ejaculatory pattern may complain of
decreased pleasure (i.e., anhedonic ejaculation). Such a complaint would
not be coded as delayed ejaculation but could be coded as other
specified sexual dysfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction.

Comorbidity

There is some evidence to suggest that delayed ejaculation may be more
common in severe forms of major depressive disorder.

Erectile Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.72 (F52.21)**

A. At least one of the three following symptoms must be experienced on
almost all or all (approximately 75%--100%) occasions of sexual activity
(in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all
contexts):

1\. Marked difficulty in obtaining an erection during sexual activity.

2\. Marked difficulty in maintaining an erection until the completion of
sexual activity.

3\. Marked decrease in erectile rigidity.

B. The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of
approximately 6 months.

C. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in
the individual.

D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental
disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress or other
significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects of a
substance/medication or another medical condition.

*Specify* whether:

**Lifelong:** The disturbance has been present since the individual
became sexually active.

**Acquired:** The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal
sexual function.

*Specify* whether:

**Generalized:** Not limited to certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners.

**Situational:** Only occurs with certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners.

**427**

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

**Moderate:** Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

**Severe:** Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of erectile disorder is the repeated failure to
obtain or maintain erections during partnered sexual activities
(Criterion A). A careful sexual history is necessary to ascertain that
the problem has been present for a significant duration of time (i.e.,
at least approximately 6 months) and occurs on the majority of sexual
occasions (i.e., at least 75%

of the time). Symptoms may occur only in specific situations involving
certain types of stimulation or partners, or they may occur in a
generalized manner in all types of situations, stimulation, or partners.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Many men with erectile disorder may have low self-esteem, low
self-confidence, and a decreased sense of masculinity, and may
experience depressed affect. Fear and/or avoidance of future sexual
encounters may occur. Decreased sexual satisfaction and reduced sexual
desire in the individual's partner are common.

In addition to the subtypes "lifelong/acquired" and
"generalized/situational," the following five factors must be considered
during assessment and diagnosis of erectile disorder given that they may
be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g.,
partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship
factors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual
activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image,
history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g.,
depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4)
cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions
against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical
factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these
factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of
different men with this disorder.

Prevalence

The prevalence of lifelong versus acquired erectile disorder is unknown.
There is a strong age-related increase in both prevalence and incidence
of problems with erection, particularly after age 50 years.
Approximately 13%--21% of men ages 40--80 years complain of occasional
problems with erections. Approximately 2% of men younger than age 40--50
years complain of frequent problems with erections, whereas 40%--50% of
men older than 60--70

years may have significant problems with erections. About 20% of men
fear erectile problems on their first sexual experience, whereas
approximately 8% experienced erectile problems that hindered penetration
during their first sexual experience.

Development and Course

Erectile failure on first sexual attempt has been found to be related to
having sex with a previously unknown partner, concomitant use of drugs
or alcohol, not wanting to have sex, and peer pressure. There is minimal
evidence regarding the persistence of such problems after the first
attempt. It is assumed that most of these problems spontaneously remit
without professional intervention, but some men may continue to have
episodic problems. In contrast, acquired erectile disorder is often
associated with biological factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. Acquired erectile disorder is likely to be persistent in most
men.

The natural history of lifelong erectile disorder is unknown. Clinical
observation supports the association of lifelong erectile disorder with
psychological factors that are self-

[]{#index_split_033.html#p473}**428**

Sexual Dysfunctions

limiting or responsive to psychological interventions, whereas, as noted
above, acquired erectile disorder is more likely to be related to
biological factors and to be persistent. The incidence of erectile
disorder increases with age. A minority of men diagnosed as having
moderate erectile failure may experience spontaneous remission of
symptoms without medical intervention. Distress associated with erectile
disorder is lower in older men as compared with younger men.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Neurotic personality traits may be associated with erectile problems in
college students, and submissive personality traits may be associated
with erectile problems in men age 40 years and older. *Alexithymia*
(i.e., deficits in cognitive processing of emotions) is common in men
diagnosed with "psychogenic" erectile dysfunction. Erectile problems are
common in men diagnosed with depression and posttraumatic stress
disorder.

Course modifiers.

Risk factors for acquired erectile disorder include age, smoking
tobacco, lack of physical exercise, diabetes, and decreased desire.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Complaints of erectile disorder have been found to vary across
countries. It is unclear to what extent these differences represent
differences in cultural expectations as opposed to genuine differences
in the frequency of erectile failure.

Diagnostic Markers

Nocturnal penile tumescence testing and measured erectile turgidity
during sleep can be employed to help differentiate organic from
psychogenic erectile problems on the assumption that adequate erections
during rapid eye movement sleep indicate a psychological etiology to the
problem. A number of other diagnostic procedures may be employed
depending on the clinician's assessment of their relevance given the
individual's age, comorbid medical problems, and clinical presentation.
Doppler ultrasonography and intra-vascular injection of vasoactive
drugs, as well as invasive diagnostic procedures such as dynamic
infusion cavernosography, can be used to assess vascular integrity.
Pudendal nerve conduction studies, including somatosensory evoked
potentials, can be employed when a peripheral neuropathy is suspected.
In men also complaining of decreased sexual desire, serum bioavailable
or free testosterone is frequently assessed to determine if the
difficulty is secondary to endocrinological factors. Thyroid function
may also be assessed.

Determination of fasting serum glucose is useful to screen for the
presence of diabetes mellitus. The assessment of serum lipids is
important, as erectile disorder in men 40 years and older is predictive
of the future risk of coronary artery disease.

Functional Consequences of Erectile Disorder

Erectile disorder can interfere with fertility and produce both
individual and interpersonal distress. Fear and/or avoidance of sexual
encounters may interfere with the ability to develop intimate
relationships.

Differential Diagnosis

Nonsexual mental disorders.

Major depressive disorder and erectile disorder are closely associated,
and erectile disorder accompanying severe depressive disorder may occur.

Normal erectile function.

The differential should include consideration of normal erectile
function in men with excessive expectations.

[]{#index_split_033.html#p474}Female Orgasmic Disorder

**429**

Substance/medication use.

Another major differential diagnosis is whether the erectile problem is
secondary to substance/medication use. An onset that coincides with the
beginning of substance/medication use and that dissipates with
discontinuation of the substance/medication or dose reduction is
suggestive of a substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.

Another medical condition.

The most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis of erectile
disorder is ruling out erectile problems that are fully explained by
medical factors. Such cases would not receive a diagnosis of a mental
disorder. The distinction between erectile disorder as a mental disorder
and erectile dysfunction as the result of another medical condition is
usually unclear, and many cases will have complex, interactive
biological and psychiatric etiologies. If the individual is older than
40--50 years and/or has concomitant medical problems, the differential
diagnosis should include medical etiologies, especially vascular
disease. The presence of an organic disease known to cause erectile
problems does not confirm a causal relationship. For example, a man with
diabetes mellitus can develop erectile disorder in response to
psychological stress. In general, erectile dysfunction due to organic
factors is generalized and gradual in onset. An exception would be
erectile problems after traumatic injury to the nervous innervation of
the genital organs (e.g., spinal cord injury).

Erectile problems that are situational and inconsistent and that have an
acute onset after a stressful life event are most often due to
psychological events. An age of less than 40 years is also suggestive of
a psychological etiology to the difficulty.

Other sexual dysfunctions.

Erectile disorder may coexist with premature (early) ejaculation and
male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

Comorbidity

Erectile disorder can be comorbid with other sexual diagnoses, such as
premature (early) ejaculation and male hypoactive sexual desire
disorder, as well as with anxiety and depressive disorders. Erectile
disorder is common in men with lower urinary tract symptoms related to
prostatic hypertrophy. Erectile disorder may be comorbid with
dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypogonadism, multiple sclerosis,
diabetes mellitus, and other diseases that interfere with the vascular,
neurological, or endocrine function necessary for normal erectile
function.

Relationship to International Classification of Diseases Erectile
response is coded as failure of genital response in ICD-10 (F2.2).

Female Orgasmic Disorder

became sexually active.

**Acquired:** The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal
sexual function.

*Specify* whether:

**Generalized:** Not limited to certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners.

*Specify* if:

**Never experienced an orgasm under any situation.**

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

**Moderate:** Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in

**Severe:** Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features

Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by difficulty experiencing
orgasm and/or markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations
(Criterion A). Women show wide variability in the type or intensity of
stimulation that elicits orgasm. Similarly, subjective descriptions of
orgasm are extremely varied, suggesting that it is experienced in very
different ways, both across women and on different occasions by the same
woman. For a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder, symptoms must be
experienced on almost all or all (approximately 75%--100%) occasions of
sexual activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized,
in all contexts) and have a minimum duration of approximately 6 months.

The use of the minimum severity and duration criteria is intended to
distinguish transient orgasm difficulties from more persistent orgasmic
dysfunction. The inclusion of "approximately" in Criterion B allows for
clinician judgment in cases in which symptom duration does not meet the
recommended 6-month threshold.

For a woman to have a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder, clinically
significant distress must accompany the symptoms (Criterion C). In many
cases of orgasm problems, the causes are multifactorial or cannot be
determined. If female orgasmic disorder is deemed to be better explained
by another mental disorder, the effects of a substance/medication, or a
medical condition, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would
not be made.

Finally, if interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as
severe relationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other
significant stressors, are present, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic
disorder would not be made.

Many women require clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm, and a
relatively small proportion of women report that they always experience
orgasm during penile-vaginal intercourse. Thus, a woman's experiencing
orgasm through clitoral stimulation but not during intercourse does not
meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. It
is also important to consider whether orgasmic difficulties are the
result of inadequate sexual stimulation; in these cases, there may still
be a need for care, but a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would
not be made.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Associations between specific patterns of personality traits or
psychopathology and orgasmic dysfunction have generally not been
supported. Compared with women without the disorder, some women with
female orgasmic disorder may have greater difficulty communicating about
sexual issues. Overall sexual satisfaction, however, is not strongly
correlated with orgasmic experience. Many women report high levels of
sexual satisfaction

[]{#index_split_033.html#p476}Female Orgasmic Disorder

**431**

despite rarely or never experiencing orgasm. Orgasmic difficulties in
women often co-occur with problems related to sexual interest and
arousal.

In addition to the subtypes "lifelong/acquired" and
"generalized/situational," the following five factors must be considered
during assessment and diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder given that
they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors
(e.g., partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2)
relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire
for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor
body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric
comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss,
bereavement); (4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related
to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality);
and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each
of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms
of different women with this disorder.

Prevalence

Reported prevalence rates for female orgasmic problems in women vary
widely, from 10%

to 42%, depending on multiple factors (e.g., age, culture, duration, and
severity of symptoms); however, these estimates do not take into account
the presence of distress. Only a proportion of women experiencing orgasm
difficulties also report associated distress.

Variation in how symptoms are assessed (e.g., the duration of symptoms
and the recall period) also influence prevalence rates. Approximately
10% of women do not experience orgasm throughout their lifetime.

Development and Course

By definition, lifelong female orgasmic disorder indicates that the
orgasmic difficulties have always been present, whereas the acquired
subtype would be assigned if the woman's orgasmic difficulties developed
after a period of normal orgasmic functioning.

A woman's first experience of orgasm can occur any time from the
prepubertal period to well into adulthood. Women show a more variable
pattern in age at first orgasm than do men, and women's reports of
having experienced orgasm increase with age. Many women learn to
experience orgasm as they experience a wide variety of stimulation and
acquire more knowledge about their bodies. Women's rates of orgasm
consistency (defined as

"usually or always" experiencing orgasm) are higher during masturbation
than during sexual activity with a partner.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

A wide range of psychological factors, such as anxiety and concerns
about pregnancy, can potentially interfere with a woman's ability to
experience orgasm.

Environmental.

There is a strong association between relationship problems, physical
health, and mental health and orgasm difficulties in women.
Sociocultural factors (e.g., gender role expectations and religious
norms) are also important influences on the experience of orgasmic
difficulties.

Genetic and physiological.

Many physiological factors may influence a woman's experience of orgasm,
including medical conditions and medications. Conditions such as
multiple sclerosis, pelvic nerve damage from radical hysterectomy, and
spinal cord injury can all influence orgasmic functioning in women.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are known to delay or inhibit
orgasm in women. Women with vulvovaginal atrophy (characterized by
symptoms such as vaginal dryness, itching, and pain) are significantly
more likely to report orgasm difficulties than are women without this
condition. Menopausal status is not consistently associated with the
likelihood of orgasm difficulties. There may be a significant genetic
contribution to variation in female orgasmic function. However,
[]{#index_split_033.html#p477}**432**

Sexual Dysfunctions

psychological, sociocultural, and physiological factors likely interact
in complex ways to influence women's experience of orgasm and of orgasm
difficulties.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The degree to which lack of orgasm in women is regarded as a problem
that requires treatment may vary depending on cultural context. In
addition, women differ in how important orgasm is to their sexual
satisfaction. There may be marked sociocultural and generational
differences in women's orgasmic ability. For example, the prevalence of
inability to reach orgasm has ranged from 17.7% (in Northern Europe) to
42.2% (in Southeast Asia).

Diagnostic Markers

Although measurable physiological changes occur during female orgasm,
including changes in hormones, pelvic floor musculature, and brain
activation, there is significant variability in these indicators of
orgasm across women. In clinical situations, the diagnosis of female
orgasmic disorder is based on a woman's self-report.

Functional Consequences of Female Orgasmic Disorder

The functional consequences of female orgasmic disorder are unclear.
Although there is a strong association between relationship problems and
orgasmic difficulties in women, it is unclear whether relationship
factors are risk factors for orgasmic difficulties or are consequences
of those difficulties.

Differential Diagnosis

Nonsexual mental disorders.

Nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive

disorder, which is characterized by markedly diminished interest or
pleasure in all, or almost all, activities, may explain female orgasmic
disorder. If the orgasmic difficulties are better explained by another
mental disorder, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not
be made.

Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.

Substance/medication use may

explain the orgasmic difficulties.

Another medical condition.

If the disorder is due to another medical condition (e.g., multiple
sclerosis, spinal cord injury), then a diagnosis of female orgasmic
disorder would not be made.

Interpersonal factors.

If interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe
relationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant
stressors, are associated with the orgasmic difficulties, then a
diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made.

Other sexual dysfunctions.

Female orgasmic disorder may occur in association with other sexual
dysfunctions (e.g., female sexual interest/arousal disorder). The
presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of
female orgasmic disorder. Occasional orgasmic difficulties that are
short-term or infrequent and are not accompanied by clinically
significant distress or impairment are not diagnosed as female orgasmic
disorder. A diagnosis is also not appropriate if the problems are the
result of inadequate sexual stimulation.

Comorbidity

Women with female orgasmic disorder may have co-occurring sexual
interest/arousal difficulties. Women with diagnoses of other nonsexual
mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, may experience
lower sexual interest/arousal, and this may indirectly increase the
likelihood of orgasmic difficulties.

**433**

Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.72 (F52.22)**

A. Lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual interest/arousal, as
manifested by at least three of the following:

1\. Absent/reduced interest in sexual activity.

2\. Absent/reduced sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies.

3\. No/reduced initiation of sexual activity, and typically unreceptive
to a partner's attempts to initiate.

4\. Absent/reduced sexual excitement/pleasure during sexual activity in
almost all or all (approximately 75%--100%) sexual encounters (in
identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts).

5\. Absent/reduced sexual interest/arousal in response to any internal
or external sexual/erotic cues (e.g., written, verbal, visual).

6\. Absent/reduced genital or nongenital sensations during sexual
activity in almost all or all (approximately 75%--100%) sexual
encounters (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in
all contexts).

B. The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of
approximately 6 months.

C. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in
the individual.

D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental
disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress (e.g.,
partner violence) or other significant stressors and is not attributable
to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition.

*Specify* whether:

**Lifelong:** The disturbance has been present since the individual
became sexually active.

**Acquired:** The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal
sexual function.

*Specify* whether:

**Generalized:** Not limited to certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners.

**Situational:** Only occurs with certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

**Moderate:** Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

**Severe:** Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features

In assessing female sexual interest/arousal disorder, interpersonal
context must be taken into account. A "desire discrepancy," in which a
woman has lower desire for sexual activity than her partner, is not
sufficient to diagnose female sexual interest/arousal disorder.

In order for the criteria for the disorder to be met, there must be
absence or reduced frequency or intensity of at least three of six
indicators (Criterion A) for a minimum duration of approximately 6
months (Criterion B). There may be different symptom profiles across
women, as well as variability in how sexual interest and arousal are
expressed. For example, in one woman, sexual interest/arousal disorder
may be expressed as a lack of interest in sexual activity, an absence of
erotic or sexual thoughts, and reluctance to initiate sexual activity
and respond to a partner's sexual invitations. In another woman, an
inability to become sexually excited, to respond to sexual stimuli with
sexual desire, and a correspond-

[]{#index_split_033.html#p479}**434**

Sexual Dysfunctions

ing lack of signs of physical sexual arousal may be the primary
features. Because sexual desire and arousal frequently coexist and are
elicited in response to adequate sexual cues, the criteria for female
sexual interest/arousal disorder take into account that difficulties in
desire and arousal often simultaneously characterize the complaints of
women with this disorder. Short-term changes in sexual interest or
arousal are common and may be adaptive responses to events in a woman's
life and do not represent a sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis of female
sexual interest/arousal disorder requires a minimum duration of symptoms
of approximately 6 months as a reflection that the symptoms must be a
persistent problem.

The estimation of persistence may be determined by clinical judgment
when a duration of 6 months cannot be ascertained precisely.

There may be absent or reduced frequency or intensity of interest in
sexual activity (Criterion A1), which was previously termed *hypoactive
sexual desire disorder.* The frequency or intensity of sexual and erotic
thoughts or fantasies may be absent or reduced (Criterion A2). The
expression of fantasies varies widely across women and may include
memories of past sexual experiences. The normative decline in sexual
thoughts with age should be taken into account when this criterion is
being assessed. Absence or reduced frequency of initiating sexual
activity and of receptivity to a partner's sexual invitations (Criterion
A3) is a behaviorally focused criterion. A couple's beliefs and
preferences for sexual initiation patterns are highly relevant to the
assessment of this criterion. There may be absent or reduced sexual
excitement or pleasure during sexual activity in almost all or all
(approximately 75%--100%) sexual encounters (Criterion A4). Lack of
pleasure is a common presenting clinical complaint in women with low
desire. Among women who report low sexual desire, there are fewer sexual
or erotic cues that elicit sexual interest or arousal (i.e., there is a
lack of "responsive desire"). Assessment of the adequacy of sexual
stimuli will assist in determining if there is a difficulty with
responsive sexual desire (Criterion A5). Frequency or intensity of
genital or nongenital sensations during sexual activity may be reduced
or absent (Criterion A6). This may include reduced vaginal
lubrication/vasocongestion, but because physiological measures of
genital sexual response do not differentiate women who report sexual
arousal concerns from those who do not, the self-report of reduced or
absent genital or nongenital sensations is sufficient.

For a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder to be made,
clinically significant distress must accompany the symptoms in Criterion
A. Distress may be experienced as a result of the lack of sexual
interest/arousal or as a result of significant interference in a woman's
life and well-being. If a lifelong lack of sexual desire is better
explained by one's self-identification as "asexual," then a diagnosis of
female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Female sexual interest/arousal disorder is frequently associated with
problems in experiencing orgasm, pain experienced during sexual
activity, infrequent sexual activity, and couple-level discrepancies in
desire. Relationship difficulties and mood disorders are also frequently
associated features of female sexual interest/arousal disorder.
Unrealistic expectations and norms regarding the "appropriate" level of
sexual interest or arousal, along with poor sexual techniques and lack
of information about sexuality, may also be evident in women diagnosed
with female sexual interest/arousal disorder. The latter, as well as
normative beliefs about gender roles, are important factors to consider.

In addition to the subtypes "lifelong/acquired" and
"generalized/situational," the following five factors must be considered
during assessment and diagnosis of female sexual interest/

arousal disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or
treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems,
partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor
communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3)
individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of
sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,
anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4)
cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions
against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and

**435**

5\) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Note
that each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting
symptoms of different women with this disorder.

Prevalence

The prevalence of female sexual interest/arousal disorder, as defined in
this manual, is unknown. The prevalence of low sexual desire and of
problems with sexual arousal (with and without associated distress), as
defined by DSM-IV or ICD-10, may vary markedly in relation to age,
cultural setting, duration of symptoms, and presence of distress.
Regarding duration of symptoms, there are striking differences in
prevalence estimates between short-term and persistent problems related
to lack of sexual interest. When distress about sexual functioning is
required, prevalence estimates are markedly lower. Some older women
report less distress about low sexual desire than younger women,
although sexual desire may decrease with age.

Development and Course

By definition, lifelong female sexual interest/arousal disorder suggests
that the lack of sexual interest or arousal has been present for the
woman's entire sexual life. For Criteria A3, A4, and A6, which assess
functioning during sexual activity, a subtype of lifelong would mean
presence of symptoms since the individual's first sexual experiences.
The acquired subtype would be assigned if the difficulties with sexual
interest or arousal developed after a period of nonproblematic sexual
functioning. Adaptive and normative changes in sexual functioning may
result from partner-related, interpersonal, or personal events and may
be transient in nature. However, persistence of symptoms for
approximately 6 months or more would constitute a sexual dysfunction.

There are normative changes in sexual interest and arousal across the
life span. Furthermore, women in relationships of longer duration are
more likely to report engaging in sex despite no obvious feelings of
sexual desire at the outset of a sexual encounter compared with women in
shorter-duration relationships. Vaginal dryness in older women is
related to age and menopausal status.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Temperamental factors include negative cognitions and attitudes about
sexuality and past history of mental disorders. Differences in
propensity for sexual excitation and sexual inhibition may also predict
the likelihood of developing sexual problems.

Environmental.

Environmental factors include relationship difficulties, partner sexual
functioning, and developmental history, such as early relationships with
caregivers and childhood stressors.

Genetic and physiological.

Some medical conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction)
can be risk factors for female sexual interest/arousal disorder. There
appears to be a strong influence of genetic factors on vulnerability to
sexual problems in women.

Psychophysiological research using vaginal photoplethysmography has not
found differences between women with and without perceived lack of
genital arousal.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

There is marked variability in prevalence rates of low desire across
cultures. Lower rates of sexual desire may be more common among East
Asian women compared with Euro-Canadian women. Although the lower levels
of sexual desire and arousal found in men and women from East Asian
countries compared with Euro-American groups may reflect less interest
in sex in those cultures, the possibility remains that such group
differences are an artifact of the measures used to quantify desire. A
judgment about whether low sexual []{#index_split_033.html#p481}**436**

Sexual Dysfunctions

desire reported by a woman from a certain ethnocultural group meets
criteria for female sexual interest/arousal disorder must take into
account the fact that different cultures may pathologize some behaviors
and not others.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

By definition, the diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder
is only given to women. Distressing difficulties with sexual desire in
men would be considered under male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

Functional Consequences of

Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder

Difficulties in sexual interest/arousal are often associated with
decreased relationship satisfaction.

Differential Diagnosis

Nonsexual mental disorders.

Nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive

disorder, in which there is "markedly diminished interest or pleasure in
all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day," may
explain the lack of sexual interest/

arousal. If the lack of interest or arousal is completely attributable
to another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of female sexual
interest/arousal disorder would not be made.

Substance/medication use.

Substance or medication use may explain the lack of interest/arousal.

Another medical condition.

If the sexual symptoms are considered to be almost exclusively
associated with the effects of another medical condition (e.g., diabetes
mellitus, en-dothelial disease, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous
system disease), then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal
disorder would not be made.

Interpersonal factors.

If interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe
relationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant
stressors, explain the sexual interest/arousal symptoms, then a
diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made.

Other sexual dysfunctions.

The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis
of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. It is common for women to
experience more than one sexual dysfunction. For example, the presence
of chronic genital pain may lead to a lack of desire for the (painful)
sexual activity. Lack of interest and arousal during sexual activity may
impair orgasmic ability. For some women, all aspects of the sexual
response may be unsatisfying and distressing.

Inadequate or absent sexual stimuli.

When differential diagnoses are being considered,

it is important to assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the
woman's sexual experience. In cases where inadequate or absent sexual
stimuli are contributing to the clinical picture, there may be evidence
for clinical care, but a sexual dysfunction diagnosis would not be made.
Similarly, transient and adaptive alterations in sexual functioning that
are secondary to a significant life or personal event must be considered
in the differential diagnosis.

Comorbidity

Comorbidity between sexual interest/arousal problems and other sexual
difficulties is extremely common. Sexual distress and dissatisfaction
with sex life are also highly correlated in women with low sexual
desire. Distressing low desire is associated with depression, thyroid
problems, anxiety, urinary incontinence, and other medical factors.
Arthritis and inflammatory or irritable bowel disease are also
associated with sexual arousal prob-

lems. Low desire appears to be comorbid with depression, sexual and
physical abuse in adulthood, global mental functioning, and use of
alcohol.

Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.76 (F52.6)**

A. Persistent or recurrent difficulties with one (or more) of the
following: 1. Vaginal penetration during intercourse.

2\. Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or
penetration attempts.

3\. Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in
anticipation of, during, or as a result of vaginal penetration.

4\. Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during
attempted vaginal penetration.

B. The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of
approximately 6 months.

C. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in
the individual.

D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental
disorder or as a consequence of a severe relationship distress (e.g.,
partner violence) or other significant stressors and is not attributable
to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition.

*Specify* whether:

**Lifelong:** The disturbance has been present since the individual
became sexually active.

**Acquired:** The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal
sexual function.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

**Moderate:** Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

**Severe:** Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features

Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder refers to four commonly comorbid
symptom dimensions: 1) difficulty having intercourse, 2) genito-pelvic
pain, 3) fear of pain or vaginal penetration, and 4) tension of the
pelvic floor muscles (Criterion A). Because major difficulty in any one
of these symptom dimensions is often sufficient to cause clinically
significant distress, a diagnosis can be made on the basis of marked
difficulty in only one symptom dimension. However, all four symptom
dimensions should be assessed even if a diagnosis can be made on the
basis of only one symptom dimension.

*Marked difficulty having vaginal intercourse/penetration* (Criterion
A1) can vary from a total inability to experience vaginal penetration in
any situation (e.g., intercourse, gynecological examinations, tampon
insertion) to the ability to easily experience penetration in one
situation and but not in another. Although the most common clinical
situation is when a woman is unable to experience intercourse or
penetration with a partner, difficulties in undergoing required
gynecological examinations may also be present. *Marked vulvovaginal or
pelvic pain* *during vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts*
(Criterion A2) refers to pain occurring in different locations in the
genito-pelvic area. Location of pain as well as intensity should be
assessed.

Typically, pain can be characterized as superficial (vulvovaginal or
occurring during penetration) or deep (pelvic; i.e., not felt until
deeper penetration). The intensity of the pain is often not linearly
related to distress or interference with sexual intercourse or other
sexual activities.

Some genito-pelvic pain only occurs when provoked (i.e., by intercourse
or mechanical stim-

[]{#index_split_033.html#p483}**438**

Sexual Dysfunctions

ulation); other genito-pelvic pain may be spontaneous as well as
provoked. Genito-pelvic pain can also be usefully characterized
qualitatively (e.g., "burning," "cutting," "shooting," "throbbing"). The
pain may persist for a period after intercourse is completed and may
also occur during urination. Typically, the pain experienced during
sexual intercourse can be reproduced during a gynecological examination.

*Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain either in
anticipation of, or during, or* *as a result of vaginal penetration*
(Criterion A3) is commonly reported by women who have regularly
experienced pain during sexual intercourse. This "normal" reaction may
lead to avoidance of sexual/intimate situations. In other cases, this
marked fear does not appear to be closely related to the experience of
pain but nonetheless leads to avoidance of intercourse and vaginal
penetration situations. Some have described this as similar to a phobic
reaction except that the phobic object may be vaginal penetration or the
fear of pain.

*Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during
attempted vaginal penetration* (Criterion A4) can vary from
reflexive-like spasm of the pelvic floor in response to attempted
vaginal entry to "normal/voluntary" muscle guarding in response to the
anticipated or the repeated experience of pain or to fear or anxiety. In
the case of "normal/

guarding" reactions, penetration may be possible under circumstances of
relaxation. The characterization and assessment of pelvic floor
dysfunction is often best undertaken by a specialist gynecologist or by
a pelvic floor physical therapist.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is frequently associated with
other sexual dysfunctions, particularly reduced sexual desire and
interest (female sexual interest/arousal disorder). Sometimes desire and
interest are preserved in sexual situations that are not painful or do
not require penetration. Even when individuals with genito-pelvic
pain/penetration disorder report sexual interest/motivation, there is
often behavioral avoidance of sexual situations and opportunities.
Avoidance of gynecological examinations despite medical recommendations
is also frequent. The pattern of avoidance is similar to that seen in
phobic disorders. It is common for women who have not succeeded in
having sexual intercourse to come for treatment only when they wish to
conceive. Many women with genito-pelvic pain/

penetration disorder will experience associated relationship/marital
problems; they also often report that the symptoms significantly
diminish their feelings of femininity.

In addition to the subtype "lifelong/acquired," five factors should be
considered during assessment and diagnosis of genito-pelvic
pain/penetration disorder because they may be relevant to etiology
and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems,
partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor
communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3)
individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of
sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,
anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4)
cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions
against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical
factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these
factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of
different women with this disorder.

There are no valid physiological measures of any of the component
symptom dimensions of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Validated
psychometric inventories may be used to formally assess the pain and
anxiety components related to genito-pelvic pain/

penetration disorder.

Prevalence

The prevalence of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is unknown.
However, approximately 15% of women in North America report recurrent
pain during intercourse. Difficulties having intercourse appear to be a
frequent referral to sexual dysfunction clinics and to specialist
clinicians.

[]{#index_split_033.html#p484}Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder
**439**

Development and Course

The development and course of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is
unclear. Because women generally do not seek treatment until they
experience problems in sexual functioning, it can, in general, be
difficult to characterize genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder as
lifelong (primary) or acquired (secondary). Although women typically
come to clinical attention after the initiation of sexual activity,
there are often earlier clinical signs. For example, difficulty with or
the avoidance of use of tampons is an important predictor of later
problems.

Difficulties with vaginal penetration (inability or fear or pain) may
not be obvious until sexual intercourse is attempted. Even once
intercourse is attempted, the frequency of attempts may not be
significant or regular. In cases where it is difficult to establish
whether symptomatology is lifelong or acquired, it is useful to
determine the presence of any consistent period of successful pain-,
fear-, and tension-free intercourse. If the experience of such a period
can be established, then genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder can be
characterized as acquired. Once symptomatology is well established for a
period of approximately 6 months, the probability of spontaneous and
significant symptomatic remission appears to diminish.

Complaints related to genito-pelvic pain peak during early adulthood and
in the peri-and postmenopausal period. Women with complaints about
difficulty having intercourse appear to be primarily premenopausal.
There may also be an increase in genito-pelvic pain--related symptoms in
the postpartum period.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Sexual and/or physical abuse have often been cited as predictors of the
DSM-IV-defined sexual pain disorders dyspareunia and vaginismus. This is
a matter of controversy in the current literature.

Genetic and physiological.

Women experiencing superficial pain during sexual intercourse often
report the onset of the pain after a history of vaginal infections. Even
after the infections have resolved and there are no known residual
physical findings, the pain persists.

Pain during tampon insertion or the inability to insert tampons before
any sexual contact has been attempted is an important risk factor for
genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

In the past, inadequate sexual education and religious orthodoxy have
often been considered to be culturally related predisposing factors to
the DSM-IV diagnosis of vaginismus.

This perception appears to be confirmed by recent reports from Turkey, a
primarily Muslim country, indicating a strikingly high prevalence for
the disorder. However, most available research, although limited in
scope, does not support this notion (Lahaie *et al.* 2010).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

By definition, the diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder
is only given to women. There is relatively new research concerning
urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men, suggesting that men may
experience some similar problems. The research and clinical experience
are not sufficiently developed yet to justify the application of this
diagnosis to men. Other specified sexual dysfunction or unspecified
sexual dysfunction may be diagnosed in men appearing to fit this
pattern.

Functional Consequences of

Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder

Functional difficulties in genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder are
often associated with interference in relationship satisfaction and
sometimes with the ability to conceive via penile/vaginal intercourse.

[]{#index_split_033.html#p485}**440**

Sexual Dysfunctions

Differential Diagnosis

Another medical condition.

In many instances, women with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder
will also be diagnosed with another medical condition (e.g., lichen
scle-rosus, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, vulvovaginal
atrophy). In some cases, treating the medical condition may alleviate
the genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.

Much of the time, this is not the case. There are no reliable tools or
diagnostic methods to allow clinicians to know whether the medical
condition or genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is primary. Often,
the associated medical conditions are difficult to diagnose and treat.
For example, the increased incidence of postmenopausal pain during
intercourse may sometimes be attributable to vaginal dryness or
vulvovaginal atrophy associated with declining estrogen levels. The
relationship, however, between vulvovaginal atrophy/dryness, estrogen,
and pain is not well understood.

Somatic symptom and related disorders.

Some women with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder may also be
diagnosable with somatic symptom disorder. Since both genito-pelvic
pain/penetration disorder and the somatic symptom and related disorders
are new diagnoses, it is not yet clear whether they can be reliably
differentiated. Some women diagnosed with genito-pelvic pain/penetration
disorder will also be diagnosed with a specific phobia.

Inadequate sexual stimuli.

It is important that the clinician, in considering differential
diagnoses, assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the woman's
sexual experience. Sexual situations in which there is inadequate
foreplay or arousal may lead to difficulties in penetration, pain, or
avoidance. Erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation in the male
partner may result in difficulties with penetration. These conditions
should be carefully assessed. In some situations, a diagnosis of
genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder may not be appropriate.

Comorbidity

Comorbidity between genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and other
sexual difficulties appears to be common. Comorbidity with relationship
distress is also common. This is not surprising, since in Western
cultures the inability to have (pain-free) intercourse with a desired
partner and the avoidance of sexual opportunities may be either a
contributing factor to or the result of other sexual or relationship
problems. Because pelvic floor symptoms are implicated in the diagnosis
of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, there is likely to be a
higher prevalence of other disorders related to the pelvic floor or
reproductive organs (e.g., interstitial cystitis, constipation, vaginal
infection, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome).

Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.71 (F52.0)**

A. Persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual/erotic
thoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity. The judgment of
deficiency is made by the clinician, taking into account factors that
affect sexual functioning, such as age and general and sociocultural
contexts of the individual's life.

B. The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of
approximately 6 months.

C. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in
the individual.

D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental
disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress or other
significant stressors and is not attributable to thes effects of a
substance/medication or another medical condition.

[]{#index_split_033.html#p486}Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder
**441**

*Specify* whether:

**Lifelong:** The disturbance has been present since the individual
became sexually active.

**Acquired:** The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal
sexual function.

*Specify* whether:

**Generalized:** Not limited to certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners.

**Situational:** Only occurs with certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

**Moderate:** Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

**Severe:** Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features

When an assessment for male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is being
made, interpersonal context must be taken into account. A "desire
discrepancy," in which a man has lower desire for sexual activity than
his partner, is not sufficient to diagnose male hypoactive sexual desire
disorder. Both low/absent desire for sex and deficient/absent sexual
thoughts or fantasies are required for a diagnosis of the disorder.
There may be variation across men in how sexual desire is expressed.

The lack of desire for sex and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or
fantasies must be persistent or recurrent and must occur for a minimum
duration of approximately 6 months.

The inclusion of this duration criterion is meant to safeguard against
making a diagnosis in cases in which a man's low sexual desire may
represent an adaptive response to adverse life conditions (e.g., concern
about a partner's pregnancy when the man is considering terminating the
relationship). The introduction of "approximately" in Criterion B allows
for clinician judgment in cases in which symptom duration does not meet
the recommended 6-month threshold.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is sometimes associated with
erectile and/or ejaculatory concerns. For example, persistent
difficulties obtaining an erection may lead a man to lose interest in
sexual activity. Men with hypoactive sexual desire disorder often report
that they no longer initiate sexual activity and that they are minimally
receptive to a partner's attempt to initiate. Sexual activities (e.g.,
masturbation or partnered sexual activity) may sometimes occur even in
the presence of low sexual desire. Relationship-specific preferences
regarding patterns of sexual initiation must be taken into account when
making a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Although
men are more likely to initiate sexual activity, and thus low desire may
be characterized by a pattern of non-initiation, many men may prefer to
have their partner initiate sexual activity. In such situations, the
man's lack of receptivity to a partner's initiation should be considered
when evaluating low desire.

In addition to the subtypes "lifelong/acquired" and
"generalized/situational," the following five factors must be considered
during assessment and diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire
disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or
treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems,
partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor
communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3)
individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of
sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,
anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4)
cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions
against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical
factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treat-

[]{#index_split_033.html#p487}**442**

Sexual Dysfunctions

ment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting
symptoms of different men with this disorder.

Prevalence

The prevalence of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder varies
depending on country of origin and method of assessment. Approximately
6% of younger men (ages 18--24 years) and 41% of older men (ages 66--74
years) have problems with sexual desire. However, a persistent lack of
interest in sex, lasting 6 months or more, affects only a small
proportion of men ages 16--44 (1.8%).

Development and Course

By definition, lifelong male hypoactive sexual desire disorder indicates
that low or no sexual desire has always been present, whereas the
acquired subtype would be assigned if the man's low desire developed
after a period of normal sexual desire. There is a requirement that low
desire persist for approximately 6 months or more; thus, short-term
changes in sexual desire should not be diagnosed as male hypoactive
sexual desire disorder.

There is a normative age-related decline in sexual desire. Like women,
men identify a variety of triggers for their sexual desire, and they
describe a wide range of reasons that they choose to engage in sexual
activity. Although erotic visual cues may be more potent elicitors of
desire in younger men, the potency of sexual cues may decrease with age
and must be considered when evaluating men for hypoactive sexual desire
disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Mood and anxiety symptoms appear to be strong predictors of low desire
in men. Up to half of men with a past history of psychiatric symptoms
may have moderate or severe loss of desire, compared with only 15% of
those without such a history. A man's feelings about himself, his
perception of his partner's sexual desire toward him, feelings of being
emotionally connected, and contextual variables may all negatively (as
well as positively) affect sexual desire.

Environmental.

Alcohol use may increase the occurrence of low desire. Among gay men,
self-directed homophobia, interpersonal problems, attitudes, lack of
adequate sex education, and trauma resulting from early life experiences
must be taken into account in explaining the low desire. Social and
cultural contextual factors should also be considered.

Genetic and physiological.

Endocrine disorders such as hyperprolactinemia significantly affect
sexual desire in men. Age is a significant risk factor for low desire in
men. It is unclear whether or not men with low desire also have
abnormally low levels of testosterone; however, among hypogonadal men,
low desire is common. There also may be a critical threshold below which
testosterone will affect sexual desire in men and above which there is
little effect of testosterone on men's desire.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

There is marked variability in prevalence rates of low desire across
cultures, ranging from 12.5% in Northern European men to 28% in
Southeast Asian men ages 40--80 years. Just as there are higher rates of
low desire among East Asian subgroups of women, men of East Asian
ancestry also have higher rates of low desire. Guilt about sex may
mediate this association between East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire
in men.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

In contrast to the classification of sexual disorders in women, desire
and arousal disorders have been retained as separate constructs in men.
Despite some similarities in the experi-

[]{#index_split_033.html#p488}Premature (Early) Ejaculation

**443**

ence of desire across men and women, and the fact that desire fluctuates
over time and is dependent on contextual factors, men do report a
significantly higher intensity and frequency of sexual desire compared
with women.

Differential Diagnosis

Nonsexual mental disorders.

Nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive

disorder, which is characterized by "markedly diminished interest or
pleasure in all, or almost all, activities," may explain the lack of
sexual desire. If the lack of desire is better explained by another
mental disorder, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire
disorder would not be made.

Substance/medication use.

Substance/medication use may explain the lack of sexual desire.

Another medical condition.

If the low/absent desire and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or
fantasies are better explained by the effects of another medical
condition (e.g., hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction,
central nervous system disease), then a diagnosis of male hypoactive
sexual desire disorder would not be made.

Interpersonal factors.

If interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe
relationship distress or other significant stressors, are associated
with the loss of desire in the man, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive
sexual desire disorder would not be made.

Other sexual dysfunctions.

The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis
of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder; there is some evidence that
up to one-half of men with low sexual desire also have erectile
difficulties, and slightly fewer may also have early ejaculation
difficulties. If the man's low desire is explained by
self-identification as an asexual, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive
sexual desire disorder is not made.

Comorbidity

Depression and other mental disorders, as well as endocrinological
factors, are often comorbid with male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

Premature (Early) Ejaculation

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.75 (F52.4)**

A. A persistent or recurrent pattern of ejaculation occurring during
partnered sexual activity within approximately 1 minute following
vaginal penetration and before the individual wishes it.

**Note:** Although the diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation may be
applied to individuals engaged in nonvaginal sexual activities, specific
duration criteria have not been established for these activities.

B. The symptom in Criterion A must have been present for at least 6
months and must be experienced on almost all or all (approximately
75%--100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified situational
contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts).

C. The symptom in Criterion A causes clinically significant distress in
the individual.

D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental
disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress or other
significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects of a
substance/medication or another medical condition.

*Specify* whether:

**Lifelong:** The disturbance has been present since the individual
became sexually active.

**Acquired:** The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal
sexual function.

[]{#index_split_033.html#p489}**444**

Sexual Dysfunctions

*Specify* whether:

**Generalized:** Not limited to certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners.

**Situational:** Only occurs with certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Ejaculation occurring within approximately 30 seconds to 1
minute of vaginal penetration.

**Moderate:** Ejaculation occurring within approximately 15--30 seconds
of vaginal penetration.

**Severe:** Ejaculation occurring prior to sexual activity, at the start
of sexual activity, or within approximately 15 seconds of vaginal
penetration.

Diagnostic Features

Premature (early) ejaculation is manifested by ejaculation that occurs
prior to or shortly after vaginal penetration, operationalized by an
individual's estimate of ejaculatory latency (i.e., elapsed time before
ejaculation) after vaginal penetration. Estimated and measured
intravaginal ejaculatory latencies are highly correlated as long as the
ejaculatory latency is of short duration; therefore, self-reported
estimates of ejaculatory latency are sufficient for diagnostic purposes.
A 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency time is an appropriate
cutoff for the diagnosis of lifelong premature (early) ejaculation in
heterosexual men.

There are insufficient data to determine if this duration criterion can
be applied to acquired premature (early) ejaculation. The durational
definition may apply to males of varying sexual orientations, since
ejaculatory latencies appear to be similar across men of different
sexual orientations and across different sexual activities.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Many males with premature (early) ejaculation complain of a sense of
lack of control over ejaculation and report apprehension about their
anticipated inability to delay ejaculation on future sexual encounters.

The following factors may be relevant in the evaluation of any sexual
dysfunction: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems,
partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor
communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3)
individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of
sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,
anxiety), and stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/

religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against
sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors
relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment.

Prevalence

Estimates of the prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation vary widely
depending on the definition utilized. Internationally, more than
20%--30% of men ages 18--70 years report concern about how rapidly they
ejaculate. With the new definition of premature (early) ejaculation
(i.e., ejaculation occurring within approximately 1 minute of vaginal
penetration), only 1%--3% of men would be diagnosed with the disorder.
Prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation may increase with age.

Development and Course

By definition, lifelong premature (early) ejaculation starts during a
male's initial sexual experiences and persists thereafter. Some men may
experience premature (early) ejaculation during their initial sexual
encounters but gain ejaculatory control over time. It is the persistence
of ejaculatory problems for longer than 6 months that determines the
diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation. In contrast, some men
develop the disorder after a period of
[]{#index_split_033.html#p490}Premature (Early) Ejaculation

**445**

having a normal ejaculatory latency, known as *acquired premature
(early) ejaculation.* There is far less known about acquired premature
(early) ejaculation than about lifelong premature (early) ejaculation.
The acquired form likely has a later onset, usually appearing during or
after the fourth decade of life. Lifelong is relatively stable
throughout life. Little is known about the course of acquired premature
(early) ejaculation. Reversal of medical conditions such as
hyperthyroidism and prostatitis appears to restore ejaculatory latencies
to baseline values.

Lifelong premature (early) ejaculation begins with early sexual
experiences and persists throughout an individual's life. In
approximately 20% of men with premature (early) ejaculation, ejaculatory
latencies decrease further with age. Age and relationship length have
been found to be negatively associated with prevalence of premature
(early) ejaculation.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Premature (early) ejaculation may be more common in men with anxiety
disorders, especially social anxiety disorder (social phobia).

Genetic and physiological.

There is a moderate genetic contribution to lifelong premature (early)
ejaculation. Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with
dopamine transporter gene polymorphism or serotonin transporter gene
polymorphism. Thyroid disease, prostatitis, and drug withdrawal are
associated with acquired premature (early) ejaculation. Positron
emission tomography measures of regional cerebral blood flow during
ejaculation have shown primary activation in the mesocephalic transition
zone, including the ventral tegmental area.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Perception of what constitutes a normal ejaculatory latency is different
in many cultures.

Measured ejaculatory latencies may differ in some countries. Such
differences may be explained by cultural or religious factors as well as
genetic differences between populations.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Premature (early) ejaculation is a sexual disorder in males. Males and
their sexual partners may differ in their perception of what constitutes
an acceptable ejaculatory latency. There may be increasing concerns in
females about early ejaculation in their sexual partners, which may be a
reflection of changing societal attitudes concerning female sexual
activity.

Diagnostic Markers

Ejaculatory latency is usually monitored in research settings by the
sexual partner utilizing a timing device (e.g., stopwatch), though this
is not ideal in real-life sexual situations. For vaginal intercourse,
the time between intravaginal penetration and ejaculation is measured.

Functional Consequences of

Premature (Early) Ejaculation

A pattern of premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with
decreased self-esteem, a sense of lack of control, and adverse
consequences for partner relationships. It may also cause personal
distress in the sexual partner and decreased sexual satisfaction in the
sexual partner. Ejaculation prior to penetration may be associated with
difficulties in conception.

Differential Diagnosis

Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.

When problems with premature

ejaculation are due exclusively to substance use, intoxication, or
withdrawal, substance/

medication-induced sexual dysfunction should be diagnosed.

[]{#index_split_033.html#p491}**446**

Sexual Dysfunctions

Ejaculatory concerns that do not meet diagnostic criteria.

It is necessary to identify

males with normal ejaculatory latencies who desire longer ejaculatory
latencies and males who have episodic premature (early) ejaculation
(e.g., during the first sexual encounter with a new partner when a short
ejaculatory latency may be common or normative). Neither of these
situations would lead to a diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation,
even though these situations may be distressing to some males.

Comorbidity

Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with erectile problems.
In many cases, it may be difficult to determine which difficulty
preceded the other. Lifelong premature (early) ejaculation may be
associated with certain anxiety disorders. Acquired premature (early)
ejaculation may be associated with prostatitis, thyroid disease, or drug
withdrawal (e.g., during opioid withdrawal).

Substance/Medication-Induced

Sexual Dysfunction

Diagnostic Criteria

A. A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is
predominant in the clinical picture.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):

1\. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance
intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.

2\. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the
symptoms in Criterion A.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction that
is not substance/

medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction
could include the following:

The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month)
after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there
is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent
nonsubstance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., a history of
recurrent nonsubstance/medication-related episodes).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the
individual.

**Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of
substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in
Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently
severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-induced sexual dysfunctions are indicated in the
table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM

code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use
disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance
use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction,
the 4th position character is "1," and the clinician should record

"mild \[substance\] use disorder" before the substance-induced sexual
dysfunction (e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced
sexual dysfunction"). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is
comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position
character is "2," and the clinician should record "moderate
\[substance\] use disorder"

or "severe \[substance\] use disorder," depending on the severity of the
comorbid substance

[]{#index_split_033.html#p492}Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual
Dysfunction **447**

use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g.,
after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position
character is "9," and the clinician should record only the
substance-induced sexual dysfunction.

**With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for
intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during
intoxication.

**With onset during withdrawal:** If criteria are met for withdrawal
from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after,
withdrawal.

**With onset after medication use:** Symptoms may appear either at
initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Occurs on 25%--50% of occasions of sexual activity.

**Severe:** Occurs on 75% or more of occasions of sexual activity.

Recording Procedures

ICD-9-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction begins
with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol, fluoxetine) that is presumed
to be causing the sexual dysfunction. The diagnostic code is selected
from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
fluoxetine), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases
in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used.

The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset
after medication use), followed by the severity specifier (e.g., mild,
moderate, severe). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which
combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a
single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the
substance use disorder.

For example, in the case of erectile dysfunction occurring during
intoxication in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis
is 291.89 alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during
intoxication, moderate. An additional diagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol
use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to
play a sig-

Sexual Dysfunctions

nificant role in the development of the sexual dysfunction, each should
be listed separately (e.g., 292.89 cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction
with onset during intoxication, moderate; 292.89 fluoxetine-induced
sexual dysfunction, with onset after medication use).

ICD-10-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction begins
with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol, fluoxetine) that is presumed
to be causing the sexual dysfunction. The diagnostic code is selected
from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For
substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., fluoxetine),
the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases in which a
substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class
of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance" should be
used.

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, followed by the
specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during
withdrawal, with onset after medication use), followed by the severity
specifier (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). For example, in the case of
erectile dysfunction occurring during intoxication in a man with a
severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.281 moderate alcohol
use disorder with alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during
intoxication, moderate. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe
alcohol use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced sexual
dysfunction occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g.,
after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance
use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.981 amphetamine-induced sexual
dysfunction, with onset during intoxication). When more than one
substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the
sexual dysfunction, each should be listed separately (e.g., F14.181 mild
cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset
during intoxication, moderate; F19.981 fluoxetine-induced sexual
dysfunction, with onset after medication use, moderate).

Diagnostic Features

The major feature is a disturbance in sexual function that has a
temporal relationship with substance/medication initiation, dose
increase, or substance/medication discontinuation.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Sexual dysfunctions can occur in association with intoxication with the
following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics,
or anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown)
substances. Sexual dysfunctions can occur in association with withdrawal
from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics; and other (or unknown) substances.
Medications that can induce sexual dysfunctions include antidepressants,
antipsychotics, and hormonal contraceptives.

The most commonly reported side effect of antidepressant drugs is
difficulty with orgasm or ejaculation. Problems with desire and erection
are less frequent. Approximately 30% of sexual complaints are clinically
significant. Certain agents, such as bupropion and mirtazapine, appear
not to be associated with sexual side effects.

The sexual problems associated with antipsychotic drugs, including
problems with sexual desire, erection, lubrication, ejaculation, or
orgasm, have occurred with typical as well as atypical agents. However,
problems are less common with prolactin-sparing antipsychotics than with
agents that cause significant prolactin elevation.

Although the effects of mood stabilizers on sexual function are unclear,
it is possible that lithium and anticonvulsants, with the possible
exception of lamotrigine, have adverse effects on sexual desire.
Problems with orgasm may occur with gabapentin. Similarly, there may be
a higher prevalence of erectile and orgasmic problems associated with
benzodiazepines. There have not been such reports with buspirone.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p494}Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual
Dysfunction **449**

Many nonpsychiatric medications, such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic,
gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents, are associated with disturbances
in sexual function. Illicit substance use is associated with decreased
sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty reaching orgasm.
Sexual dysfunctions are also seen in individuals receiving methadone but
are seldom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chronic alcohol
abuse and chronic nicotine abuse are associated with erectile problems.

Prevalence

The prevalence and the incidence of substance/medication-induced sexual
dysfunction are unclear, likely because of underreporting of
treatment-emergent sexual side effects.

Data on substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction typically
concern the effects of antidepressant drugs. The prevalence of
antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction varies in part depending on
the specific agent. Approximately 25%--80% of individuals taking
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonergic
antidepressants, and combined serotonergic-adrenergic antidepressants
report sexual side effects. There are differences in the incidence of
sexual side effects between some serotonergic and combined
adrenergic-serotonergic antidepressants, although it is unclear if these
differences are clinically significant.

Approximately 50% of individuals taking antipsychotic medications will
experience adverse sexual side effects, including problems with sexual
desire, erection, lubrication, ejaculation, or orgasm. The incidence of
these side effects among different antipsychotic agents is unclear.

Exact prevalence and incidence of sexual dysfunctions among users of
nonpsychiatric medications such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic,
gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents are unknown. Elevated rates of
sexual dysfunction have been reported with methadone or high-dose opioid
drugs for pain. There are increased rates of decreased sexual desire,
erectile dysfunction, and difficulty reaching orgasm associated with
illicit substance use. The prevalence of sexual problems appears related
to chronic drug abuse and appears higher in individuals who abuse heroin
(approximately 60%--70%) than in individuals who abuse amphetamines or
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (i.e., MDMA, ecstasy). Elevated rates
of sexual dysfunction are also seen in individuals receiving methadone
but are seldom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chronic
alcohol abuse and chronic nicotine abuse are related to higher rates of
erectile problems.

Development and Course

The onset of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction may be as early
as 8 days after the agent is first taken. Approximately 30% of
individuals with mild to moderate orgasm delay will experience
spontaneous remission of the dysfunction within 6 months. In some cases,
serotonin reuptake inhibitor--induced sexual dysfunction may persist
after the agent is discontinued. The time to onset of sexual dysfunction
after initiation of antipsychotic drugs or drugs of abuse is unknown. It
is probable that the adverse effects of nicotine and alcohol may not
appear until after years of use. Premature (early) ejaculation can
sometimes occur after cessation of opioid use. There is some evidence
that disturbances in sexual function related to substance/medication use
increase with age.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

There may be an interaction among cultural factors, the influence of
medications on sexual functioning, and the response of the individual to
those changes.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Some gender differences in sexual side effects may exist.

Sexual Dysfunctions

Functional Consequences of

Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction

Medication-induced sexual dysfunction may result in medication
noncompliance.

Differential Diagnosis

Nonsubstance/medication-induced sexual dysfunctions.

Many mental conditions, such

as depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, are associated
with disturbances of sexual function. Thus, differentiating a
substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction from a manifestation of
the underlying mental disorder can be quite difficult. The diagnosis is
usually established if a close relationship between substance/medication
initiation or discontinuation is observed. A clear diagnosis can be
established if the problem occurs after substance/medication initiation,
dissipates with substance/medication discontinuation, and recurs with
introduction of the same agent. Most substance/medication-induced side
effects occur shortly after initiation or discontinuation. Sexual side
effects that only occur after chronic use of a substance/medication may
be extremely difficult to diagnose with certainty.

Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction

**302.79 (F52.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a sexual dysfunction that cause clinically significant distress in
the individual predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class.

The other specified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in
which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific sexual
dysfunction. This is done by recording "other specified sexual
dysfunction" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "sexual aversion").

Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction

**302.70 (F52.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a sexual dysfunction that cause clinically significant distress in
the individual predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class.

The unspecified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in
which the clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason that the
criteria are not met for a specific sexual dysfunction, and includes
presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p496} **Gender**

**Dysphoria**

In this chapter, there is one overarching diagnosis of gender dysphoria,
with separate developmentally appropriate criteria sets for children and
for adolescents and adults.

The area of sex and gender is highly controversial and has led to a
proliferation of terms whose meanings vary over time and within and
between disciplines. An additional source of confusion is that in
English "sex" connotes both male/female and sexuality. This chapter
employs constructs and terms as they are widely used by clinicians from
various disciplines with specialization in this area. In this chapter,
*sex* and *sexual* refer to the biological indicators of male and female
(understood in the context of reproductive capacity), such as in sex
chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal and
external genitalia. Disorders of sex development denote conditions of
inborn somatic deviations of the reproductive tract from the norm and/or
discrepancies among the biological indicators of male and female.
*Cross-sex* hormone treatment denotes the use of feminizing hormones in
an individual assigned male at birth based on traditional biological
indicators or the use of masculinizing hormones in an individual
assigned female at birth.

The need to introduce the term *gender* arose with the realization that
for individuals with conflicting or ambiguous biological indicators of
sex (i.e., "intersex"), the lived role in society and/or the
identification as male or female could not be uniformly associated with
or predicted from the biological indicators and, later, that some
individuals develop an identity as female or male at variance with their
uniform set of classical biological indicators. Thus, *gender* is used
to denote the public (and usually legally recognized) lived role as boy
or girl, man or woman, but, in contrast to certain social
constructionist theories, biological factors are seen as contributing,
in interaction with social and psychological factors, to gender
development. *Gender assignment* refers to the initial assignment as
male or female.

This occurs usually at birth and, thereby, yields the "natal gender."
*Gender-atypical* refers to somatic features or behaviors that are not
typical (in a statistical sense) of individuals with the same assigned
gender in a given society and historical era; for behavior,
*gender-nonconforming* is an alternative descriptive term. *Gender
reassignment* denotes an official (and usually legal) change of gender.
*Gender identity* is a category of social identity and refers to an
individual's identification as male, female, or, occasionally, some
category other than male or female. *Gender dysphoria* as a general
descriptive term refers to an individual's affective/

cognitive discontent with the assigned gender but is more specifically
defined when used as a diagnostic category. *Transgender* refers to the
broad spectrum of individuals who transiently or persistently identify
with a gender different from their natal gender. *Transsexual* denotes
an individual who seeks, or has undergone, a social transition from male
to female or female to male, which in many, but not all, cases also
involves a somatic transition by cross-sex hormone treatment and genital
surgery ( *sex reassignment surgery*).

*Gender dysphoria* refers to the distress that may accompany the
incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and one's
assigned gender. Although not all individuals will experience distress
as a result of such incongruence, many are distressed if the desired
physical interventions by means of hormones and/or surgery are not
available.

The current term is more descriptive than the previous DSM-IV term
*gender identity disorder* and focuses on dysphoria as the clinical
problem, not identity per se.

gender (e.g., penectomy, vaginoplasty in a natal male; mastectomy or
phalloplasty in a natal female).

Specifiers

The posttransition specifier may be used in the context of continuing
treatment procedures that serve to support the new gender assignment.

Diagnostic Features

Individuals with gender dysphoria have a marked incongruence between the
gender they have been assigned to (usually at birth, referred to as
*natal gender*) and their experienced/

expressed gender. This discrepancy is the core component of the
diagnosis. There must also be evidence of distress about this
incongruence. Experienced gender may include alternative gender
identities beyond binary stereotypes. Consequently, the distress is not
limited to a desire to simply be of the other gender, but may include a
desire to be of an alternative gender, provided that it differs from the
individual's assigned gender.

Gender dysphoria manifests itself differently in different age groups.
Prepubertal natal girls with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be
a boy, assert they are a boy, or assert they will grow up to be a man.
They prefer boys' clothing and hairstyles, are often perceived by
strangers as boys, and may ask to be called by a boy's name. Usually,
they display intense negative reactions to parental attempts to have
them wear dresses or other feminine attire. Some may refuse to attend
school or social events where such clothes are required. These girls may
demonstrate marked cross-gender identification in role-playing, dreams,
and fantasies. Contact sports, rough-and-tumble play, traditional
boyhood games, and boys as playmates are most often preferred. They show
little interest in stereotypically feminine toys (e.g., dolls) or
activities (e.g., feminine dress-up or role-play). Occasionally, they
refuse to urinate in a sitting position. Some natal girls may express a
desire to have a penis or claim to have a penis or that they will grow
one when older. They may also state that they do not want to develop
breasts or menstruate.

Prepubertal natal boys with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be
a girl or assert they are a girl or that they will grow up to be a
woman. They have a preference for dressing in girls' or women's clothes
or may improvise clothing from available materials (e.g., using towels,
aprons, and scarves for long hair or skirts). These children may
role-play female figures (e.g., playing "mother") and often are
intensely interested in female fantasy figures. Traditional feminine
activities, stereotypical games, and pastimes (e.g., "playing house";
drawing feminine pictures; watching television or videos of favorite
female characters) are most often preferred. Stereotypical female-type
dolls (e.g., Barbie) are often favorite toys, and girls are their
preferred playmates. They avoid rough-and-tumble play and competitive
sports and have little interest in stereotypically masculine toys (e.g.,
cars, trucks). Some may pretend not to have a penis and insist on
sitting to urinate. More []{#index_split_034.html#p499}**454**

Gender Dysphoria

rarely, they may state that they find their penis or testes disgusting,
that they wish them removed, or that they have, or wish to have, a
vagina.

In young adolescents with gender dysphoria, clinical features may
resemble those of children or adults with the condition, depending on
developmental level. As secondary sex characteristics of young
adolescents are not yet fully developed, these individuals may not state
dislike of them, but they are concerned about imminent physical changes.

In adults with gender dysphoria, the discrepancy between experienced
gender and physical sex characteristics is often, but not always,
accompanied by a desire to be rid of primary and/or secondary sex
characteristics and/or a strong desire to acquire some primary and/or
secondary sex characteristics of the other gender. To varying degrees,
adults with gender dysphoria may adopt the behavior, clothing, and
mannerisms of the experienced gender. They feel uncomfortable being
regarded by others, or functioning in society, as members of their
assigned gender. Some adults may have a strong desire to be of a
different gender and treated as such, and they may have an inner
certainty to feel and respond as the experienced gender without seeking
medical treatment to alter body characteristics. They may find other
ways to resolve the incongruence between experienced/

expressed and assigned gender by partially living in the desired role or
by adopting a gender role neither conventionally male nor conventionally
female.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

When visible signs of puberty develop, natal boys may shave their legs
at the first signs of hair growth. They sometimes bind their genitals to
make erections less visible. Girls may bind their breasts, walk with a
stoop, or use loose sweaters to make breasts less visible. Increasingly,
adolescents request, or may obtain without medical prescription and
supervision, hormonal suppressors ("blockers") of gonadal steroids
(e.g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone \[GnRH\] analog, spironolactone).
Clinically referred adolescents often want hormone treatment and many
also wish for gender reassignment surgery. Adolescents living in an
accepting environment may openly express the desire to be and be treated
as the experienced gender and dress partly or completely as the
experienced gender, have a hairstyle typical of the experienced gender,
preferentially seek friendships with peers of the other gender, and/or
adopt a new first name consistent with the experienced gender. Older
adolescents, when sexually active, usually do not show or allow partners
to touch their sexual organs. For adults with an aversion toward their
genitals, sexual activity is constrained by the preference that their
genitals not be seen or touched by their partners. Some adults may seek
hormone treatment (sometimes without medical prescription and
supervision) and gender reassignment surgery. Others are satisfied with
either hormone treatment or surgery alone.

Adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria before gender reassignment
are at increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and
suicides. After gender reassignment, adjustment may vary, and suicide
risk may persist.

Prevalence

For natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005% to 0.014%, and for
natal females, from 0.002% to 0.003%. Since not all adults seeking
hormone treatment and surgical reassignment attend specialty clinics,
these rates are likely modest underestimates. Sex differences in rate of
referrals to specialty clinics vary by age group. In children, sex
ratios of natal boys to girls range from 2:1 to 4.5:1. In adolescents,
the sex ratio is close to parity; in adults, the sex ratio favors natal
males, with ratios ranging from 1:1 to 6.1:1. In two countries, the sex
ratio appears to favor natal females (Japan: 2.2:1; Poland: 3.4:1).

Development and Course

Because expression of gender dysphoria varies with age, there are
separate criteria sets for children versus adolescents and adults.
Criteria for children are defined in a more con-

crete, behavioral manner than those for adolescents and adults. Many of
the core criteria draw on well-documented behavioral gender differences
between typically developing boys and girls. Young children are less
likely than older children, adolescents, and adults to express extreme
and persistent anatomic dysphoria. In adolescents and adults,
incongruence between experienced gender and somatic sex is a central
feature of the diagnosis.

Factors related to distress and impairment also vary with age. A very
young child may show signs of distress (e.g., intense crying) only when
parents tell the child that he or she is "really" not a member of the
other gender but only "desires" to be. Distress may not be manifest in
social environments supportive of the child's desire to live in the role
of the other gender and may emerge only if the desire is interfered
with. In adolescents and adults, distress may manifest because of strong
incongruence between experienced gender and somatic sex. Such distress
may, however, be mitigated by supportive environments and knowledge that
biomedical treatments exist to reduce incongruence. Impairment (e.g.,
school refusal, development of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse)
may be a consequence of gender dysphoria.

Gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development.

For clinic-referred children,

onset of cross-gender behaviors is usually between ages 2 and 4 years.
This corresponds to the developmental time period in which most
typically developing children begin expressing gendered behaviors and
interests. For some preschool-age children, both pervasive cross-gender
behaviors and the expressed desire to be the other gender may be
present, or, more rarely, labeling oneself as a member of the other
gender may occur. In some cases, the expressed desire to be the other
gender appears later, usually at entry into elementary school. A small
minority of children express discomfort with their sexual anatomy or
will state the desire to have a sexual anatomy corresponding to the
experienced gender ("anatomic dysphoria"). Expressions of anatomic
dysphoria become more common as children with gender dysphoria approach
and anticipate puberty.

Rates of persistence of gender dysphoria from childhood into adolescence
or adulthood vary. In natal males, persistence has ranged from 2.2% to
30%. In natal females, persistence has ranged from 12% to 50%.
Persistence of gender dysphoria is modestly correlated with dimensional
measures of severity ascertained at the time of a childhood baseline
assessment. In one sample of natal males, lower socioeconomic background
was also modestly correlated with persistence. It is unclear if
particular therapeutic approaches to gender dysphoria in children are
related to rates of long-term persistence. Extant follow-up samples
consisted of children receiving no formal therapeutic intervention or
receiving therapeutic interventions of various types, ranging from
active efforts to reduce gender dysphoria to a more neutral, "watchful
waiting" approach. It is unclear if children "encouraged" or supported
to live socially in the desired gender will show higher rates of
persistence, since such children have not yet been followed
longitudinally in a systematic manner. For both natal male and female
children showing persistence, almost all are sexually attracted to
individuals of their natal sex. For natal male children whose gender
dysphoria does not persist, the majority are *androphilic* (sexually
attracted to males) and often self-identify as gay or homosexual
(ranging from 63% to 100%). In natal female children whose gender
dysphoria does not persist, the percentage who are *gynephilic*
(sexually attracted to females) and self-identify as lesbian is lower
(ranging from 32% to 50%).

In both adolescent and adult natal males, there are two broad
trajectories for development of gender dysphoria: early onset and late
onset. *Early-onset gender dysphoria* starts in childhood and continues
into adolescence and adulthood; or, there is an intermittent period in
which the gender dysphoria desists and these individuals self-identify
as gay or homosexual, followed by recurrence of gender dysphoria.
*Late-onset gender dysphoria* occurs around puberty or much later in
life. Some of these individuals report having had a desire to be of the
other gender in childhood that was not expressed verbally to others.
Others do not recall any signs of childhood gender dysphoria. For
adolescent males with late-onset gender dysphoria, parents often report
surprise because they did not see signs of gender
[]{#index_split_034.html#p501}**456**

Gender Dysphoria

dysphoria during childhood. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are more
common and salient in adolescents and adults once secondary sex
characteristics have developed.

Adolescent and adult natal males with early-onset gender dysphoria are
almost always sexually attracted to men (androphilic). Adolescents and
adults with late-onset gender dysphoria frequently engage in transvestic
behavior with sexual excitement. The majority of these individuals are
gynephilic or sexually attracted to other posttransition natal males
with late-onset gender dysphoria. A substantial percentage of adult
males with late-onset gender dysphoria cohabit with or are married to
natal females. After gender transition, many self-identify as lesbian.
Among adult natal males with gender dysphoria, the early-onset group
seeks out clinical care for hormone treatment and reassignment surgery
at an earlier age than does the late-onset group. The late-onset group
may have more fluctuations in the degree of gender dysphoria and be more
ambivalent about and less likely satisfied after gender reassignment
surgery.

In both adolescent and adult natal females, the most common course is
the early-onset form of gender dysphoria. The late-onset form is much
less common in natal females compared with natal males. As in natal
males with gender dysphoria, there may have been a period in which the
gender dysphoria desisted and these individuals self-identified as
lesbian; however, with recurrence of gender dysphoria, clinical
consultation is sought, often with the desire for hormone treatment and
reassignment surgery. Parents of natal adolescent females with the
late-onset form also report surprise, as no signs of childhood gender
dysphoria were evident. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are much more
common and salient in adolescents and adults than in children.

Adolescent and adult natal females with early-onset gender dysphoria are
almost always gynephilic. Adolescents and adults with the late-onset
form of gender dysphoria are usually androphilic and after gender
transition self-identify as gay men. Natal females with the late-onset
form do not have co-occurring transvestic behavior with sexual
excitement.

Gender dysphoria in association with a disorder of sex development.

Most individuals

with a disorder of sex development who develop gender dysphoria have
already come to medical attention at an early age. For many, starting at
birth, issues of gender assignment were raised by physicians and
parents. Moreover, as infertility is quite common for this group,
physicians are more willing to perform cross-sex hormone treatments and
genital surgery before adulthood.

Disorders of sex development in general are frequently associated with
gender-atypical behavior starting in early childhood. However, in the
majority of cases, this does not lead to gender dysphoria. As
individuals with a disorder of sex development become aware of their
medical history and condition, many experience uncertainty about their
gender, as opposed to developing a firm conviction that they are another
gender. However, most do not progress to gender transition. Gender
dysphoria and gender transition may vary considerably as a function of a
disorder of sex development, its severity, and assigned gender.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

For individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex
development, atypical gender behavior among individuals with early-onset
gender dysphoria develops in early preschool age, and it is possible
that a high degree of atypicality makes the development of gender
dysphoria and its persistence into adolescence and adulthood more
likely.

Environmental.

Among individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex
development, males with gender dysphoria (in both childhood and
adolescence) more commonly have older brothers than do males without the
condition. Additional predisposing

[]{#index_split_034.html#p502}Gender Dysphoria

**457**

factors under consideration, especially in individuals with late-onset
gender dysphoria (adolescence, adulthood), include habitual fetishistic
transvestism developing into autogynephilia (i.e., sexual arousal
associated with the thought or image of oneself as a woman) and other
forms of more general social, psychological, or developmental problems.

Genetic and physiological.

For individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex
development, some genetic contribution is suggested by evidence for
(weak) familial-ity of transsexualism among nontwin siblings, increased
concordance for transsexualism in monozygotic compared with dizygotic
same-sex twins, and some degree of heritability of gender dysphoria. As
to endocrine findings, no endogenous systemic abnormalities in
sex-hormone levels have been found in 46,XY individuals, whereas there
appear to be increased androgen levels (in the range found in hirsute
women but far below normal male levels) in 46,XX individuals. Overall,
current evidence is insufficient to label gender dysphoria without a
disorder of sex development as a form of intersexuality limited to the
central nervous system.

In gender dysphoria associated with a disorder of sex development, the
likelihood of later gender dysphoria is increased if prenatal production
and utilization (via receptor sensitivity) of androgens are grossly
atypical relative to what is usually seen in individuals with the same
assigned gender. Examples include 46,XY individuals with a history of
normal male prenatal hormone milieu but inborn nonhormonal genital
defects (as in cloacal bladder exstrophy or penile agenesis) and who
have been assigned to the female gender.

The likelihood of gender dysphoria is further enhanced by additional,
prolonged, highly gender-atypical postnatal androgen exposure with
somatic virilization as may occur in female-raised and noncastrated
46,XY individuals with 5-alpha reductase-2 deficiency or
17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3 deficiency or in female-raised
46,XX individuals with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia with
prolonged periods of nonadherence to glucocorticoid replacement therapy.
However, the prenatal androgen milieu is more closely related to
gendered behavior than to gender identity. Many individuals with
disorders of sex development and markedly gender-atypical behavior do
not develop gender dysphoria. Thus, gender-atypical behavior by itself
should not be interpreted as an indicator of current or future gender
dysphoria. There appears to be a higher rate of gender dysphoria and
patient-initiated gender change from assigned female to male than from
assigned male to female in 46,XY individuals with a disorder of sex
development.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Individuals with gender dysphoria have been reported across many
countries and cultures. The equivalent of gender dysphoria has also been
reported in individuals living in cultures with institutionalized gender
categories other than male or female. It is unclear whether with these
individuals the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria would be met.

Diagnostic Markers

Individuals with a somatic disorder of sex development show some
correlation of final gender identity outcome with the degree of prenatal
androgen production and utilization.

However, the correlation is not robust enough for the biological factor,
where ascertain-able, to replace a detailed and comprehensive diagnostic
interview evaluation for gender dysphoria.

Functional Consequences of Gender Dysphoria

Preoccupation with cross-gender wishes may develop at all ages after the
first 2--3 years of childhood and often interfere with daily activities.
In older children, failure to develop age-typical same-sex peer
relationships and skills may lead to isolation from peer groups and to
distress. Some children may refuse to attend school because of teasing
and harass-

Gender Dysphoria

ment or pressure to dress in attire associated with their assigned sex.
Also in adolescents and adults, preoccupation with cross-gender wishes
often interferes with daily activities.

Relationship difficulties, including sexual relationship problems, are
common, and functioning at school or at work may be impaired. Gender
dysphoria, along with atypical gender expression, is associated with
high levels of stigmatization, discrimination, and victimization,
leading to negative self-concept, increased rates of mental disorder
comorbidity, school dropout, and economic marginalization, including
unemployment, with attendant social and mental health risks, especially
in individuals from resource-poor family backgrounds. In addition, these
individuals' access to health services and mental health services may be
impeded by structural barriers, such as institutional discomfort or
inex-perience in working with this patient population.

Differential Diagnosis

Nonconformity to gender roles.

Gender dysphoria should be distinguished from simple nonconformity to
stereotypical gender role behavior by the strong desire to be of another
gender than the assigned one and by the extent and pervasiveness of
gender-variant activities and interests. The diagnosis is not meant to
merely describe nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior
(e.g., "tomboyism" in girls, "girly-boy" behavior in boys, occasional
cross-dressing in adult men). Given the increased openness of atypical
gender expressions by individuals across the entire range of the
transgender spectrum, it is important that the clinical diagnosis be
limited to those individuals whose distress and impairment meet the
specified criteria.

Transvestic disorder.

Transvestic disorder occurs in heterosexual (or bisexual) adolescent and
adult males (rarely in females) for whom cross-dressing behavior
generates sexual excitement and causes distress and/or impairment
without drawing their primary gender into question. It is occasionally
accompanied by gender dysphoria. An individual with transvestic disorder
who also has clinically significant gender dysphoria can be given both
diagnoses. In many cases of late-onset gender dysphoria in gynephilic
natal males, transvestic behavior with sexual excitement is a precursor.

Body dysmorphic disorder.

An individual with body dysmorphic disorder focuses on the alteration or
removal of a specific body part because it is perceived as abnormally
formed, not because it represents a repudiated assigned gender. When an
individual's presentation meets criteria for both gender dysphoria and
body dysmorphic disorder, both diagnoses can be given. Individuals
wishing to have a healthy limb amputated (termed by some *body integrity
identity disorder*) because it makes them feel more "complete" usually
do not wish to change gender, but rather desire to live as an amputee or
a disabled person.

Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

In schizophrenia, there may rarely be

delusions of belonging to some other gender. In the absence of psychotic
symptoms, insistence by an individual with gender dysphoria that he or
she is of some other gender is not considered a delusion. Schizophrenia
(or other psychotic disorders) and gender dysphoria may co-occur.

Other clinical presentations.

Some individuals with an emasculinization desire who

develop an alternative, nonmale/nonfemale gender identity do have a
presentation that meets criteria for gender dysphoria. However, some
males seek castration and/or penectomy for aesthetic reasons or to
remove psychological effects of androgens without changing male
identity; in these cases, the criteria for gender dysphoria are not met.

Comorbidity

Clinically referred children with gender dysphoria show elevated levels
of emotional and behavioral problems---most commonly, anxiety,
disruptive and impulse-control, and de-

[]{#index_split_034.html#p504}Other Specified Gender Dysphoria

**459**

pressive disorders. In prepubertal children, increasing age is
associated with having more behavioral or emotional problems; this is
related to the increasing non-acceptance of gender-variant behavior by
others. In older children, gender-variant behavior often leads to peer
ostracism, which may lead to more behavioral problems. The prevalence of
mental health problems differs among cultures; these differences may
also be related to differences in attitudes toward gender variance in
children. However, also in some non-Western cultures, anxiety has been
found to be relatively common in individuals with gender dysphoria, even
in cultures with accepting attitudes toward gender-variant behavior.
Autism spectrum disorder is more prevalent in clinically referred
children with gender dysphoria than in the general population.
Clinically referred adolescents with gender dysphoria appear to have
comorbid mental disorders, with anxiety and depressive disorders being
the most common. As in children, autism spectrum disorder is more
prevalent in clinically referred adolescents with gender dysphoria than
in the general population. Clinically referred adults with gender
dysphoria may have coexisting mental health problems, most commonly
anxiety and depressive disorders.

Other Specified Gender Dysphoria

**302.6 (F64.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender
dysphoria. The other specified gender dysphoria category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for gender
dysphoria. This is done by recording "other specified gender dysphoria"
followed by the specific reason (e.g., "brief gender dysphoria").

An example of a presentation that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation is the following:

**The current disturbance meets symptom criteria for gender dysphoria,
but the** **duration is less than 6 months.**

Unspecified Gender Dysphoria

**302.6 (F64.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender
dysphoria. The unspecified gender dysphoria category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason
that the criteria are not met for gender dysphoria, and includes
presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p505} *This page intentionally left blank*

[]{#index_split_034.html#p506}**Disruptive, Impulse-Control,**

**and Conduct Disorders**

Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders include conditions
involving problems in the self-control of emotions and behaviors. While
other disorders in DSM5 may also involve problems in emotional and/or
behavioral regulation, the disorders in this chapter are unique in that
these problems are manifested in behaviors that violate the rights of
others (e.g., aggression, destruction of property) and/or that bring the
individual into significant conflict with societal norms or authority
figures. The underlying causes of the problems in the self-control of
emotions and behaviors can vary greatly across the disorders in this
chapter and among individuals within a given diagnostic category.

The chapter includes oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent
explosive disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder
(which is described in the chapter "Personality Disorders"), pyromania,
kleptomania, and other specified and unspecified disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders. Although all the disorders in
the chapter involve problems in both emotional and behavioral
regulation, the source of variation among the disorders is the relative
emphasis on problems in the two types of self-control. For example, the
criteria for conduct disorder focus largely on poorly controlled
behaviors that violate the rights of others or that violate major
societal norms. Many of the behavioral symptoms (e.g., aggression) can
be a result of poorly controlled emotions such as anger. At the other
extreme, the criteria for intermittent explosive disorder focus largely
on such poorly controlled emotion, outbursts of anger that are
disproportionate to the interpersonal or other provocation or to other
psychosocial stressors. Intermediate in impact to these two disorders is
oppositional defiant disorder, in which the criteria are more evenly
distributed between emotions (anger and irritation) and behaviors
(argumentativeness and defiance). Pyromania and kleptomania are less
commonly used diagnoses characterized by poor impulse control related to
specific behaviors (fire setting or stealing) that relieve internal
tension. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct
disorder is a category for conditions in which there are symptoms of
conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or other disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders, but the number of symptoms does
not meet the diagnostic threshold for any of the disorders in this
chapter, even though there is evidence of clinically significant
impairment associated with the symptoms.

The disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders all tend to be
more common in males than in females, although the relative degree of
male predominance may differ both across disorders and within a disorder
at different ages. The disorders in this chapter tend to have first
onset in childhood or adolescence. In fact, it is very rare for either
conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder to first emerge in
adulthood. There is a developmental relationship between oppositional
defiant disorder and conduct disorder, in that most cases of conduct
disorder previously would have met criteria for oppositional defiant
disorder, at least in those cases in which conduct disorder emerges
prior to adolescence. However, most children with oppositional defiant
disorder do not eventually develop conduct disorder. Furthermore,
children with oppositional defiant disorder are at risk for eventually
developing other problems besides conduct disorder, including anxiety
and depressive disorders.

Many of the symptoms that define the disruptive, impulse-control, and
conduct disorders are behaviors that can occur to some degree in
typically developing individuals.

Thus, it is critical that the frequency, persistence, pervasiveness
across situations, and im-461

[]{#index_split_034.html#p507}**462**

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

pairment associated with the behaviors indicative of the diagnosis be
considered relative to what is normative for a person's age, gender, and
culture when determining if they are symptomatic of a disorder.

The disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders have been linked
to a common externalizing spectrum associated with the personality
dimensions labeled as *disinhibition* and (inversely) *constraint* and,
to a lesser extent, negative emotionality. These shared personality
dimensions could account for the high level of comorbidity among these
disorders and their frequent comorbidity with substance use disorders
and antisocial personality disorder. However, the specific nature of the
shared diathesis that constitutes the externalizing spectrum remains
unknown.

Oppositional Defiant Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**313.81 (F91.3)**

A. A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or
vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months as evidenced by at least four
symptoms from any of the following categories, and exhibited during
interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling.

**Angry/Irritable Mood**

1\. Often loses temper.

2\. Is often touchy or easily annoyed.

3\. Is often angry and resentful.

**Argumentative/Defiant Behavior**

4\. Often argues with authority figures or, for children and
adolescents, with adults.

5\. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from
authority figures or with rules.

6\. Often deliberately annoys others.

7\. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.

**Vindictiveness**

8\. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6
months.

**Note:** The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should be
used to distinguish a behavior that is within normal limits from a
behavior that is symptomatic. For children younger than 5 years, the
behavior should occur on most days for a period of at least 6 months
unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals 5 years or older,
the behavior should occur at least once per week for at least 6 months,
unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). While these frequency criteria
provide guidance on a minimal level of frequency to define symptoms,
other factors should also be considered, such as whether the frequency
and intensity of the behaviors are outside a range that is normative for
the individual's developmental level, gender, and culture.

B. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the
individual or others in his or her immediate social context (e.g.,
family, peer group, work colleagues), or it impacts negatively on
social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

C. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a
psychotic, substance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the
criteria are not met for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Symptoms are confined to only one setting (e.g., at home, at
school, at work, with peers).

[]{#index_split_034.html#p508}Oppositional Defiant Disorder

**463**

**Moderate:** Some symptoms are present in at least two settings.

**Severe:** Some symptoms are present in three or more settings.

Specifiers

It is not uncommon for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to
show symptoms only at home and only with family members. However, the
pervasiveness of the symptoms is an indicator of the severity of the
disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of oppositional defiant disorder is a frequent and
persistent pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant
behavior, or vindictiveness (Criterion A). It is not unusual for
individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show the behavioral
features of the disorder without problems of negative mood. However,
individuals with the disorder who show the angry/irritable mood symptoms
typically show the behavioral features as well.

The symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder may be confined to only
one setting, and this is most frequently the home. Individuals who show
enough symptoms to meet the diagnostic threshold, even if it is only at
home, may be significantly impaired in their social functioning.
However, in more severe cases, the symptoms of the disorder are present
in multiple settings. Given that the pervasiveness of symptoms is an
indicator of the severity of the disorder, it is critical that the
individual's behavior be assessed across multiple settings and
relationships. Because these behaviors are common among siblings, they
must be observed during interactions with persons other than siblings.
Also, because symptoms of the disorder are typically more evident in
interactions with adults or peers whom the individual knows well, they
may not be apparent during a clinical examination.

The symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder can occur to some degree
in individuals without this disorder. There are several key
considerations for determining if the behaviors are symptomatic of
oppositional defiant disorder. First, the diagnostic threshold of four
or more symptoms within the preceding 6 months must be met. Second, the
persistence and frequency of the symptoms should exceed what is
normative for an individual's age, gender, and culture. For example, it
is not unusual for preschool children to show temper tantrums on a
weekly basis. Temper outbursts for a preschool child would be considered
a symptom of oppositional defiant disorder only if they occurred on most
days for the preceding 6 months, if they occurred with at least three
other symptoms of the disorder, and if the temper outbursts contributed
to the significant impairment associated with the disorder (e.g., led to
destruction of property during outbursts, resulted in the child being
asked to leave a preschool).

The symptoms of the disorder often are part of a pattern of problematic
interactions with others. Furthermore, individuals with this disorder
typically do not regard themselves as angry, oppositional, or defiant.
Instead, they often justify their behavior as a response to unreasonable
demands or circumstances. Thus, it can be difficult to disentangle the
relative contribution of the individual with the disorder to the
problematic interactions he or she experiences. For example, children
with oppositional defiant disorder may have experienced a history of
hostile parenting, and it is often impossible to determine if the
child's behavior caused the parents to act in a more hostile manner
toward the child, if the parents' hostility led to the child's
problematic behavior, or if there was some combination of both. Whether
or not the clinician can separate the relative contributions of
potential causal factors should not influence whether or not the
diagnosis is made. In the event that the child may be living in
particularly poor conditions where neglect or mistreatment may occur
(e.g., in institutional settings), clinical attention to reducing the
contribution of the environment may be helpful.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p509}**464**

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

In children and adolescents, oppositional defiant disorder is more
prevalent in families in which child care is disrupted by a succession
of different caregivers or in families in which harsh, inconsistent, or
neglectful child-rearing practices are common. Two of the most common
co-occurring conditions with oppositional defiant disorder are
attention-deficit/

hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (see the section
"Comorbidity" for this disorder). Oppositional defiant disorder has been
associated with increased risk for suicide attempts, even after comorbid
disorders are controlled for.

Prevalence

The prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder ranges from 1% to 11%,
with an average prevalence estimate of around 3.3%. The rate of
oppositional defiant disorder may vary depending on the age and gender
of the child. The disorder appears to be somewhat more prevalent in
males than in females (1.4:1) prior to adolescence. This male
predominance is not consistently found in samples of adolescents or
adults.

Development and Course

The first symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder usually appear
during the preschool years and rarely later than early adolescence.
Oppositional defiant disorder often precedes the development of conduct
disorder, especially for those with the childhood-onset type of conduct
disorder. However, many children and adolescents with oppositional
defiant disorder do not subsequently develop conduct disorder.
Oppositional defiant disorder also conveys risk for the development of
anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, even in the absence of
conduct disorder. The defiant, argumentative, and vindictive symptoms
carry most of the risk for conduct disorder, whereas the angry-irritable
mood symptoms carry most of the risk for emotional disorders.

Manifestations of the disorder across development appear consistent.
Children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder are at
increased risk for a number of problems in adjustment as adults,
including antisocial behavior, impulse-control problems, substance
abuse, anxiety, and depression.

Many of the behaviors associated with oppositional defiant disorder
increase in frequency during the preschool period and in adolescence.
Thus, it is especially critical during these development periods that
the frequency and intensity of these behaviors be evaluated against
normative levels before it is decided that they are symptoms of
oppositional defiant disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Features

Temperamental.

Temperamental factors related to problems in emotional regulation (e.g.,
high levels of emotional reactivity, poor frustration tolerance) have
been predictive of the disorder.

Environmental.

Harsh, inconsistent, or neglectful child-rearing practices are common in
families of children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder,
and these parenting practices play an important role in many causal
theories of the disorder.

Genetic and physiological.

A number of neurobiological markers (e.g., lower heart rate and skin
conductance reactivity; reduced basal cortisol reactivity; abnormalities
in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala) have been associated with
oppositional defiant disorder.

However, the vast majority of studies have not separated children with
oppositional defiant disorder from those with conduct disorder. Thus, it
is unclear whether there are markers specific to oppositional defiant
disorder.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p510}Oppositional Defiant Disorder

**465**

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The prevalence of the disorder in children and adolescents is relatively
consistent across countries that differ in race and ethnicity.

Functional Consequences of

Oppositional Defiant Disorder

When oppositional defiant disorder is persistent throughout development,
individuals with the disorder experience frequent conflicts with
parents, teachers, supervisors, peers, and romantic partners. Such
problems often result in significant impairments in the individual's
emotional, social, academic, and occupational adjustment.

Differential Diagnosis

Conduct disorder.

Conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are both related to
conduct problems that bring the individual in conflict with adults and
other authority figures (e.g., teachers, work supervisors). The
behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder are typically of a less
severe nature than those of conduct disorder and do not include
aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, or a
pattern of theft or deceit.

Furthermore, oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of
emotional dysregulation (i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not
included in the definition of conduct disorder.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

ADHD is often comorbid with oppositional defiant disorder. To make the
additional diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder, it is important
to determine that the individual's failure to conform to requests of
others is not solely in situations that demand sustained effort and
attention or demand that the individual sit still.

Depressive and bipolar disorders.

Depressive and bipolar disorders often involve negative affect and
irritability. As a result, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder
should not be made if the symptoms occur exclusively during the course
of a mood disorder.

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Oppositional defiant disorder shares with disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder the symptoms of chronic negative mood and temper outbursts.
However, the severity, frequency, and chronicity of temper outbursts are
more severe in individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
than in those with oppositional defiant disorder. Thus, only a minority
of children and adolescents whose symptoms meet criteria for
oppositional defiant disorder would also be diagnosed with disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder. When the mood disturbance is severe enough
to meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a diagnosis
of oppositional defiant disorder is not given, even if all criteria for
oppositional defiant disorder are met.

Intermittent explosive disorder.

Intermittent explosive disorder also involves high

rates of anger. However, individuals with this disorder show serious
aggression toward others that is not part of the definition of
oppositional defiant disorder.

Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).

In individuals with intellectual disability, a diagnosis of oppositional
defiant disorder is given only if the oppositional behavior is markedly
greater than is commonly observed among individuals of comparable mental
age and with comparable severity of intellectual disability.

Language disorder.

Oppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from a failure
to follow directions that is the result of impaired language
comprehension (e.g., hearing loss).

Social anxiety disorder (social phobia).

Oppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from defiance
due to fear of negative evaluation associated with social anxiety
disorder.

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

Comorbidity

Rates of oppositional defiant disorder are much higher in samples of
children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD, and this may be the result
of shared temperamental risk factors. Also, oppositional defiant
disorder often precedes conduct disorder, although this appears to be
most common in children with the childhood-onset subtype. Individuals
with oppositional defiant disorder are also at increased risk for
anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, and this seems largely
attributable to the presence of the angry-irritable mood symptoms.
Adolescents and adults with oppositional defiant disorder also show a
higher rate of substance use disorders, although it is unclear if this
association is independent of the comorbidity with conduct disorder.

Intermittent Explosive Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**312.34 (F63.81)**

A. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control
aggressive impulses as manifested by either of the following:

1\. Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments
or fights) or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other
individuals, occurring twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3
months. The physical aggression does not result in damage or destruction
of property and does not result in physical injury to animals or other
individuals.

2\. Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of
property and/or physical assault involving physical injury against
animals or other individuals occurring within a 12-month period.

B. The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent
outbursts is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any
precipitating psychosocial stressors.

C. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they
are impulsive and/

or anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective
(e.g., money, power, intimidation).

D. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in
the individual or impairment in occupational or interpersonal
functioning, or are associated with financial or legal consequences.

E. Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmental
level).

F. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by
another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar
disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a psychotic disorder,
antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder) and
are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma,
Alzheimer's disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance
(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication). For children ages 6--18 years,
aggressive behavior that occurs as part of an adjustment disorder should
not be considered for this diagnosis.

**Note:** This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional
defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder when recurrent impulsive
aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen in these
disorders and warrant independent clinical attention.

Diagnostic Features

The impulsive (or anger-based) aggressive outbursts in intermittent
explosive disorder have a rapid onset and, typically, little or no
prodromal period. Outbursts typically last for less

[]{#index_split_034.html#p512}Intermittent Explosive Disorder

**467**

than 30 minutes and commonly occur in response to a minor provocation by
a close intimate or associate. Individuals with intermittent explosive
disorder often have less severe episodes of verbal and/or nondamaging,
nondestructive, or noninjurious physical assault (Criterion A1) in
between more severe destructive/assaultive episodes (Criterion A2).
Criterion A1 defines frequent (i.e., twice weekly, on average, for a
period of 3 months) aggressive outbursts characterized by temper
tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights, or assault without damage
to objects or without injury to animals or other individuals. Criterion
A2

defines infrequent (i.e., three in a 1-year period) impulsive aggressive
outbursts characterized by damaging or destroying an object, regardless
of its tangible value, or by assaulting/

striking or otherwise causing physical injury to an animal or to another
individual. Regardless of the nature of the impulsive aggressive
outburst, the core feature of intermittent explosive disorder is failure
to control impulsive aggressive behavior in response to subjectively
experienced provocation (i.e., psychosocial stressor) that would not
typically result in an aggressive outburst (Criterion B). The aggressive
outbursts are generally impulsive and/

or anger-based, rather than premeditated or instrumental (Criterion C)
and are associated with significant distress or impairment in
psychosocial function (Criterion D). A diagnosis of intermittent
explosive disorder should not be given to individuals younger than 6
years, or the equivalent developmental level (Criterion E), or to
individuals whose aggressive outbursts are better explained by another
mental disorder (Criterion F). A diagnosis of intermittent explosive
disorder should not be given to individuals with disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder or to individuals whose impulsive aggressive
outbursts are attributable to another medical condition or to the
physiological effects of a substance (Criterion F).

In addition, children ages 6--18 years should not receive this diagnosis
when impulsive aggressive outbursts occur in the context of an
adjustment disorder (Criterion F).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Mood disorders (unipolar), anxiety disorders, and substance use
disorders are associated with intermittent explosive disorder, although
onset of these disorders is typically later than that of intermittent
explosive disorder.

Prevalence

One-year prevalence data for intermittent explosive disorder in the
United States is about 2.7% (narrow definition). Intermittent explosive
disorder is more prevalent among younger individuals (e.g., younger than
35--40 years), compared with older individuals (older than 50 years),
and in individuals with a high school education or less.

Development and Course

The onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behavior is
most common in late childhood or adolescence and rarely begins for the
first time after age 40 years. The core features of intermittent
explosive disorder, typically, are persistent and continue for many
years.

The course of the disorder may be episodic, with recurrent periods of
impulsive aggressive outbursts. Intermittent explosive disorder appears
to follow a chronic and persistent course over many years. It also
appears to be quite common regardless of the presence or absence of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders (e.g., conduct disorder,
oppositional defiant disorder).

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Individuals with a history of physical and emotional trauma during the
first two decades of life are at increased risk for intermittent
explosive disorder.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p513}**468**

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

Genetic and physiological.

First-degree relatives of individuals with intermittent explosive
disorder are at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder, and
twin studies have demonstrated a substantial genetic influence for
impulsive aggression.

Research provides neurobiological support for the presence of
serotonergic abnormalities, globally and in the brain, specifically in
areas of the limbic system (anterior cingulate) and orbitofrontal cortex
in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder. Amygdala responses
to anger stimuli, during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning,
are greater in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder compared
with healthy individuals.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The lower prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder in some regions
(Asia, Middle East) or countries (Romania, Nigeria), compared with the
United States, suggests that information about recurrent, problematic,
impulsive aggressive behaviors either is not elicited on questioning or
is less likely to be present, because of cultural factors.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

In some studies the prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder is
greater in males than in females (odds ratio = 1.4--2.3); other studies
have found no gender difference.

Functional Consequences of

Intermittent Explosive Disorder

Social (e.g., loss of friends, relatives, marital instability),
occupational (e.g., demotion, loss of employment), financial (e.g., due
to value of objects destroyed), and legal (e.g., civil suits as a result
of aggressive behavior against person or property; criminal charges for
assault) problems often develop as a result of intermittent explosive
disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when
Criteria A1 and/

or A2 are only met during an episode of another mental disorder (e.g.,
major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder), or
when impulsive aggressive outbursts are attributable to another medical
condition or to the physiological effects of a substance or medication.
This diagnosis also should not be made, particularly in children and
adolescents ages 6--18 years, when the impulsive aggressive outbursts
occur in the context of an adjustment disorder. Other examples in which
recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts may, or may not,
be diagnosed as intermittent explosive disorder include the following.

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

In contrast to intermittent explosive disorder,

disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by a
persistently negative mood state (i.e., irritability, anger) most of the
day, nearly every day, between impulsive aggressive outbursts. A
diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder can only be given
when the onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts
is before age 10 years. Finally, a diagnosis of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder should not be made for the first time after age
18 years. Otherwise, these diagnoses are mutually exclusive.

Antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder.

Individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline
personality disorder often display recurrent, problematic impulsive
aggressive outbursts. However, the level of impulsive aggression in
individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline
personality disorder is lower than that in individuals with intermittent
explosive disorder.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p514}Conduct Disorder

**469**

Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, and personality change due to
another medical condition, aggressive type.

A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when
aggressive outbursts are judged to result from the physiological effects
of another diagnosable medical condition (e.g., brain injury associated
with a change in personality characterized by aggressive outbursts;
complex partial epilepsy). Nonspecific abnormalities on neurological
examination (e.g., "soft signs") and nonspecific electroencephalographic
changes are compatible with a diagnosis of intermittent explosive
disorder unless there is a diagnosable medical condition that better
explains the impulsive aggressive outbursts.

Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal.

A diagnosis of intermittent explosive

disorder should not be made when impulsive aggressive outbursts are
nearly always associated with intoxication with or withdrawal from
substances (e.g., alcohol, phencyclidine, cocaine and other stimulants,
barbiturates, inhalants). However, when a sufficient number of impulsive
aggressive outbursts also occur in the absence of substance intoxication
or withdrawal, and these warrant independent clinical attention, a
diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional
defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.

Individuals with any of these childhood-onset disorders may exhibit
impulsive aggressive outbursts. Individuals with ADHD are typically
impulsive and, as a result, may also exhibit impulsive aggressive
outbursts. While individuals with conduct disorder can exhibit impulsive
aggressive outbursts, the form of aggression characterized by the
diagnostic criteria is proactive and predatory. Aggression in
oppositional defiant disorder is typically characterized by temper
tantrums and verbal arguments with authority figures, whereas impulsive
aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder are in response
to a broader array of provocation and include physical assault. The
level of impulsive aggression in individuals with a history of one or
more of these disorders has been reported as lower than that in
comparable individuals whose symptoms also meet intermittent explosive
disorder Criteria A through E. Accordingly, if Criteria A through E are
also met, and the impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent
clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may
be given.

Comorbidity

Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are
most commonly comorbid with intermittent explosive disorder. In
addition, individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline
personality disorder, and individuals with a history of disorders with
disruptive behaviors (e.g., ADHD, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant
disorder), are at greater risk for comorbid intermittent explosive
disorder.

Conduct Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

A. A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic
rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are
violated, as manifested by the presence of at least three of the
following 15 criteria in the past 12 months from any of the categories
below, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months:
**Aggression to People and Animals**

1\. Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others.

2\. Often initiates physical fights.

3\. Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others
(e.g., a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun).

[]{#index_split_034.html#p515}**470**

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

4\. Has been physically cruel to people.

5\. Has been physically cruel to animals.

6\. Has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse
snatching, extortion, armed robbery).

7\. Has forced someone into sexual activity.

**Destruction of Property**

8\. Has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of
causing serious damage.

9\. Has deliberately destroyed others' property (other than by fire
setting).

**Deceitfulness or Theft**

10\. Has broken into someone else's house, building, or car.

11\. Often lies to obtain goods or favors or to avoid obligations (i.e.,
"cons" others).

12\. Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim
(e.g., shoplifting, but without breaking and entering; forgery).

**Serious Violations of Rules**

13\. Often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions, beginning
before age 13 years.

14\. Has run away from home overnight at least twice while living in the
parental or parental surrogate home, or once without returning for a
lengthy period.

15\. Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13 years.

B. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment
in social, academic, or occupational functioning.

C. If the individual is age 18 years or older, criteria are not met for
antisocial personality disorder.

*Specify* whether:

**312.81 (F91.1) Childhood-onset type:** Individuals show at least one
symptom characteristic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years.

**312.82 (F91.2) Adolescent-onset type:** Individuals show no symptom
characteristic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years.

**312.89 (F91.9) Unspecified onset:** Criteria for a diagnosis of
conduct disorder are met, but there is not enough information available
to determine whether the onset of the first symptom was before or after
age 10 years.

*Specify* if:

**With limited prosocial emotions:** To qualify for this specifier, an
individual must have displayed at least two of the following
characteristics persistently over at least 12 months and in multiple
relationships and settings. These characteristics reflect the
individual's typical pattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning
over this period and not just occasional occurrences in some situations.
Thus, to assess the criteria for the specifier, multiple information
sources are necessary. In addition to the individual's self-report, it
is necessary to consider reports by others who have known the individual
for extended periods of time (e.g., parents, teachers, coworkers,
extended family members, peers).

**Lack of remorse or guilt:** Does not feel bad or guilty when he or she
does something wrong (exclude remorse when expressed only when caught
and/or facing punishment). The individual shows a general lack of
concern about the negative consequences of his or her actions. For
example, the individual is not remorseful after hurting someone or does
not care about the consequences of breaking rules.

**Callous---lack of empathy:** Disregards and is unconcerned about the
feelings of others. The individual is described as cold and uncaring.
The person appears more concerned about the effects of his or her
actions on himself or herself, rather than their effects on others, even
when they result in substantial harm to others.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p516}Conduct Disorder

**471**

**Unconcerned about performance:** Does not show concern about
poor/problematic performance at school, at work, or in other important
activities. The individual does not put forth the effort necessary to
perform well, even when expectations are clear, and typically blames
others for his or her poor performance.

**Shallow or deficient affect:** Does not express feelings or show
emotions to others, except in ways that seem shallow, insincere, or
superficial (e.g., actions contradict the emotion displayed; can turn
emotions "on" or "off" quickly) or when emotional expressions are used
for gain (e.g., emotions displayed to manipulate or intimidate others).

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Few if any conduct problems in excess of those required to
make the diagnosis are present, and conduct problems cause relatively
minor harm to others (e.g., lying, truancy, staying out after dark
without permission, other rule breaking).

**Moderate:** The number of conduct problems and the effect on others
are intermediate between those specified in "mild" and those in "severe"
(e.g., stealing without confronting a victim, vandalism).

**Severe:** Many conduct problems in excess of those required to make
the diagnosis are present, or conduct problems cause considerable harm
to others (e.g., forced sex, physical cruelty, use of a weapon, stealing
while confronting a victim, breaking and entering).

Subtypes

Three subtypes of conduct disorder are provided based on the age at
onset of the disorder.

Onset is most accurately estimated with information from both the youth
and the caregiver; estimates are often 2 years later than actual onset.
Both subtypes can occur in a mild, moderate, or severe form. An
unspecified-onset subtype is designated when there is insufficient
information to determine age at onset.

In childhood-onset conduct disorder, individuals are usually male,
frequently display physical aggression toward others, have disturbed
peer relationships, may have had oppositional defiant disorder during
early childhood, and usually have symptoms that meet full criteria for
conduct disorder prior to puberty. Many children with this subtype also
have concurrent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other
neurodevelopmental difficulties. Individuals with childhood-onset type
are more likely to have persistent conduct disorder into adulthood than
are those with adolescent-onset type. As compared with individuals with
childhood-onset type, individuals with adolescent-onset conduct disorder
are less likely to display aggressive behaviors and tend to have more
normative peer relationships (although they often display conduct
problems in the company of others). These individuals are less likely to
have conduct disorder that persists into adulthood. The ratio of males
to females with conduct disorder is more balanced for the
adolescent-onset type than for the childhood-onset type.

Specifiers

A minority of individuals with conduct disorder exhibit characteristics
that qualify for the

"with limited prosocial emotions" specifier. The indicators of this
specifier are those that have often been labeled as callous and
unemotional traits in research. Other personality features, such as
thrill seeking, fearlessness, and insensitivity to punishment, may also
distinguish those with characteristics described in the specifier.
Individuals with characteristics described in this specifier may be more
likely than other individuals with conduct disorder to engage in
aggression that is planned for instrumental gain. Individuals with
conduct disorder of any subtype or any level of severity can have
characteristics that qualify for the specifier "with limited prosocial
emotions," although individuals with the specifier are more likely to
have childhood-onset type and a severity specifier rating of severe.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p517}**472**

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

Although the validity of self-report to assess the presence of the
specifier has been supported in some research contexts, individuals with
conduct disorder with this specifier may not readily admit to the traits
in a clinical interview. Thus, to assess the criteria for the specifier,
multiple information sources are necessary. Also, because the indicators
of the specifier are characteristics that reflect the individual's
typical pattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning, it is
important to consider reports by others who have known the individual
for extended periods of time and across relationships and settings
(e.g., parents, teachers, coworkers, extended family members, peers).

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of conduct disorder is a repetitive and persistent
pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major
age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated (Criterion A).
These behaviors fall into four main groupings: aggressive conduct that
causes or threatens physical harm to other people or animals (Criteria
A1--A7); non-aggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage
(Criteria A8--A9); deceitfulness or theft (Criteria A10--A12); and
serious violations of rules (Criteria A13--A15). Three or more
characteristic behaviors must have been present during the past 12
months, with at least one behavior present in the past 6 months. The
disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in
social, academic, or occupational functioning (Criterion B). The
behavior pattern is usually present in a variety of settings, such as
home, at school, or in the community. Because individuals with conduct
disorder are likely to minimize their conduct problems, the clinician
often must rely on additional informants. However, informants' knowledge
of the individual's conduct problems may be limited if they have
inadequately supervised the individual or the individual has concealed
symptom behaviors.

Individuals with conduct disorder often initiate aggressive behavior and
react aggressively to others. They may display bullying, threatening, or
intimidating behavior (including bullying via messaging on Web-based
social media) (Criterion A1); initiate frequent physical fights
(Criterion A2); use a weapon that can cause serious physical harm (e.g.,
a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun) (Criterion A3); be physically
cruel to people (Criterion A4) or animals (Criterion A5); steal while
confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching, extortion, armed
robbery) (Criterion A6); or force someone into sexual activity
(Criterion A7).

Physical violence may take the form of rape, assault, or, in rare cases,
homicide. Deliberate destruction of others' property may include
deliberate fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage
(Criterion A8) or deliberate destroying of other people's property in
other ways (e.g., smashing car windows, vandalizing school property)
(Criterion A9). Acts of deceitfulness or theft may include breaking into
someone else's house, building, or car (Criterion A10); frequently lying
or breaking promises to obtain goods or favors or to avoid debts or
obligations (e.g., "conning" other individuals) (Criterion A11); or
stealing items of nontrivial value without confronting the victim (e.g.,
shoplifting, forgery, fraud) (Criterion A12).

Individuals with conduct disorder may also frequently commit serious
violations of rules (e.g., school, parental, workplace). Children with
conduct disorder often have a pattern, beginning before age 13 years, of
staying out late at night despite parental prohibitions (Criterion A13).
Children may also show a pattern of running away from home overnight
(Criterion A14). To be considered a symptom of conduct disorder, the
running away must have occurred at least twice (or only once if the
individual did not return for a lengthy period). Runaway episodes that
occur as a direct consequence of physical or sexual abuse do not
typically qualify for this criterion. Children with conduct disorder may
often be truant from school, beginning prior to age 13 years (Criterion
A15).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Especially in ambiguous situations, aggressive individuals with conduct
disorder frequently misperceive the intentions of others as more hostile
and threatening than is the

[]{#index_split_034.html#p518}Conduct Disorder

**473**

case and respond with aggression that they then feel is reasonable and
justified. Personality features of trait negative emotionality and poor
self-control, including poor frustration tolerance, irritability, temper
outbursts, suspiciousness, insensitivity to punishment, thrill seeking,
and recklessness, frequently co-occur with conduct disorder. Substance
misuse is often an associated feature, particularly in adolescent
females. Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicide
occur at a higher-than-expected rate in individuals with conduct
disorder.

Prevalence

One-year population prevalence estimates range from 2% to more than 10%,
with a median of 4%. The prevalence of conduct disorder appears to be
fairly consistent across various countries that differ in race and
ethnicity. Prevalence rates rise from childhood to adolescence and are
higher among males than among females. Few children with impairing
conduct disorder receive treatment.

Development and Course

The onset of conduct disorder may occur as early as the preschool years,
but the first significant symptoms usually emerge during the period from
middle childhood through middle adolescence. Oppositional defiant
disorder is a common precursor to the childhood-onset type of conduct
disorder. Conduct disorder may be diagnosed in adults, however, symptoms
of conduct disorder usually emerge in childhood or adolescence, and
onset is rare after age 16 years. The course of conduct disorder after
onset is variable. In a majority of individuals, the disorder remits by
adulthood. Many individuals with conduct disorder---particularly those
with adolescent-onset type and those with few and milder
symptoms---achieve adequate social and occupational adjustment as
adults. However, the early-onset type predicts a worse prognosis and an
increased risk of criminal behavior, conduct disorder, and
substance-related disorders in adulthood. Individuals with conduct
disorder are at risk for later mood disorders, anxiety disorders,
posttraumatic stress disorder, impulse-control disorders, psychotic
disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and substance-related disorders as
adults.

Symptoms of the disorder vary with age as the individual develops
increased physical strength, cognitive abilities, and sexual maturity.
Symptom behaviors that emerge first tend to be less serious (e.g.,
lying, shoplifting), whereas conduct problems that emerge last tend to
be more severe (e.g., rape, theft while confronting a victim). However,
there are wide differences among individuals, with some engaging in the
more damaging behaviors at an early age (which is predictive of a worse
prognosis). When individuals with conduct disorder reach adulthood,
symptoms of aggression, property destruction, deceitfulness, and rule
violation, including violence against coworkers, partners, and children,
may be exhibited in the workplace and the home, such that antisocial
personality disorder may be considered.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Temperamental risk factors include a difficult undercontrolled infant
temperament and lower-than-average intelligence, particularly with
regard to verbal IQ.

Environmental.

Family-level risk factors include parental rejection and neglect,
inconsistent child-rearing practices, harsh discipline, physical or
sexual abuse, lack of supervision, early institutional living, frequent
changes of caregivers, large family size, parental criminality, and
certain kinds of familial psychopathology (e.g., substance-related
disorders). Community-level risk factors include peer rejection,
association with a delinquent peer group, and neighborhood exposure to
violence. Both types of risk factors tend to be more common and severe
among individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of conduct disorder.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p519}**474**

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

Genetic and physiological.

Conduct disorder is influenced by both genetic and environmental
factors. The risk is increased in children with a biological or adoptive
parent or a sibling with conduct disorder. The disorder also appears to
be more common in children of biological parents with severe alcohol use
disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, or schizophrenia or
biological parents who have a history of ADHD or conduct disorder.

Family history particularly characterizes individuals with the
childhood-onset subtype of conduct disorder. Slower resting heart rate
has been reliably noted in individuals with conduct disorder compared
with those without the disorder, and this marker is not characteristic
of any other mental disorder. Reduced autonomic fear conditioning,
particularly low skin conductance, is also well documented. However,
these psychophysiological findings are not diagnostic of the disorder.
Structural and functional differences in brain areas associated with
affect regulation and affect processing, particularly
frontotemporal-limbic connections involving the brain's ventral
prefrontal cortex and amygdala, have been consistently noted in
individuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the
disorder. However, neuroimaging findings are not diagnostic of the
disorder.

Course modifiers.

Persistence is more likely for individuals with behaviors that meet
criteria for the childhood-onset subtype and qualify for the specifier
"with limited prosocial emotions". The risk that conduct disorder will
persist is also increased by co-occurring ADHD and by substance abuse.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Conduct disorder diagnosis may at times be potentially misapplied to
individuals in settings where patterns of disruptive behavior are viewed
as near-normative (e.g., in very threatening, high-crime areas or war
zones). Therefore, the context in which the undesirable behaviors have
occurred should be considered.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Males with a diagnosis of conduct disorder frequently exhibit fighting,
stealing, vandalism, and school discipline problems. Females with a
diagnosis of conduct disorder are more likely to exhibit lying, truancy,
running away, substance use, and prostitution. Whereas males tend to
exhibit both physical aggression and relational aggression (behavior
that harms social relationships of others), females tend to exhibit
relatively more relational aggression.

Functional Consequences of Conduct Disorder

Conduct disorder behaviors may lead to school suspension or expulsion,
problems in work adjustment, legal difficulties, sexually transmitted
diseases, unplanned pregnancy, and physical injury from accidents or
fights. These problems may preclude attendance in ordinary schools or
living in a parental or foster home. Conduct disorder is often
associated with an early onset of sexual behavior, alcohol use, tobacco
smoking, use of illegal substances, and reckless and risk-taking acts.
Accident rates appear to be higher among individuals with conduct
disorder compared with those without the disorder. These functional
consequences of conduct disorder may predict health difficulties when
individuals reach midlife. It is not uncommon for individuals with
conduct disorder to come into contact with the criminal justice system
for engaging in illegal behavior. Conduct disorder is a common reason
for treatment referral and is frequently diagnosed in mental health
facilities for children, especially in forensic practice. It is
associated with impairment that is more severe and chronic than that
experienced by other clinic-referred children.

Differential Diagnosis

Oppositional defiant disorder.

Conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are both related to
symptoms that bring the individual in conflict with adults and other au-

**475**

thority figures (e.g., parents, teachers, work supervisors). The
behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder are typically of a less
severe nature than those of individuals with conduct disorder and do not
include aggression toward individuals or animals, destruction of
property, or a pattern of theft or deceit. Furthermore, oppositional
defiant disorder includes problems of emotional dysregulation (i.e.,
angry and irritable mood) that are not included in the definition of
conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both oppositional defiant
disorder and conduct disorder, both diagnoses can be given.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Although children with ADHD often exhibit

hyperactive and impulsive behavior that may be disruptive, this behavior
does not by itself violate societal norms or the rights of others and
therefore does not usually meet criteria for conduct disorder. When
criteria are met for both ADHD and conduct disorder, both diagnoses
should be given.

Depressive and bipolar disorders.

Irritability, aggression, and conduct problems can

occur in children or adolescents with a major depressive disorder, a
bipolar disorder, or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The
behaviorial problems associated with these mood disorders can usually be
distinguished from the pattern of conduct problems seen in conduct
disorder based on their course. Specifically, persons with conduct
disorder will display substantial levels of aggressive or non-aggressive
conduct problems during periods in which there is no mood disturbance,
either historically (i.e., a history of conduct problems predating the
onset of the mood disturbance) or concurrently (i.e., display of some
conduct problems that are premeditated and do not occur during periods
of intense emotional arousal). In those cases in which criteria for
conduct disorder and a mood disorder are met, both diagnoses can be
given.

Intermittent explosive disorder.

Both conduct disorder and intermittent explosive disorder involve high
rates of aggression. However, the aggression in individuals with
intermittent explosive disorder is limited to impulsive aggression and
is not premeditated, and it is not committed in order to achieve some
tangible objective (e.g., money, power, intimidation). Also, the
definition of intermittent explosive disorder does not include the
non-aggressive symptoms of conduct disorder. If criteria for both
disorders are met, the diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder
should be given only when the recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts
warrant independent clinical attention.

Adjustment disorders.

The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder (with disturbance of conduct or
with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct) should be considered if
clinically significant conduct problems that do not meet the criteria
for another specific disorder develop in clear association with the
onset of a psychosocial stressor and do not resolve within 6 months of
the termination of the stressor (or its consequences). Conduct disorder
is diagnosed only when the conduct problems represent a repetitive and
persistent pattern that is associated with impairment in social,
academic, or occupational functioning.

Comorbidity

ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder are both common in individuals
with conduct disorder, and this comorbid presentation predicts worse
outcomes. Individuals who show the personality features associated with
antisocial personality disorder often violate the basic rights of others
or violate major age-appropriate societal norms, and as a result their
pattern of behavior often meets criteria for conduct disorder. Conduct
disorder may also co-occur with one or more of the following mental
disorders: specific learning disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive or
bipolar disorders, and substance-related disorders. Academic
achievement, particularly in reading and other verbal skills, is often
below the level expected on the basis of age and intelligence and may
justify the additional diagnosis of specific learning disorder or a
communication disorder.

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

Antisocial Personality Disorder

Criteria and text for antisocial personality disorder can be found in
the chapter "Personality Disorders." Because this disorder is closely
connected to the spectrum of "externalizing" conduct disorders in this
chapter, as well as to the disorders in the adjoining chapter

"Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders," it is dual coded here as
well as in the chapter "Personality Disorders."

Pyromania

Diagnostic Criteria

**312.33 (F63.1)**

A. Deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion.

B. Tension or affective arousal before the act.

C. Fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire
and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses, consequences).

D. Pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting fires or when
witnessing or participating in their aftermath.

E. The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an expression of
sociopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal activity, to express anger
or vengeance, to improve one's living circumstances, in response to a
delusion or hallucination, or as a result of impaired judgment (e.g., in
major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability \[intellectual
developmental disorder\], substance intoxication).

F. The fire setting is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic
episode, or antisocial personality disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of pyromania is the presence of multiple episodes
of deliberate and purposeful fire setting (Criterion A). Individuals
with this disorder experience tension or affective arousal before
setting a fire (Criterion B). There is a fascination with, interest in,
curiosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts
(e.g., paraphernalia, uses, consequences) (Criterion C). Individuals
with this disorder are often regular "watchers" at fires in their
neighborhoods, may set off false alarms, and derive pleasure from
institutions, equipment, and personnel associated with fire. They may
spend time at the local fire department, set fires to be affiliated with
the fire department, or even become firefighters. Individuals with this
disorder experience pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting the
fire, witnessing its effects, or participating in its aftermath
(Criterion D). The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an
expression of sociopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal activity, to
express anger or vengeance, to improve one's living circumstances, or in
response to a delusion or a hallucination (Criterion E). The fire
setting does not result from impaired judgment (e.g., in major
neurocognitive disorder or intellectual disability \[intellectual
developmental disorder\]). The diagnosis is not made if the fire setting
is better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial
personality disorder (Criterion F).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with pyromania may make considerable advance preparation for
starting a fire. They may be indifferent to the consequences to life or
property caused by the fire, or

[]{#index_split_034.html#p522}Pyromania

**477**

they may derive satisfaction from the resulting property destruction.
The behaviors may lead to property damage, legal consequences, or injury
or loss of life to the fire setter or to others. Individuals who
impulsively set fires (who may or may not have pyromania) often have a
current or past history of alcohol use disorder.

Prevalence

The population prevalence of pyromania is not known. The lifetime
prevalence of fire setting, which is just one component of pyromania and
not sufficient for a diagnosis by itself, was reported as 1.13% in a
population sample, but the most common comorbidities were antisocial
personality disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, and
pathological gambling (gambling disorder). In contrast, pyromania as a
primary diagnosis appears to be very rare. Among a sample of persons
reaching the criminal system with repeated fire setting, only 3.3% had
symptoms that met full criteria for pyromania.

Development and Course

There are insufficient data to establish a typical age at onset of
pyromania. The relationship between fire setting in childhood and
pyromania in adulthood has not been documented. In individuals with
pyromania, fire-setting incidents are episodic and may wax and wane in
frequency. Longitudinal course is unknown. Although fire setting is a
major problem in children and adolescents (over 40% of those arrested
for arson offenses in the United States are younger than 18 years),
pyromania in childhood appears to be rare. Ju-venile fire setting is
usually associated with conduct disorder,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or an adjustment disorder.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Pyromania occurs much more often in males, especially those with poorer
social skills and learning difficulties.

Differential Diagnosis

Other causes of intentional fire setting.

It is important to rule out other causes of fire

setting before giving the diagnosis of pyromania. Intentional fire
setting may occur for profit, sabotage, or revenge; to conceal a crime;
to make a political statement (e.g., an act of terrorism or protest); or
to attract attention or recognition (e.g., setting a fire in order to
discover it and save the day). Fire setting may also occur as part of
developmental experimentation in childhood (e.g., playing with matches,
lighters, or fire).

Other mental disorders.

A separate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire setting occurs
as part of conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality
disorder, or if it occurs in response to a delusion or a hallucination
(e.g., in schizophrenia) or is attributable to the physiological effects
of another medical condition (e.g., epilepsy). The diagnosis of
pyromania should also not be given when fire setting results from
impaired judgment associated with major neurocognitive disorder,
intellectual disability, or substance intoxication.

Comorbidity

There appears to be a high co-occurrence of substance use disorders,
gambling disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and other
disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders with pyromania.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p523}**478**

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

Kleptomania

Diagnostic Criteria

**312.32 (F63.2)**

A. Recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not
needed for personal use or for their monetary value.

B. Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the theft.

C. Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the
theft.

D. The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance and is
not in response to a delusion or a hallucination.

E. The stealing is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic
episode, or antisocial personality disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of kleptomania is the recurrent failure to resist
impulses to steal items even though the items are not needed for
personal use or for their monetary value (Criterion A). The individual
experiences a rising subjective sense of tension before the theft
(Criterion B) and feels pleasure, gratification, or relief when
committing the theft (Criterion C). The stealing is not committed to
express anger or vengeance, is not done in response to a delusion or
hallucination (Criterion D), and is not better explained by conduct
disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder (Criterion
E). The objects are stolen despite the fact that they are typically of
little value to the individual, who could have afforded to pay for them
and often gives them away or discards them. Occasionally the individual
may hoard the stolen objects or surreptitiously return them. Although
individuals with this disorder will generally avoid stealing when
immediate arrest is probable (e.g., in full view of a police officer),
they usually do not preplan the thefts or fully take into account the
chances of apprehension. The stealing is done without assistance from,
or collaboration with, others.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with kleptomania typically attempt to resist the impulse to
steal, and they are aware that the act is wrong and senseless. The
individual frequently fears being appre-hended and often feels depressed
or guilty about the thefts. Neurotransmitter pathways associated with
behavioral addictions, including those associated with the serotonin,
dopamine, and opioid systems, appear to play a role in kleptomania as
well.

Prevalence

Kleptomania occurs in about 4%--24% of individuals arrested for
shoplifting. Its prevalence in the general population is very rare, at
approximately 0.3%--0.6%. Females outnumber males at a ratio of 3:1.

Development and Course

Age at onset of kleptomania is variable, but the disorder often begins
in adolescence. However, the disorder may begin in childhood,
adolescence, or adulthood, and in rare cases in late adulthood. There is
little systematic information on the course of kleptomania, but three
typical courses have been described: sporadic with brief episodes and
long periods of remission; episodic with protracted periods of stealing
and periods of remission; and chronic with some degree of fluctuation.
The disorder may continue for years, despite multiple convictions for
shoplifting.

[]{#index_split_034.html#p524}Other Specified Disruptive,
Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder **479**

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

There are no controlled family history studies of kleptomania. However,
first-degree relatives of individuals with kleptomania may have higher
rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder than the general population.
There also appears to be a higher rate of substance use disorders,
including alcohol use disorder, in relatives of individuals with
kleptomania than in the general population.

Functional Consequences of Kleptomania

The disorder may cause legal, family, career, and personal difficulties.

Differential Diagnosis

Ordinary theft.

Kleptomania should be distinguished from ordinary acts of theft or
shoplifting. Ordinary theft (whether planned or impulsive) is deliberate
and is motivated by the usefulness of the object or its monetary worth.
Some individuals, especially adolescents, may also steal on a dare, as
an act of rebellion, or as a rite of passage. The diagnosis is not made
unless other characteristic features of kleptomania are also present.
Kleptomania is exceedingly rare, whereas shoplifting is relatively
common.

Malingering.

In malingering, individuals may simulate the symptoms of kleptomania to
avoid criminal prosecution.

Antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder.

Antisocial personality disorder

and conduct disorder are distinguished from kleptomania by a general
pattern of antisocial behavior.

Manic episodes, psychotic episodes, and major neurocognitive disorder.

Kleptomania

should be distinguished from intentional or inadvertent stealing that
may occur during a manic episode, in response to delusions or
hallucinations (as in, e.g., schizophrenia), or as a result of a major
neurocognitive disorder.

Comorbidity

Kleptomania may be associated with compulsive buying as well as with
depressive and bipolar disorders (especially major depressive disorder),
anxiety disorders, eating disorders (particularly bulimia nervosa),
personality disorders, substance use disorders (especially alcohol use
disorder), and other disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders.

Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control,

and Conduct Disorder

**312.89 (F91.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the
specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any
specific disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder. This is done
by recording "other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "recurrent behavioral
outbursts of insufficient frequency").

[]{#index_split_034.html#p525}**480**

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control,

and Conduct Disorder

**312.9 (F91.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason
that the criteria are not met for a specific disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

[]{#index_split_034.html#p526}**Substance-Related and**

**Addictive Disorders**

The substance-related disorders encompass 10 separate classes of drugs:
alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (with separate categories for
phencyclidine \[or similarly acting arylcyclohexylamines\] and other
hallucinogens); inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, and
anxiolytics; stimulants (amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, and other
stimulants); tobacco; and other (or unknown) substances. These 10
classes are not fully distinct. All drugs that are taken in excess have
in common direct activation of the brain reward system, which is
involved in the reinforcement of behaviors and the production of
memories. They produce such an intense activation of the reward system
that normal activities may be neglected. Instead of achieving reward
system activation through adaptive behaviors, drugs of abuse directly
activate the reward pathways. The pharmacological mechanisms by which
each class of drugs produces reward are different, but the drugs
typically activate the system and produce feelings of pleasure, often
referred to as a "high." Furthermore, individuals with lower levels of
self-control, which may reflect impairments of brain inhibitory
mechanisms, may be particularly predisposed to develop substance use
disorders, suggesting that the roots of substance use disorders for some
persons can be seen in behaviors long before the onset of actual
substance use itself.

In addition to the substance-related disorders, this chapter also
includes gambling disorder, reflecting evidence that gambling behaviors
activate reward systems similar to those activated by drugs of abuse and
produce some behavioral symptoms that appear comparable to those
produced by the substance use disorders. Other excessive behavioral
patterns, such as Internet gaming, have also been described, but the
research on these and other behavioral syndromes is less clear. Thus,
groups of repetitive behaviors, which some term *behavioral addictions,*
with such subcategories as "sex addiction," "exercise addiction,"

or "shopping addiction," are not included because at this time there is
insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria
and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental
disorders.

The substance-related disorders are divided into two groups: substance
use disorders and substance-induced disorders. The following conditions
may be classified as substance-induced: intoxication, withdrawal, and
other substance/medication-induced mental disorders (psychotic
disorders, bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety
disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, sleep disorders,
sexual dysfunctions, delirium, and neurocognitive disorders).

The current section begins with a general discussion of criteria sets
for a substance use disorder, substance intoxication and withdrawal, and
other substance/medication-induced mental disorders, at least some of
which are applicable across classes of substances. Reflecting some
unique aspects of the 10 substance classes relevant to this chapter, the
remainder of the chapter is organized by the class of substance and
describes their unique aspects. To facilitate differential diagnosis,
the text and criteria for the remaining substance/medication-induced
mental disorders are included with disorders with which they share
phenomenology (e.g., substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is
in the chapter "Depressive Disorders"). The broad diagnostic categories
associated with each specific group of substances are shown in Table 1.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p528}Substance Use Disorders

**483**

**Substance-Related Disorders**

**Substance Use Disorders**

Features

The essential feature of a substance use disorder is a cluster of
cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms indicating that the
individual continues using the substance despite significant
substance-related problems. As seen in Table 1, the diagnosis of a
substance use disorder can be applied to all 10 classes included in this
chapter except caffeine.

For certain classes some symptoms are less salient, and in a few
instances not all symptoms apply (e.g., withdrawal symptoms are not
specified for phencyclidine use disorder, other hallucinogen use
disorder, or inhalant use disorder).

An important characteristic of substance use disorders is an underlying
change in brain circuits that may persist beyond detoxification,
particularly in individuals with severe disorders.

The behavioral effects of these brain changes may be exhibited in the
repeated relapses and intense drug craving when the individuals are
exposed to drug-related stimuli. These persistent drug effects may
benefit from long-term approaches to treatment.

Overall, the diagnosis of a substance use disorder is based on a
pathological pattern of behaviors related to use of the substance. To
assist with organization, Criterion A criteria can be considered to fit
within overall groupings of *impaired control,* *social impairment,*
*risky use,* and *pharmacological criteria.* Impaired control over
substance use is the first criteria grouping (Criteria 1--4). The
individual may take the substance in larger amounts or over a longer
period than was originally intended (Criterion 1). The individual may
express a persistent desire to cut down or regulate substance use and
may report multiple unsuccessful efforts to decrease or discontinue use
(Criterion 2). The individual may spend a great deal of time obtaining
the substance, using the substance, or recovering from its effects
(Criterion 3). In some instances of more severe substance use disorders,
virtually all of the individual's daily activities revolve around the
substance. Craving (Criterion 4) is manifested by an intense desire or
urge for the drug that may occur at any time but is more likely when in
an environment where the drug previously was obtained or used. Craving
has also been shown to involve classical conditioning and is associated
with activation of specific reward structures in the brain. Craving is
queried by asking if there has ever been a time when they had such
strong urges to take the drug that they could not think of anything
else. Current craving is often used as a treatment outcome measure
because it may be a signal of impending relapse.

Social impairment is the second grouping of criteria (Criteria 5--7).
Recurrent substance use may result in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home (Criterion 5). The individual may
continue substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or
interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the
substance (Criterion 6). Important social, occupational, or recreational
activities may be given up or reduced because of substance use
(Criterion 7). The individual may withdraw from family activities and
hobbies in order to use the substance.

Risky use of the substance is the third grouping of criteria (Criteria
8--9). This may take the form of recurrent substance use in situations
in which it is physically hazardous (Criterion 8). The individual may
continue substance use despite knowledge of having a persistent or
recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been
caused or exacerbated by the substance (Criterion 9). The key issue in
evaluating this criterion is not the existence of the problem, but
rather the individual's failure to abstain from using the substance
despite the difficulty it is causing.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p529}**484**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Pharmacological criteria are the final grouping (Criteria 10 and 11).
Tolerance (Criterion 10) is signaled by requiring a markedly increased
dose of the substance to achieve the desired effect or a markedly
reduced effect when the usual dose is consumed. The degree to which
tolerance develops varies greatly across different individuals as well
as across substances and may involve a variety of central nervous system
effects. For example, tolerance to respiratory depression and tolerance
to sedating and motor coordination may develop at different rates,
depending on the substance. Tolerance may be difficult to determine by
history alone, and laboratory tests may be helpful (e.g., high blood
levels of the substance coupled with little evidence of intoxication
suggest that tolerance is likely). Tolerance must also be distinguished
from individual variability in the initial sensitivity to the effects of
particular substances. For example, some first-time alcohol drinkers
show very little evidence of intoxication with three or four drinks,
whereas others of similar weight and drinking histories have slurred
speech and incoordination.

Withdrawal (Criterion 11) is a syndrome that occurs when blood or tissue
concentrations of a substance decline in an individual who had
maintained prolonged heavy use of the substance. After developing
withdrawal symptoms, the individual is likely to consume the substance
to relieve the symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms vary greatly across the
classes of substances, and separate criteria sets for withdrawal are
provided for the drug classes. Marked and generally easily measured
physiological signs of withdrawal are common with alcohol, opioids, and
sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics. Withdrawal signs and symptoms
with stimulants (amphetamines and cocaine), as well as tobacco and
cannabis, are often present but may be less apparent. Significant
withdrawal has *not* been documented in humans after repeated use of
phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, and inhalants; therefore, this
criterion is not included for these substances. Neither tolerance nor
withdrawal is necessary for a diagnosis of a substance use disorder.
However, for most classes of substances, a past history of withdrawal is
associated with a more severe clinical course (i.e., an earlier onset of
a substance use disorder, higher levels of substance intake, and a
greater number of substance-related problems).

Symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal occurring during appropriate
medical treatment with prescribed medications (e.g., opioid analgesics,
sedatives, stimulants) are specifically *not* counted when diagnosing a
substance use disorder. The appearance of normal, expected
pharmacological tolerance and withdrawal during the course of medical
treatment has been known to lead to an erroneous diagnosis of
"addiction" even when these were the only symptoms present. Individuals
whose *only* symptoms are those that occur as a result of medical
treatment (i.e., tolerance and withdrawal as part of medical care when
the medications are taken as prescribed) should not receive a diagnosis
solely on the basis of these symptoms. However, prescription medications
can be used inappropriately, and a substance use disorder can be
correctly diagnosed when there are other symptoms of compulsive,
drug-seeking behavior.

Severity and Specifiers

Substance use disorders occur in a broad range of severity, from mild to
severe, with severity based on the number of symptom criteria endorsed.
As a general estimate of severity, a *mild* substance use disorder is
suggested by the presence of two to three symptoms, *moderate* by four
to five symptoms, and *severe* by six or more symptoms. Changing
severity across time is also reflected by reductions or increases in the
frequency and/or dose of substance use, as assessed by the individual's
own report, report of knowledgeable others, clinician's observations,
and biological testing. The following course specifiers and descriptive
features specifiers are also available for substance use disorders: "in
early remission,"

"in sustained remission," "on maintenance therapy," and "in a controlled
environment."

Definitions of each are provided within respective criteria sets.

Recording Procedures for Substance Use Disorders

The clinician should use the code that applies to the class of
substances but record the name of the *specific substance.* For example,
the clinician should record 304.10 (F13.20) moderate alprazolam use
disorder (rather than moderate sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorder) or 305.70 (F15.10) mild methamphetamine use disorder (rather
than mild stimulant use disorder). For substances that do not fit into
any of the classes (e.g., anabolic steroids), the appropriate code for
"other substance use disorder" should be used and the specific substance
indicated (e.g., 305.90 \[F19.10\] mild anabolic steroid use disorder).
If the substance taken by the individual is unknown, the code for the
class "other (or unknown)"

should be used (e.g., 304.90 \[F19.20\] severe unknown substance use
disorder). If criteria are met for more than one substance use disorder,
all should be diagnosed (e.g., 304.00

\[F11.20\] severe heroin use disorder; 304.20 \[F14.20\] moderate
cocaine use disorder).

The appropriate ICD-10-CM code for a substance use disorder depends on
whether there is a comorbid substance-induced disorder (including
intoxication and withdrawal). In the above example, the diagnostic code
for moderate alprazolam use disorder, F13.20, reflects the absence of a
comorbid alprazolam-induced mental disorder. Because ICD-10-CM

codes for substance-induced disorders indicate both the presence (or
absence) and severity of the substance use disorder, ICD-10-CM codes for
substance use disorders can be used only in the absence of a
substance-induced disorder. See the individual substance-specific
sections for additional coding information.

Note that the word *addiction* is not applied as a diagnostic term in
this classification, although it is in common usage in many countries to
describe severe problems related to compulsive and habitual use of
substances. The more neutral term *substance use disorder* is used to
describe the wide range of the disorder, from a mild form to a severe
state of chronically relapsing, compulsive drug taking. Some clinicians
will choose to use the word *addiction* to describe more extreme
presentations, but the word is omitted from the official DSM-5 substance
use disorder diagnostic terminology because of its uncertain definition
and its potentially negative connotation.

**Substance-Induced Disorders**

The overall category of substance-induced disorders includes
intoxication, withdrawal, and other substance/medication-induced mental
disorders (e.g., substance-induced psychotic disorder, substance-induced
depressive disorder).

Substance Intoxication and Withdrawal

Criteria for substance intoxication are included within the
substance-specific sections of this chapter. The essential feature is
the development of a reversible substance-specific syndrome due to the
recent ingestion of a substance (Criterion A). The clinically
significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes associated
with intoxication (e.g., belligerence, mood lability, impaired judgment)
are attributable to the physiological effects of the substance on the
central nervous system and develop during or shortly after use of the
substance (Criterion B). The symptoms are not attributable to another
medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder (Criterion D). Substance intoxication is common among those
with a substance use disorder but also occurs frequently in individuals
without a substance use disorder. This category does *not* apply to
tobacco.

The most common changes in intoxication involve disturbances of
perception, wakefulness, attention, thinking, judgment, psychomotor
behavior, and interpersonal behavior. Short-term, or "acute,"
intoxications may have different signs and symptoms than

[]{#index_split_065.html#p531}**486**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

sustained, or "chronic," intoxications. For example, moderate cocaine
doses may initially produce gregariousness, but social withdrawal may
develop if such doses are frequently repeated over days or weeks.

When used in the physiological sense, the term *intoxication* is broader
than substance intoxication as defined here. Many substances may produce
physiological or psychological changes that are not necessarily
problematic. For example, an individual with tachycardia from substance
use has a physiological effect, but if this is the only symptom in the
absence of problematic behavior, the diagnosis of intoxication would not
apply. Intoxication may sometimes persist beyond the time when the
substance is detectable in the body.

This may be due to enduring central nervous system effects, the recovery
of which takes longer than the time for elimination of the substance.
These longer-term effects of intoxication must be distinguished from
withdrawal (i.e., symptoms initiated by a decline in blood or tissue
concentrations of a substance).

Criteria for substance withdrawal are included within the
substance-specific sections of this chapter. The essential feature is
the development of a substance-specific problematic behavioral change,
with physiological and cognitive concomitants, that is due to the
cessation of, or reduction in, heavy and prolonged substance use
(Criterion A). The substance-specific syndrome causes clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms are not due
to another medical condition and are not better explained by another
mental disorder (Criterion D). Withdrawal is usually, but not always,
associated with a substance use disorder. Most individuals with
withdrawal have an urge to re-administer the substance to reduce the
symptoms.

Route of Administration and Speed of Substance Effects Routes of
administration that produce more rapid and efficient absorption into the
blood-stream (e.g., intravenous, smoking, intranasal "snorting") tend to
result in a more intense intoxication and an increased likelihood of an
escalating pattern of substance use leading to withdrawal. Similarly,
rapidly acting substances are more likely than slower-acting substances
to produce immediate intoxication.

Duration of Effects

Within the same drug category, relatively short-acting substances tend
to have a higher potential for the development of withdrawal than do
those with a longer duration of action. However, longer-acting
substances tend to have longer withdrawal duration. The half-life of the
substance parallels aspects of withdrawal: the longer the duration of
action, the longer the time between cessation and the onset of
withdrawal symptoms and the longer the withdrawal duration. In general,
the longer the acute withdrawal period, the less intense the syndrome
tends to be.

Use of Multiple Substances

Substance intoxication and withdrawal often involve several substances
used simultaneously or sequentially. In these cases, each diagnosis
should be recorded separately.

Associated Laboratory Findings

Laboratory analyses of blood and urine samples can help determine recent
use and the specific substances involved. However, a positive laboratory
test result does not by itself indicate that the individual has a
pattern of substance use that meets criteria for a substance-induced or
substance use disorder, and a negative test result does not by itself
rule out a diagnosis.

Laboratory tests can be useful in identifying withdrawal. If the
individual presents with withdrawal from an unknown substance,
laboratory tests may help identify the substance and may also be helpful
in differentiating withdrawal from other mental disorders.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p532}Substance-Induced Disorders

**487**

In addition, normal functioning in the presence of high blood levels of
a substance suggests considerable tolerance.

Development and Course

Individuals ages 18--24 years have relatively high prevalence rates for
the use of virtually every substance. Intoxication is usually the
initial substance-related disorder and often begins in the teens.
Withdrawal can occur at any age as long as the relevant drug has been
taken in sufficient doses over an extended period of time.

Recording Procedures for Intoxication and Withdrawal

The clinician should use the code that applies to the class of
substances but record the name of the *specific substance.* For example,
the clinician should record 292.0 (F13.239) secobarbital withdrawal
(rather than sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal) or 292.89

(F15.129) methamphetamine intoxication (rather than stimulant
intoxication). Note that the appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnostic code for
intoxication depends on whether there is a comorbid substance use
disorder. In this case, the F15.129 code for methamphetamine indicates
the presence of a comorbid mild methamphetamine use disorder. If there
had been no comorbid methamphetamine use disorder, the diagnostic code
would have been F15.929. ICD-10-CM coding rules require that all
withdrawal codes imply a comorbid moderate to severe substance use
disorder for that substance. In the above case, the code for
secobarbital withdrawal (F13.239) indicates the comorbid presence of a
moderate to severe secobarbital use disorder. See the coding note for
the substance-specific intoxication and withdrawal syndromes for the
actual coding options.

For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., anabolic
steroids), the appropriate code for "other substance intoxication"
should be used and the specific substance indicated (e.g., 292.89
\[F19.929\] anabolic steroid intoxication). If the substance taken by
the individual is unknown, the code for the class "other (or unknown)"
should be used (e.g., 292.89 \[F19.929\]

unknown substance intoxication). If there are symptoms or problems
associated with a particular substance but criteria are not met for any
of the substance-specific disorders, the unspecified category can be
used (e.g., 292.9 \[F12.99\] unspecified cannabis-related disorder).

As noted above, the substance-related codes in ICD-10-CM combine the
substance use disorder aspect of the clinical picture and the
substance-induced aspect into a single combined code. Thus, if both
heroin withdrawal and moderate heroin use disorder are present, the
single code F11.23 is given to cover both presentations. In ICD-9-CM,
separate diagnostic codes (292.0 and 304.00) are given to indicate
withdrawal and a moderate heroin use disorder, respectively. See the
individual substance-specific sections for additional coding
information.

Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders

The substance/medication-induced mental disorders are potentially
severe, usually temporary, but sometimes persisting central nervous
system (CNS) syndromes that develop in the context of the effects of
substances of abuse, medications, or several toxins. They are
distinguished from the substance use disorders, in which a cluster of
cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms contribute to the
continued use of a substance despite significant substance-related
problems. The substance/medication-induced mental disorders may be
induced by the 10 classes of substances that produce substance use
disorders, or by a great variety of other medications used in medical
treatment. Each substance-induced mental disorder is described in the
relevant chapter (e.g., "Depressive Disorders,"

"Neurocognitive Disorders"), and therefore, only a brief description is
offered here. All substance/medication-induced disorders share common
characteristics. It is important to recognize these common features to
aid in the detection of these disorders. These features are described as
follows:

[]{#index_split_065.html#p533}**488**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

A. The disorder represents a clinically significant symptomatic
presentation of a relevant mental disorder.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings of both of the following:

1\. The disorder developed during or within 1 month of a substance
intoxication or withdrawal or taking a medication; and

2\. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the mental
disorder.

C. The disorder is not better explained by an independent mental
disorder (i.e., one that is not substance-or medication-induced). Such
evidence of an independent mental disorder could include the following:

1\. The disorder preceded the onset of severe intoxication or withdrawal
or exposure to the medication; or

2\. The full mental disorder persisted for a substantial period of time
(e.g., at least 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or
severe intoxication or taking the medication. This criterion does not
apply to substance-induced neurocognitive disorders or hallucinogen
persisting perception disorder, which persist beyond the cessation of
acute intoxication or withdrawal.

D. The disorder does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disorder causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Features

Some generalizations can be made regarding the categories of substances
capable of producing clinically relevant substance-induced mental
disorders. In general, the more sedating drugs (sedative, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics, and alcohol) can produce prominent and clinically
significant depressive disorders during intoxication, while anxiety
conditions are likely to be observed during withdrawal syndromes from
these substances. Also, during intoxication, the more stimulating
substances (e.g., amphetamines and cocaine) are likely to be associated
with substance-induced psychotic disorders and substance-induced anxiety
disorders, with substance-induced major depressive episodes observed
during withdrawal.

Both the more sedating and more stimulating drugs are likely to produce
significant but temporary sleep and sexual disturbances. An overview of
the relationship between specific categories of substances and specific
psychiatric syndromes is presented in Table 1.

The medication-induced conditions include what are often idiosyncratic
CNS reactions or relatively extreme examples of side effects for a wide
range of medications taken for a variety of medical concerns. These
include neurocognitive complications of anesthetics, antihistamines,
antihypertensives, and a variety of other medications and toxins (e.g.,
organophosphates, insecticides, carbon monoxide), as described in the
chapter on neurocognitive disorders. Psychotic syndromes may be
temporarily experienced in the context of anticholinergic,
cardiovascular, and steroid drugs, as well as during use of
stimulant-like and depressant-like prescription or over-the-counter
drugs. Temporary but severe mood disturbances can be observed with a
wide range of medications, including steroids, antihypertensives,
disulfiram, and any prescription or over-the-counter depressant or
stimulant-like substances. A similar range of medications can be
associated with temporary anxiety syndromes, sexual dysfunctions, and
conditions of disturbed sleep.

In general, to be considered a substance/medication-induced mental
disorder, there must be evidence that the disorder being observed is not
likely to be better explained by an independent mental condition. The
latter are most likely to be seen if the mental disorder was present
before the severe intoxication or withdrawal or medication
administration, or, with the exception of several substance-induced
persisting disorders listed in Table 1, continued more than 1 month
after cessation of acute withdrawal, severe intoxication, or use
[]{#index_split_065.html#p534}Substance-Induced Disorders

**489**

of the medications. When symptoms are only observed during a delirium
(e.g., alcohol withdrawal delirium), the mental disorder should be
diagnosed as a delirium, and the psychiatric syndrome occurring during
the delirium should not also be diagnosed separately, as many symptoms
(including disturbances in mood, anxiety, and reality testing) are
commonly seen during agitated, confused states. The features associated
with each relevant major mental disorder are similar whether observed
with independent or substance/medication-induced mental disorders.
However, individuals with substance/

medication-induced mental disorders are likely to also demonstrate the
associated features seen with the specific category of substance or
medication, as listed in other subsections of this chapter.

Development and Course

Substance-induced mental disorders develop in the context of
intoxication or withdrawal from substances of abuse, and
medication-induced mental disorders are seen with prescribed or
over-the-counter medications that are taken at the suggested doses. Both
conditions are usually temporary and likely to disappear within 1 month
or so of cessation of acute withdrawal, severe intoxication, or use of
the medication. Exceptions to these generalizations occur for certain
long-duration substance-induced disorders: substance-associated
neurocognitive disorders that relate to conditions such as
alcohol-induced neurocognitive disorder, inhalant-induced neurocognitive
disorder, and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced neurocognitive
disorder; and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder ("flashbacks";
see the section "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders" later in this chapter).
However, most other substance/medication-induced mental disorders,
regardless of the severity of the symptoms, are likely to improve
relatively quickly with abstinence and unlikely to remain clinically
relevant for more than 1 month after complete cessation of use.

As is true of many consequences of heavy substance use, some individuals
are more and others less prone toward specific substance-induced
disorders. Similar types of predispositions may make some individuals
more likely to develop psychiatric side effects of some types of
medications, but not others. However, it is unclear whether individuals
with family histories or personal prior histories with independent
psychiatric syndromes are more likely to develop the induced syndrome
once the consideration is made as to whether the quantity and frequency
of the substance was sufficient to lead to the development of a
substance-induced syndrome.

There are indications that the intake of substances of abuse or some
medications with psychiatric side effects in the context of a
preexisting mental disorder is likely to result in an intensification of
the preexisting independent syndrome. The risk for
substance/medication-induced mental disorders is likely to increase with
both the quantity and the frequency of consumption of the relevant
substance.

The symptom profiles for the substance/medication-induced mental
disorders resemble independent mental disorders. While the symptoms of
substance/medication-induced mental disorders can be identical to those
of independent mental disorders (e.g., delusions, hallucinations,
psychoses, major depressive episodes, anxiety syndromes), and although
they can have the same severe consequences (e.g., suicide), most induced
mental disorders are likely to improve in a matter of days to weeks of
abstinence.

The substance/medication-induced mental disorders are an important part
of the differential diagnoses for the independent psychiatric
conditions. The importance of recognizing an induced mental disorder is
similar to the relevance of identifying the possible role of some
medical conditions and medication reactions before diagnosing an
independent mental disorder. Symptoms of substance-and
medication-induced mental disorders may be identical cross-sectionally
to those of independent mental disorders but have different treatments
and prognoses from the independent condition.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p535}**490**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Functional Consequences of Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders

The same consequences related to the relevant independent mental
disorder (e.g., suicide attempts) are likely to apply to the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders, but these are likely to
disappear within 1 month after abstinence. Similarly, the same
functional consequences associated with the relevant substance use
disorder are likely to be seen for the substance-induced mental
disorders.

Recording Procedures for Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders

Coding notes and separate recording procedures for ICD-9-CM and
ICD-10-CM codes for other specific substance/medication-induced mental
disorders are provided in other chapters of the manual with disorders
with which they share phenomenology (see the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters:
"Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders," "Bipolar and
Related Disorders," "Depressive Disorders," "Anxiety Disorders,"
"Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders," "Sleep-Wake Disorders,"
"Sexual Dysfunctions," and "Neurocognitive Disorders"). Generally, for
ICD-9-CM, if a mental disorder is induced by a substance use disorder, a
separate diagnostic code is given for the specific substance use
disorder, in addition to the code for the substance/medication-induced
mental disorder. For ICD-10-CM, a single code combines the
substance-induced mental disorder with the substance use disorder. A
separate diagnosis of the comorbid substance use disorder is not given,
although the name and severity of the specific substance use disorder
(when present) are used when recording the substance/medication-induced
mental disorder. ICD-10-CM codes are also provided for situations in
which the substance/medication-induced mental disorder is not induced by
a substance use disorder (e.g., when a disorder is induced by one-time
use of a substance or medication). Additional information needed to
record the diagnostic name of the substance/medication-induced mental
disorder is provided in the section "Recording Procedures" for each
substance/medication-induced mental disorder in its respective chapter.

**Alcohol-Related Disorders**

**Alcohol Use Disorder**

**Alcohol Intoxication**

**Alcohol Withdrawal**

**Other Alcohol-Induced Disorders**

**Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder**

Alcohol Use Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period: 1. Alcohol is often taken
in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.

2\. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control alcohol use.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p536}Alcohol Use Disorder

**491**

3\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain
alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects.

4\. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.

5\. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home.

6\. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social
or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of
alcohol.

7\. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of alcohol use.

8\. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous.

9\. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or
recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been
caused or exacerbated by alcohol.

10\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired
effect.

b\. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount
of alcohol.

11\. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The
characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to Criteria A and
B of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal, pp. 499--500).

b\. Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine)
is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

*Specify* if:

**In early remission:** After full criteria for alcohol use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder have
been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
alcohol," may be met).

**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for alcohol use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder have
been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
alcohol," may be met).

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to alcohol is
restricted.

**Code based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an
alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, or another alcohol-induced
mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for alcohol
use disorder. Instead, the comorbid alcohol use disorder is indicated in
the 4th character of the alcohol-induced disorder code (see the coding
note for alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, or a specific
alcohol-induced mental disorder).

For example, if there is comorbid alcohol intoxication and alcohol use
disorder, only the alcohol intoxication code is given, with the 4th
character indicating whether the comorbid alcohol use disorder is mild,
moderate, or severe: F10.129 for mild alcohol use disorder with alcohol
intoxication or F10.229 for a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder
with alcohol intoxication.

*Specify* current severity:

**305.00 (F10.10) Mild:** Presence of 2--3 symptoms.

**303.90 (F10.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4--5 symptoms.

**303.90 (F10.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p537}**492**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Specifiers

"In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier of
remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Severity of the disorder is based on the number of diagnostic criteria
endorsed. For a given individual, changes in severity of alcohol use
disorder across time are also reflected by reductions in the frequency
(e.g., days of use per month) and/or dose (e.g., number of standard
drinks consumed per day) of alcohol used, as assessed by the
individual's self-report, report of knowledgeable others, clinician
observations, and, when practical, biological testing (e.g., elevations
in blood tests as described in the section "Diagnostic Markers" for this
disorder).

Diagnostic Features

Alcohol use disorder is defined by a cluster of behavioral and physical
symptoms, which can include withdrawal, tolerance, and craving. Alcohol
withdrawal is characterized by withdrawal symptoms that develop
approximately 4--12 hours after the reduction of intake following
prolonged, heavy alcohol ingestion. Because withdrawal from alcohol can
be unpleasant and intense, individuals may continue to consume alcohol
despite adverse consequences, often to avoid or to relieve withdrawal
symptoms. Some withdrawal symptoms (e.g., sleep problems) can persist at
lower intensities for months and can contribute to relapse. Once a
pattern of repetitive and intense use develops, individuals with alcohol
use disorder may devote substantial periods of time to obtaining and
consuming alcoholic beverages.

Craving for alcohol is indicated by a strong desire to drink that makes
it difficult to think of anything else and that often results in the
onset of drinking. School and job performance may also suffer either
from the aftereffects of drinking or from actual intoxication at school
or on the job; child care or household responsibilities may be
neglected; and alcohol-related absences may occur from school or work.
The individual may use alcohol in physically hazardous circumstances
(e.g., driving an automobile, swimming, operating machinery while
intoxicated). Finally, individuals with an alcohol use disorder may
continue to consume alcohol despite the knowledge that continued
consumption poses significant physical (e.g., blackouts, liver disease),
psychological (e.g., depression), social, or interpersonal problems
(e.g., violent arguments with spouse while intoxicated, child abuse).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Alcohol use disorder is often associated with problems similar to those
associated with other substances (e.g., cannabis; cocaine; heroin;
amphetamines; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics). Alcohol may be used
to alleviate the unwanted effects of these other substances or to
substitute for them when they are not available. Symptoms of conduct
problems, depression, anxiety, and insomnia frequently accompany heavy
drinking and sometimes precede it.

Repeated intake of high doses of alcohol can affect nearly every organ
system, especially the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system,
and the central and peripheral nervous systems. Gastrointestinal effects
include gastritis, stomach or duodenal ulcers, and, in about 15% of
individuals who use alcohol heavily, liver cirrhosis and/or
pancreatitis.

There is also an increased rate of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, and
other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. One of the most commonly
associated conditions is low-grade hypertension. Cardiomyopathy and
other myopathies are less common but occur at an in-

[]{#index_split_065.html#p538}Alcohol Use Disorder

**493**

creased rate among those who drink very heavily. These factors, along
with marked increases in levels of triglycerides and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, contribute to an elevated risk of heart
disease. Peripheral neuropathy may be evidenced by muscular weakness,
paresthesias, and decreased peripheral sensation. More persistent
central nervous system effects include cognitive deficits, severe memory
impairment, and degenerative changes in the cerebellum. These effects
are related to the direct effects of alcohol or of trauma and to vitamin
deficiencies (particularly of the B vitamins, including thiamine).

One devastating central nervous system effect is the relatively rare
alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder, or Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome, in which the ability to encode new memory is severely
impaired. This condition would now be described within the chapter
"Neurocognitive Disorders" and would be termed a
*substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder.*

Alcohol use disorder is an important contributor to suicide risk during
severe intoxication and in the context of a temporary alcohol-induced
depressive and bipolar disorder.

There is an increased rate of suicidal behavior as well as of completed
suicide among individuals with the disorder.

Prevalence

Alcohol use disorder is a common disorder. In the United States, the
12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is estimated to be 4.6%
among 12-to 17-year-olds and 8.5% among adults age 18 years and older in
the United States. Rates of the disorder are greater among adult men
(12.4%) than among adult women (4.9%). Twelve-month prevalence of
alcohol use disorder among adults decreases in middle age, being
greatest among individuals 18-to 29-years-old (16.2%) and lowest among
individuals age 65 years and older (1.5%).

Twelve-month prevalence varies markedly across race/ethnic subgroups of
the U.S.

population. For 12-to 17-year-olds, rates are greatest among Hispanics
(6.0%) and Native Americans and Alaska Natives (5.7%) relative to whites
(5.0%), African Americans (1.8%), and Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders (1.6%). In contrast, among adults, the 12-month prevalence of
alcohol use disorder is clearly greater among Native Americans and
Alaska Natives (12.1%) than among whites (8.9%), Hispanics (7.9%),
African Americans (6.9%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
(4.5%).

Development and Course

The first episode of alcohol intoxication is likely to occur during the
mid-teens. Alcohol-related problems that do not meet full criteria for a
use disorder or isolated problems may occur prior to age 20 years, but
the age at onset of an alcohol use disorder with two or more of the
criteria clustered together peaks in the late teens or early to mid 20s.
The large majority of individuals who develop alcohol-related disorders
do so by their late 30s. The first evidence of withdrawal is not likely
to appear until after many other aspects of an alcohol use disorder have
developed. An earlier onset of alcohol use disorder is observed in
adolescents with preexisting conduct problems and those with an earlier
onset of intoxication.

Alcohol use disorder has a variable course that is characterized by
periods of remission and relapse. A decision to stop drinking, often in
response to a crisis, is likely to be followed by a period of weeks or
more of abstinence, which is often followed by limited periods of
controlled or nonproblematic drinking. However, once alcohol intake
resumes, it is highly likely that consumption will rapidly escalate and
that severe problems will once again develop.

Alcohol use disorder is often erroneously perceived as an intractable
condition, perhaps based on the fact that individuals who present for
treatment typically have a history of many years of severe
alcohol-related problems. However, these most severe cases represent
only a small proportion of individuals with this disorder, and the
typical individual with the disorder has a much more promising
prognosis.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p539}**494**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Among adolescents, conduct disorder and repeated antisocial behavior
often co-occur with alcohol-and with other substance-related disorders.
While most individuals with alcohol use disorder develop the condition
before age 40 years, perhaps 10% have later onset. Age-related physical
changes in older individuals result in increased brain susceptibility to
the depressant effects of alcohol; decreased rates of liver metabolism
of a variety of substances, including alcohol; and decreased percentages
of body water. These changes can cause older people to develop more
severe intoxication and subsequent problems at lower levels of
consumption. Alcohol-related problems in older people are also
especially likely to be associated with other medical complications.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Environmental risk and prognostic factors may include cultural attitudes
toward drinking and intoxication, the availability of alcohol (including
price), acquired personal experiences with alcohol, and stress levels.
Additional potential medi-ators of how alcohol problems develop in
predisposed individuals include heavier peer substance use, exaggerated
positive expectations of the effects of alcohol, and suboptimal ways of
coping with stress.

Genetic and physiological.

Alcohol use disorder runs in families, with 40%--60% of the variance of
risk explained by genetic influences. The rate of this condition is
three to four times higher in close relatives of individuals with
alcohol use disorder, with values highest for individuals with a greater
number of affected relatives, closer genetic relationships to the
affected person, and higher severity of the alcohol-related problems in
those relatives.

A significantly higher rate of alcohol use disorders exists in the
monozygotic twin than in the dizygotic twin of an individual with the
condition. A three-to fourfold increase in risk has been observed in
children of individuals with alcohol use disorder, even when these
children were given up for adoption at birth and raised by adoptive
parents who did not have the disorder.

Recent advances in our understanding of genes that operate through
intermediate characteristics (or phenotypes) to affect the risk of
alcohol use disorder can help to identify individuals who might be at
particularly low or high risk for alcohol use disorder. Among the
low-risk phenotypes are the acute alcohol-related skin flush (seen most
prominently in Asians). High vulnerability is associated with
preexisting schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, as well as impulsivity
(producing enhanced rates of all substance use disorders and gambling
disorder), and a high risk specifically for alcohol use disorder is
associated with a low level of response (low sensitivity) to alcohol. A
number of gene variations may account for low response to alcohol or
modulate the dopamine reward systems; it is important to note, however,
that any one gene variation is likely to explain only 1%--2% of the risk
for these disorders.

Course modifiers.

In general, high levels of impulsivity are associated with an earlier
onset and more severe alcohol use disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

In most cultures, alcohol is the most frequently used intoxicating
substance and contributes to considerable morbidity and mortality. An
estimated 3.8% of all global deaths and 4.6% of global
disability-adjusted life-years are attributable to alcohol. In the
United States, 80% of adults (age 18 years and older) have consumed
alcohol at some time in their lives, and 65% are current drinkers (last
12 months). An estimated 3.6% of the world population (15--64 years old)
has a current (12-month) alcohol use disorder, with a lower prevalence
(1.1%) found in the African region, a higher rate (5.2%) found in the
American region (North, South, and Central America and the Caribbean),
and the highest rate (10.9%) found in the Eastern Europe region.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p540}Alcohol Use Disorder

**495**

Polymorphisms of genes for the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes alcohol
dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase are most often seen in Asians
and affect the response to alcohol. When consuming alcohol, individuals
with these gene variations can experience a flushed face and
palpitations, reactions that can be so severe as to limit or preclude
future alcohol consumption and diminish the risk for alcohol use
disorder. These gene variations are seen in as many as 40% of Japanese,
Chinese, Korean, and related groups worldwide and are related to lower
risks for the disorder.

Despite small variations regarding individual criterion items, the
diagnostic criteria perform equally well across most race/ethnicity
groups.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Males have higher rates of drinking and related disorders than females.
However, because females generally weigh less than males, have more fat
and less water in their bodies, and metabolize less alcohol in their
esophagus and stomach, they are likely to develop higher blood alcohol
levels per drink than males. Females who drink heavily may also be more
vulnerable than males to some of the physical consequences associated
with alcohol, including liver disease.

Diagnostic Markers

Individuals whose heavier drinking places them at elevated risk for
alcohol use disorder can be identified both through standardized
questionnaires and by elevations in blood test results likely to be seen
with regular heavier drinking. These measures do not establish a
diagnosis of an alcohol-related disorder but can be useful in
highlighting individuals for whom more information should be gathered.
The most direct test available to measure alcohol consumption
cross-sectionally is *blood alcohol concentration,* which can also be
used to judge tolerance to alcohol. For example, an individual with a
concentration of 150 mg of ethanol per deciliter (dL) of blood who does
not show signs of intoxication can be presumed to have acquired at least
some degree of tolerance to alcohol. At 200 mg/dL, most nontolerant
individuals demonstrate severe intoxication.

Regarding laboratory tests, one sensitive laboratory indicator of heavy
drinking is a modest elevation or high-normal levels (\>35 units) of
gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT).

This may be the only laboratory finding. At least 70% of individuals
with a high GGT level are persistent heavy drinkers (i.e., consuming
eight or more drinks daily on a regular basis).

A second test with comparable or even higher levels of sensitivity and
specificity is carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), with levels of
20 units or higher useful in identifying individuals who regularly
consume eight or more drinks daily. Since both GGT and CDT

levels return toward normal within days to weeks of stopping drinking,
both state markers may be useful in monitoring abstinence, especially
when the clinician observes increases, rather than decreases, in these
values over time---a finding indicating that the person is likely to
have returned to heavy drinking. The combination of tests for CDT and
GGT may have even higher levels of sensitivity and specificity than
either test used alone. Additional useful tests include the mean
corpuscular volume (MCV), which may be elevated to high-normal values in
individuals who drink heavily---a change that is due to the direct toxic
effects of alcohol on erythropoiesis. Although the MCV can be used to
help identify those who drink heavily, it is a poor method of monitoring
abstinence because of the long half-life of red blood cells. Liver
function tests (e.g., alanine aminotransferase \[ALT\] and alkaline
phos-phatase) can reveal liver injury that is a consequence of heavy
drinking. Other potential markers of heavy drinking that are more
nonspecific for alcohol but can help the clinician think of the possible
effects of alcohol include elevations in blood levels or lipids (e.g.,
triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and high-normal
levels of uric acid.

Additional diagnostic markers relate to signs and symptoms that reflect
the consequences often associated with persistent heavy drinking. For
example, dyspepsia, nausea, and bloat-

[]{#index_split_065.html#p541}**496**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

ing can accompany gastritis, and hepatomegaly, esophageal varices, and
hemorrhoids may reflect alcohol-induced changes in the liver. Other
physical signs of heavy drinking include tremor, unsteady gait,
insomnia, and erectile dysfunction. Males with chronic alcohol use
disorder may exhibit decreased testicular size and feminizing effects
associated with reduced testosterone levels. Repeated heavy drinking in
females is associated with menstrual irregularities and, during
pregnancy, spontaneous abortion and fetal alcohol syndrome. Individuals
with preexisting histories of epilepsy or severe head trauma are more
likely to develop alcohol-related seizures. Alcohol withdrawal may be
associated with nausea, vomiting, gastritis, hematemesis, dry mouth,
puffy blotchy complexion, and mild peripheral edema.

Functional Consequences of Alcohol Use Disorder

The diagnostic features of alcohol use disorder highlight major areas of
life functioning likely to be impaired. These include driving and
operating machinery, school and work, interpersonal relationships and
communication, and health. Alcohol-related disorders contribute to
absenteeism from work, job-related accidents, and low employee
productivity. Rates are elevated in homeless individuals, perhaps
reflecting a downward spiral in social and occupational functioning,
although most individuals with alcohol use disorder continue to live
with their families and function within their jobs.

Alcohol use disorder is associated with a significant increase in the
risk of accidents, violence, and suicide. It is estimated that one in
five intensive care unit admissions in some urban hospitals is related
to alcohol and that 40% of individuals in the United States experience
an alcohol-related adverse event at some time in their lives, with
alcohol accounting for up to 55% of fatal driving events. Severe alcohol
use disorder, especially in individuals with antisocial personality
disorder, is associated with the commission of criminal acts, including
homicide. Severe problematic alcohol use also contributes to
disinhibition and feelings of sadness and irritability, which contribute
to suicide attempts and completed suicides.

Unanticipated alcohol withdrawal in hospitalized individuals for whom a
diagnosis of alcohol use disorder has been overlooked can add to the
risks and costs of hospitalization and to time spent in the hospital.

Differential Diagnosis

Nonpathological use of alcohol.

The key element of alcohol use disorder is the use of heavy doses of
alcohol with resulting repeated and significant distress or impaired
functioning. While most drinkers sometimes consume enough alcohol to
feel intoxicated, only a minority (less than 20%) ever develop alcohol
use disorder. Therefore, drinking, even daily, in low doses and
occasional intoxication do not by themselves make this diagnosis.

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.

The signs and symptoms of alcohol use

disorder are similar to those seen in sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder. The two must be distinguished, however, because the course
may be different, especially in relation to medical problems.

Conduct disorder in childhood and adult antisocial personality disorder.

Alcohol use

disorder, along with other substance use disorders, is seen in the
majority of individuals with antisocial personality and preexisting
conduct disorder. Because these diagnoses are associated with an early
onset of alcohol use disorder as well as a worse prognosis, it is
important to establish both conditions.

Comorbidity

Bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and antisocial personality disorder
are associated with a markedly increased rate of alcohol use disorder,
and several anxiety and depressive disorders

[]{#index_split_065.html#p542}Alcohol Intoxication

**497**

may relate to alcohol use disorder as well. At least a part of the
reported association between depression and moderate to severe alcohol
use disorder may be attributable to temporary, alcohol-induced comorbid
depressive symptoms resulting from the acute effects of intoxication or
withdrawal. Severe, repeated alcohol intoxication may also suppress
immune mechanisms and predispose individuals to infections and increase
the risk for cancers.

Alcohol Intoxication

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Recent ingestion of alcohol.

B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood
lability, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after,
alcohol ingestion.

C. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during,
or shortly after, alcohol use:

1\. Slurred speech.

2\. Incoordination.

3\. Unsteady gait.

4\. Nystagmus.

5\. Impairment in attention or memory.

6\. Stupor or coma.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **303.00.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid alcohol use disorder. If a mild
alcohol use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F10.129,** and
if a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM
code is **F10.229.** If there is no comorbid alcohol use disorder, then
the ICD-10-CM code is **F10.929.**

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of alcohol intoxication is the presence of
clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes
(e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability,
impaired judgment, impaired social or occupational functioning) that
develop during, or shortly after, alcohol ingestion (Criterion B). These
changes are accompanied by evidence of impaired functioning and judgment
and, if intoxication is intense, can result in a life-threatening coma.
The symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition
(e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis), are not a reflection of conditions such
as delirium, and are not related to intoxication with other depressant
drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) (Criterion D). The levels of
incoordination can interfere with driving abilities and performance of
usual activities to the point of causing accidents. Evidence of alcohol
use can be obtained by smelling alcohol on the individual's breath,
eliciting a history from the individual or another observer, and, when
needed, having the individual provide breath, blood, or urine samples
for toxicology analyses.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Alcohol intoxication is sometimes associated with amnesia for the events
that occurred during the course of the intoxication ("blackouts"). This
phenomenon may be related to the presence of a high blood alcohol level
and, perhaps, to the rapidity with which this level is reached. During
even mild alcohol intoxication, different symptoms are likely to be

[]{#index_split_065.html#p543}**498**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

observed at different time points. Evidence of mild intoxication with
alcohol can be seen in most individuals after approximately two drinks
(each standard drink is approximately 10--12 grams of ethanol and raises
the blood alcohol concentration approximately 20 mg/

dL). Early in the drinking period, when blood alcohol levels are rising,
symptoms often include talkativeness, a sensation of well-being, and a
bright, expansive mood. Later, especially when blood alcohol levels are
falling, the individual is likely to become progressively more
depressed, withdrawn, and cognitively impaired. At very high blood
alcohol levels (e.g., 200--300 mg/dL), an individual who has not
developed tolerance for alcohol is likely to fall asleep and enter a
first stage of anesthesia. Higher blood alcohol levels (e.g., in excess
of 300--400 mg/dL) can cause inhibition of respiration and pulse and
even death in nontolerant individuals. The duration of intoxication
depends on how much alcohol was consumed over what period of time. In
general, the body is able to metabolize approximately one drink per
hour, so that the blood alcohol level generally decreases at a rate of
15--20 mg/dL per hour. Signs and symptoms of intoxication are likely to
be more intense when the blood alcohol level is rising than when it is
falling.

Alcohol intoxication is an important contributor to suicidal behavior.
There appears to be an increased rate of suicidal behavior, as well as
of completed suicide, among persons intoxicated by alcohol.

Prevalence

The large majority of alcohol consumers are likely to have been
intoxicated to some degree at some point in their lives. For example, in
2010, 44% of 12th-grade students admitted to having been "drunk in the
past year," with more than 70% of college students reporting the same.

Development and Course

Intoxication usually occurs as an episode usually developing over
minutes to hours and typically lasting several hours. In the United
States, the average age at first intoxication is approximately 15 years,
with the highest prevalence at approximately 18--25 years. Frequency and
intensity usually decrease with further advancing age. The earlier the
onset of regular intoxication, the greater the likelihood the individual
will go on to develop alcohol use disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Episodes of alcohol intoxication increase with personality
characteristics of sensation seeking and impulsivity.

Environmental.

Episodes of alcohol intoxication increase with a heavy drinking
environment.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The major issues parallel the cultural differences regarding the use of
alcohol overall.

Thus, college fraternities and sororities may encourage alcohol
intoxication. This condition is also frequent on certain dates of
cultural significance (e.g., New Year's Eve) and, for some subgroups,
during specific events (e.g., wakes following funerals). Other subgroups
encourage drinking at religious celebrations (e.g., Jewish and Catholic
holidays), while still others strongly discourage all drinking or
intoxication (e.g., some religious groups, such as Mormons,
fundamentalist Christians, and Muslims).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Historically, in many Western societies, acceptance of drinking and
drunkenness is more tolerated for males, but such gender differences may
be much less prominent in recent years, especially during adolescence
and young adulthood.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p544}Alcohol Withdrawal

**499**

Diagnostic Markers

Intoxication is usually established by observing an individual's
behavior and smelling alcohol on the breath. The degree of intoxication
increases with an individual's blood or breath alcohol level and with
the ingestion of other substances, especially those with sedating
effects.

Functional Consequences of Alcohol Intoxication

Alcohol intoxication contributes to the more than 30,000 alcohol-related
drinking deaths in the United States each year. In addition,
intoxication with this drug contributes to huge costs associated with
drunk driving, lost time from school or work, as well as interpersonal
arguments and physical fights.

Differential Diagnosis

Other medical conditions.

Several medical (e.g., diabetic acidosis) and neurological conditions
(e.g., cerebellar ataxia, multiple sclerosis) can temporarily resemble
alcohol intoxication.

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication.

Intoxication with sedative, hypnotic, or

anxiolytic drugs or with other sedating substances (e.g.,
antihistamines, anticholinergic drugs) can be mistaken for alcohol
intoxication. The differential requires observing alcohol on the breath,
measuring blood or breath alcohol levels, ordering a medical workup, and
gathering a good history. The signs and symptoms of sedative-hypnotic
intoxication are very similar to those observed with alcohol and include
similar problematic behavioral or psychological changes. These changes
are accompanied by evidence of impaired functioning and
judgment---which, if intense, can result in a life-threatening
coma---and levels of incoordination that can interfere with driving
abilities and with performing usual activities. However, there is no
smell as there is with alcohol, but there is likely to be evidence of
misuse of the depressant drug in the blood or urine toxicology analyses.

Comorbidity

Alcohol intoxication may occur comorbidly with other substance
intoxication, especially in individuals with conduct disorder or
antisocial personality disorder.

Alcohol Withdrawal

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use that has been heavy and
prolonged.

B. Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours to a
few days after the cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use described
in Criterion A: 1. Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or pulse rate
greater than 100 bpm).

2\. Increased hand tremor.

3\. Insomnia.

4\. Nausea or vomiting.

5\. Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions.

6\. Psychomotor agitation.

7\. Anxiety.

8\. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p545}**500**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

*Specify* if:

**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier applies in the rare
instance when hallucinations (usually visual or tactile) occur with
intact reality testing, or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur
in the absence of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **291.81.** The ICD-10-CM code for
alcohol withdrawal without perceptual disturbances is **F10.239,** and
the ICD-10-CM code for alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances
is **F10.232.** Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid
presence of a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder, reflecting the
fact that alcohol withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a
moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. It is not permissible to code a
comorbid mild alcohol use disorder with alcohol withdrawal.

Specifiers

When hallucinations occur in the absence of delirium (i.e., in a clear
sensorium), a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder should be considered.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of alcohol withdrawal is the presence of a
characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops within several hours to
a few days after the cessation of (or reduction in) heavy and prolonged
alcohol use (Criteria A and B). The withdrawal syndrome includes two or
more of the symptoms reflecting autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety
listed in Criterion B, along with gastrointestinal symptoms.

Withdrawal symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
(Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.,
generalized anxiety disorder), including intoxication or withdrawal from
another substance (e.g., sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal)
(Criterion D).

Symptoms can be relieved by administering alcohol or benzodiazepines
(e.g., diazepam).

The withdrawal symptoms typically begin when blood concentrations of
alcohol decline sharply (i.e., within 4--12 hours) after alcohol use has
been stopped or reduced. Reflecting the relatively fast metabolism of
alcohol, symptoms of alcohol withdrawal usually peak in intensity during
the second day of abstinence and are likely to improve markedly by the
fourth or fifth day. Following acute withdrawal, however, symptoms of
anxiety, insomnia, and autonomic dysfunction may persist for up to 3--6
months at lower levels of intensity.

Fewer than 10% of individuals who develop alcohol withdrawal will ever
develop dramatic symptoms (e.g., severe autonomic hyperactivity,
tremors, alcohol withdrawal delirium). Tonic-clonic seizures occur in
fewer than 3% of individuals.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Although confusion and changes in consciousness are not core criteria
for alcohol withdrawal, alcohol withdrawal delirium (see "Delirium" in
the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders") may occur in the context of
withdrawal. As is true for any agitated, confused state, regardless of
the cause, in addition to a disturbance of consciousness and cognition,
withdrawal delirium can include visual, tactile, or (rarely) auditory
hallucinations (delirium tremens). When alcohol withdrawal delirium
develops, it is likely that a clinically relevant medical condition may
be present (e.g., liver failure, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding,
sequelae of head trauma, hypoglycemia, an electrolyte imbalance,
postoperative status).

[]{#index_split_065.html#p546}Alcohol Withdrawal

**501**

Prevalence

It is estimated that approximately 50% of middle-class, highly
functional individuals with alcohol use disorder have ever experienced a
full alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Among individuals with alcohol use
disorder who are hospitalized or homeless, the rate of alcohol
withdrawal may be greater than 80%. Less than 10% of individuals in
withdrawal ever demonstrate alcohol withdrawal delirium or withdrawal
seizures.

Development and Course

Acute alcohol withdrawal occurs as an episode usually lasting 4--5 days
and only after extended periods of heavy drinking. Withdrawal is
relatively rare in individuals younger than 30 years, and the risk and
severity increase with increasing age.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

The probability of developing alcohol withdrawal increases with the
quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption. Most individuals with
this condition are drinking daily, consuming large amounts
(approximately more than eight drinks per day) for multiple days.
However, there are large inter-individual differences, with enhanced
risks for individuals with concurrent medical conditions, those with
family histories of alcohol withdrawal (i.e., a genetic component),
those with prior withdrawals, and individuals who consume sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs.

Diagnostic Markers

Autonomic hyperactivity in the context of moderately high but falling
blood alcohol levels and a history of prolonged heavy drinking indicate
a likelihood of alcohol withdrawal.

Functional Consequences of Alcohol Withdrawal

Symptoms of withdrawal may serve to perpetuate drinking behaviors and
contribute to relapse, resulting in persistently impaired social and
occupational functioning. Symptoms requiring medically supervised
detoxification result in hospital utilization and loss of work
productivity. Overall, the presence of withdrawal is associated with
greater functional impairment and poor prognosis.

Differential Diagnosis

Other medical conditions.

The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can also be mimicked by some medical
conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis). Essential
tremor, a disorder that frequently runs in families, may erroneously
suggest the tremulousness associated with alcohol withdrawal.

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal produces a syndrome very
similar to that of alcohol withdrawal.

Comorbidity

Withdrawal is more likely to occur with heavier alcohol intake, and that
might be most often observed in individuals with conduct disorder and
antisocial personality disorder.

Withdrawal states are also more severe in older individuals, individuals
who are also dependent on other depressant drugs (sedative-hypnotics),
and individuals who have had more alcohol withdrawal experiences in the
past.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p547}**502**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

**Other Alcohol-Induced Disorders**

The following alcohol-induced disorders are described in other chapters
of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see
the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
alcohol-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other
Psychotic Disorders"); alcohol-induced bipolar disorder ("Bipolar and
Related Disorders"); alcohol-induced depressive disorder ("Depressive
Disorders"); alcohol-induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety Disorders");
alcohol-induced sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"); alcohol-induced
sexual dysfunction ("Sexual Dysfunctions"); and alcohol-induced major or
mild neurocognitive disorder ("Neurocognitive Disorders"). For alcohol
intoxication delirium and alcohol withdrawal delirium, see the criteria
and discussion of delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders."
These alcohol-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of alcohol
intoxication or alcohol withdrawal only when the symptoms are
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Features

The symptom profiles for an alcohol-induced condition resemble
independent mental disorders as described elsewhere in DSM-5. However,
the alcohol-induced disorder is temporary and observed after severe
intoxication with and/or withdrawal from alcohol. While the symptoms can
be identical to those of independent mental disorders (e.g., psychoses,
major depressive disorder), and while they can have the same severe
consequences (e.g., suicide attempts), alcohol-induced conditions are
likely to improve without formal treatment in a matter of days to weeks
after cessation of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal.

Each alcohol-induced mental disorder is listed in the relevant
diagnostic section and therefore only a brief description is offered
here. Alcohol-induced disorders must have developed in the context of
severe intoxication and/or withdrawal from the substance capable of
producing the mental disorder. In addition, there must be evidence that
the disorder being observed is not likely to be better explained by
another non-alcohol-induced mental disorder. The latter is likely to
occur if the mental disorder was present before the severe intoxication
or withdrawal, or continued more than 1 month after the cessation of
severe intoxication and/or withdrawal. When symptoms are observed only
during a delirium, they should be considered part of the delirium and
not diagnosed separately, as many symptoms (including disturbances in
mood, anxiety, and reality testing) are commonly seen during agitated,
confused states. The alcohol-induced disorder must be clinically
relevant, causing significant levels of distress or significant
functional impairment. Finally, there are indications that the intake of
substances of abuse in the context of a preexisting mental disorder are
likely to result in an intensification of the preexisting independent
syndrome.

The features associated with each relevant major mental disorder (e.g.,
psychotic episodes, major depressive disorder) are similar whether
observed with an independent or an alcohol-induced condition. However,
individuals with alcohol-induced disorders are likely to also
demonstrate the associated features seen with an alcohol use disorder,
as listed in the subsections of this chapter.

Rates of alcohol-induced disorders vary somewhat by diagnostic category.
For example, the lifetime risk for major depressive episodes in
individuals with alcohol use disorder is approximately 40%, but only
about one-third to one-half of these represent independent major
depressive syndromes observed outside the context of intoxication.
Similar rates of alcohol-induced sleep and anxiety conditions are
likely, but alcohol-induced psychotic episodes are fairly rare.

Development and Course

Once present, the symptoms of an alcohol-induced condition are likely to
remain clinically relevant as long as the individual continues to
experience severe intoxication and/or with-

[]{#index_split_065.html#p548}Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder
**503**

drawal. While the symptoms are identical to those of independent mental
disorders (e.g., psychoses, major depressive disorder), and while they
can have the same severe consequences (e.g., suicide attempts), all
alcohol-induced syndromes other than alcohol-induced neurocognitive
disorder, amnestic confabulatory type (alcohol-induced persisting
amnestic disorder), regardless of the severity of the symptoms, are
likely to improve relatively quickly and unlikely to remain clinically
relevant for more than 1 month after cessation of severe intoxication
and/or withdrawal.

The alcohol-induced disorders are an important part of the differential
diagnoses for the independent mental conditions. Independent
schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety
disorders, such as panic disorder, are likely to be associated with much
longer-lasting periods of symptoms and often require longer-term
medications to optimize the probability of improvement or recovery. The
alcohol-induced conditions, on the other hand, are likely to be much
shorter in duration and disappear within several days to 1 month after
cessation of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal, even without
psychotropic medications.

The importance of recognizing an alcohol-induced disorder is similar to
the relevance of identifying the possible role of some endocrine
conditions and medication reactions before diagnosing an independent
mental disorder. In light of the high prevalence of alcohol use
disorders worldwide, it is important that these alcohol-induced
diagnoses be considered before independent mental disorders are
diagnosed.

Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder

**291.9 (F10.99)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an alcohol-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific alcohol-related disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

or shortly after, caffeine use:

1\. Restlessness.

distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance.

Diagnostic Features

Caffeine can be consumed from a number of different sources, including
coffee, tea, caffeinated soda, "energy" drinks, over-the-counter
analgesics and cold remedies, energy aids (e.g., drinks), weight-loss
aids, and chocolate. Caffeine is also increasingly being used as an
additive to vitamins and to food products. More than 85% of children and
adults consume caffeine regularly. Some caffeine users display symptoms
consistent with problematic use, including tolerance and withdrawal (see
"Caffeine Withdrawal" later in this chapter); the data are not available
at this time to determine the clinical significance of a caffeine use
disorder and its prevalence. In contrast, there is evidence that
caffeine withdrawal and caffeine intoxication are clinically significant
and sufficiently prevalent.

The essential feature of caffeine intoxication is recent consumption of
caffeine and five or more signs or symptoms that develop during or
shortly after caffeine use (Criteria A and B). Symptoms include
restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, diuresis,
and gastrointestinal complaints, which can occur with low doses (e.g.,
200 mg) in vulnerable individuals such as children, the elderly, or
individuals who have not been exposed to caffeine previously. Symptoms
that generally appear at levels of more than 1 g/

day include muscle twitching, rambling flow of thought and speech,
tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia, periods of inexhaustibility, and
psychomotor agitation. Caffeine intoxication may not occur despite high
caffeine intake because of the development of tolerance.

The signs or symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning (Criterion C). The signs or symptoms must not be
attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained
by another mental disorder (e.g., an anxiety disorder) or intoxication
with another substance (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Mild sensory disturbances (e.g., ringing in the ears and flashes of
light) may occur with high doses of caffeine. Although large doses of
caffeine can increase heart rate, smaller doses can slow heart rate.
Whether excess caffeine intake can cause headaches is unclear. On
physical examination, agitation, restlessness, sweating, tachycardia,
flushed face, and increased bowel motility may be seen. Caffeine blood
levels may provide important information for diagnosis, particularly
when the individual is a poor historian, although these levels are not
diagnostic by themselves in view of the individual variation in response
to caffeine.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p550}Caffeine Intoxication

**505**

Prevalence

The prevalence of caffeine intoxication in the general population is
unclear. In the United States, approximately 7% of individuals in the
population may experience five or more symptoms along with functional
impairment consistent with a diagnosis of caffeine intoxication.

Development and Course

Consistent with a half-life of caffeine of approximately 4--6 hours,
caffeine intoxication symptoms usually remit within the first day or so
and do not have any known long-lasting consequences. However,
individuals who consume very high doses of caffeine (i.e., 5--10

g\) may require immediate medical attention, as such doses can be
lethal.

With advancing age, individuals are likely to demonstrate increasingly
intense reactions to caffeine, with greater complaints of interference
with sleep or feelings of hyperarousal. Caffeine intoxication among
young individuals after consumption of highly caffeinated products,
including energy drinks, has been observed. Children and adolescents may
be at increased risk for caffeine intoxication because of low body
weight, lack of tolerance, and lack of knowledge about the
pharmacological effects of caffeine.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Caffeine intoxication is often seen among individuals who use caffeine
less frequently or in those who have recently increased their caffeine
intake by a substantial amount. Furthermore, oral contraceptives
significantly decrease the elimination of caffeine and consequently may
increase the risk of intoxication.

Genetic and physiological.

Genetic factors may affect risk of caffeine intoxication.

Functional Consequences of Caffeine Intoxication

Impairment from caffeine intoxication may have serious consequences,
including dysfunction at work or school, social indiscretions, or
failure to fulfill role obligations. Moreover, extremely high doses of
caffeine can be fatal. In some cases, caffeine intoxication may
precipitate a caffeine-induced disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders.

Caffeine intoxication may be characterized by symptoms (e.g., panic
attacks) that resemble primary mental disorders. To meet criteria for
caffeine intoxication, the symptoms must not be associated with another
medical condition or another mental disorder, such as an anxiety
disorder, that could better explain them. Manic episodes; panic
disorder; generalized anxiety disorder; amphetamine intoxication;
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal or tobacco withdrawal;
sleep disorders; and medication-induced side effects (e.g., akathisia)
can cause a clinical picture that is similar to that of caffeine
intoxication.

Other caffeine-induced disorders.

The temporal relationship of the symptoms to increased caffeine use or
to abstinence from caffeine helps to establish the diagnosis. Caffeine
intoxication is differentiated from caffeine-induced anxiety disorder,
with onset during intoxication (see "Substance/Medication-Induced
Anxiety Disorder" in the chapter "Anxiety Disorders"), and
caffeine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication (see
"Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder" in the chapter "Sleep-Wake
Disorders"), by the fact that the symptoms in these latter disorders are
in excess of those usually associated with caffeine intoxication and are
severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p551}**506**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Comorbidity

Typical dietary doses of caffeine have not been consistently associated
with medical problems. However, heavy use (e.g., \>400 mg) can cause or
exacerbate anxiety and somatic symptoms and gastrointestinal distress.
With acute, extremely high doses of caffeine, grand mal seizures and
respiratory failure may result in death. Excessive caffeine use is
associated with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, eating
disorders, psychotic disorders, sleep disorders, and substance-related
disorders, whereas individuals with anxiety disorders are more likely to
avoid caffeine.

Caffeine Withdrawal

Diagnostic Criteria

**292.0 (F15.93)**

A. Prolonged daily use of caffeine.

B. Abrupt cessation of or reduction in caffeine use, followed within 24
hours by three (or more) of the following signs or symptoms:

1\. Headache.

2\. Marked fatigue or drowsiness.

3\. Dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability.

4\. Difficulty concentrating.

5\. Flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or muscle pain/stiffness).

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

D. The signs or symptoms are not associated with the physiological
effects of another medical condition (e.g., migraine, viral illness) and
are not better explained by another mental disorder, including
intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of caffeine withdrawal is the presence of a
characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the abrupt
cessation of (or substantial reduction in) prolonged daily caffeine
ingestion (Criterion B). The caffeine withdrawal syndrome is indicated
by three or more of the following (Criterion B): headache; marked
fatigue or drowsiness; dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability;
difficulty concentrating; and flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or
muscle pain/stiffness). The withdrawal syndrome causes clinical
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be
associated with the physiological effects of another medical condition
and are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D).

Headache is the hallmark feature of caffeine withdrawal and may be
diffuse, gradual in development, throbbing, severe, and sensitive to
movement. However, other symptoms of caffeine withdrawal can occur in
the absence of headache. Caffeine is the most widely used behaviorally
active drug in the world and is present in many different types of
beverages (e.g., coffee, tea, maté, soft drinks, energy drinks), foods,
energy aids, medications, and dietary supplements. Because caffeine
ingestion is often integrated into social customs and daily rituals
(e.g., coffee break, tea time), some caffeine consumers may be unaware
of their physical dependence on caffeine. Thus, caffeine withdrawal
symptoms could be unexpected and misattributed to other causes (e.g.,
the flu, migraine). Furthermore, caffeine withdrawal symptoms may occur
when individuals are required to abstain from foods and beverages prior
to medical procedures or when a usual caffeine dose is missed because of
a change in routine (e.g., during travel, weekends).

[]{#index_split_065.html#p552}Caffeine Withdrawal

**507**

The probability and severity of caffeine withdrawal generally increase
as a function of usual daily caffeine dose. However, there is large
variability among individuals and within individuals across different
episodes in the incidence, severity, and time course of withdrawal
symptoms. Caffeine withdrawal symptoms may occur after abrupt cessation
of relatively low chronic daily doses of caffeine (i.e., 100 mg).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Caffeine abstinence has been shown to be associated with impaired
behavioral and cognitive performance (e.g., sustained attention).
Electroencephalographic studies have shown that caffeine withdrawal
symptoms are significantly associated with increases in theta power and
decreases in beta-2 power. Decreased motivation to work and decreased
sociability have also been reported during caffeine withdrawal.
Increased analgesic use during caffeine withdrawal has been documented.

Prevalence

More than 85% of adults and children in the United States regularly
consume caffeine, with adult caffeine consumers ingesting about 280
mg/day on average. The incidence and prevalence of the caffeine
withdrawal syndrome in the general population are unclear. In the United
States, headache may occur in approximately 50% of cases of caffeine
abstinence. In attempts to permanently stop caffeine use, more than 70%
of individuals may experience at least one caffeine withdrawal symptom
(47% may experience headache), and 24% may experience headache plus one
or more other symptoms as well as functional impairment due to
withdrawal. Among individuals who abstain from caffeine for at least 24
hours but are not trying to permanently stop caffeine use, 11% may
experience headache plus one or more other symptoms as well as
functional impairment. Caffeine consumers can decrease the incidence of
caffeine withdrawal by using caffeine daily or only infrequently (e.g.,
no more than 2 consecutive days). Gradual reduction in caffeine over a
period of days or weeks may decrease the incidence and severity of
caffeine withdrawal.

Development and Course

Symptoms usually begin 12--24 hours after the last caffeine dose and
peak after 1--2 days of abstinence. Caffeine withdrawal symptoms last
for 2--9 days, with the possibility of withdrawal headaches occurring
for up to 21 days. Symptoms usually remit rapidly (within 30--60
minutes) after re-ingestion of caffeine.

Caffeine is unique in that it is a behaviorally active drug that is
consumed by individuals of nearly all ages. Rates of caffeine
consumption and overall level of caffeine consumption increase with age
until the early to mid-30s and then level off. Although caffeine
withdrawal among children and adolescents has been documented,
relatively little is known about risk factors for caffeine withdrawal
among this age group. The use of highly caffeinated energy drinks is
increasing with in young individuals, which could increase the risk for
caffeine withdrawal.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Heavy caffeine use has been observed among individuals with mental
disorders, including eating disorders; smokers; prisoners; and drug and
alcohol abusers.

Thus, these individuals could be at higher risk for caffeine withdrawal
upon acute caffeine abstinence.

Environmental.

The unavailability of caffeine is an environmental risk factor for
incipient withdrawal symptoms. While caffeine is legal and usually
widely available, there are conditions in which caffeine use may be
restricted, such as during medical procedures, pregnancy,
hospitalizations, religious observances, wartime, travel, and research
partici-

[]{#index_split_065.html#p553}**508**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

pation. These external environmental circumstances may precipitate a
withdrawal syndrome in vulnerable individuals.

Genetic and physiological factors.

Genetic factors appear to increase vulnerability to

caffeine withdrawal, but no specific genes have been identified.

Course modifiers.

Caffeine withdrawal symptoms usually remit within 30--60 minutes of
reexposure to caffeine. Doses of caffeine significantly less than one's
usual daily dose may be sufficient to prevent or attenuate caffeine
withdrawal symptoms (e.g., consumption of 25 mg by an individual who
typically consumes 300 mg).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Habitual caffeine consumers who fast for religious reasons may be at
increased risk for caffeine withdrawal.

Functional Consequences of

Caffeine Withdrawal Disorder

Caffeine withdrawal symptoms can vary from mild to extreme, at times
causing functional impairment in normal daily activities. Rates of
functional impairment range from 10% to 55% (median 13%), with rates as
high as 73% found among individuals who also show other problematic
features of caffeine use. Examples of functional impairment include
being unable to work, exercise, or care for children; staying in bed all
day; missing religious services; ending a vacation early; and cancelling
a social gathering. Caffeine withdrawal headaches may be described by
individuals as "the worst headaches" ever experienced.

Decrements in cognitive and motor performance have also been observed.

Differential Diagnosis

Other medical disorders and medical side effects.

Several disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
caffeine withdrawal. Caffeine withdrawal can mimic migraine and other
headache disorders, viral illnesses, sinus conditions, tension, other
drug withdrawal states (e.g., from amphetamines, cocaine), and
medication side effects.

The final determination of caffeine withdrawal should rest on a
determination of the pattern and amount consumed, the time interval
between caffeine abstinence and onset of symptoms, and the particular
clinical features presented by the individual. A challenge dose of
caffeine followed by symptom remission may be used to confirm the
diagnosis.

Comorbidity

Caffeine withdrawal may be associated with major depressive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, antisocial personality
disorder in adults, moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, and
cannabis and cocaine use.

**Other Caffeine-Induced Disorders**

The following caffeine-induced disorders are described in other chapters
of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see
the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
caffeine-induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety Disorders") and
caffeine-induced sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"). These
caffeine-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of caffeine
intoxication or caffeine withdrawal only when the symptoms are
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p554}Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder
**509**

Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder

**292.9 (F15.99)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a caffeine-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific caffeine-related disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

**Cannabis-Related Disorders**

**Cannabis Use Disorder**

**Cannabis Intoxication**

**Cannabis Withdrawal**

**Other Cannabis-Induced Disorders**

**Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder**

Cannabis Use Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. A problematic pattern of cannabis use leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period: 1. Cannabis is often
taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.

2\. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control cannabis use.

3\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain
cannabis, use cannabis, or recover from its effects.

4\. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis.

5\. Recurrent cannabis use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home.

6\. Continued cannabis use despite having persistent or recurrent social
or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of
cannabis.

7\. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of cannabis use.

8\. Recurrent cannabis use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous.

9\. Cannabis use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent
or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have
been caused or exacerbated by cannabis.

10\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of cannabis to achieve intoxication or
desired effect.

b\. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of
cannabis.

11\. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The
characteristic withdrawal syndrome for cannabis (refer to Criteria A and
B

of the criteria set for cannabis withdrawal, pp. 517--518).

[]{#index_split_065.html#p555}**510**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

b\. Cannabis (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or
avoid withdrawal symptoms.

*Specify* if:

**In early remission:** After full criteria for cannabis use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for cannabis use disorder have
been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
cannabis," may be met).

**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for cannabis use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for cannabis use
disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use cannabis," may be present).

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to cannabis is
restricted.

**Code based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a
cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or another cannabis-induced
mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for cannabis
use disorder. Instead, the comorbid cannabis use disorder is indicated
in the 4th character of the cannabis-induced disorder code (see the
coding note for cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or a
specific cannabis-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is
comorbid cannabis-induced anxiety disorder and cannabis use disorder,
only the cannabis-induced anxiety disorder code is given, with the 4th
character indicating whether the comorbid cannabis use disorder is mild,
moderate, or severe: F12.180 for mild cannabis use disorder with
cannabis-induced anxiety disorder or F12.280

for a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder with cannabis-induced
anxiety disorder.

*Specify* current severity:

**305.20 (F12.10) Mild:** Presence of 2--3 symptoms.

**304.30 (F12.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4--5 symptoms.

**304.30 (F12.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers

"In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier of
remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Changing severity across time in an individual may also be reflected by
changes in the frequency (e.g., days of use per month or times used per
day) and/or dose (e.g., amount used per episode) of cannabis, as
assessed by individual self-report, report of knowledgeable others,
clinician's observations, and biological testing.

Diagnostic Features

Cannabis use disorder and the other cannabis-related disorders include
problems that are associated with substances derived from the cannabis
plant and chemically similar synthetic compounds. Over time, this plant
material has accumulated many names (e.g., weed, pot, herb, grass,
reefer, mary jane, dagga, dope, bhang, skunk, boom, gangster, kif, and
ganja). A concentrated extraction of the cannabis plant that is also
commonly used is hashish. *Cannabis* is the generic and perhaps the most
appropriate scientific term for the psychoactive substance(s) derived
from the plant, and as such it is used in this manual to refer to all
forms of cannabis-like substances, including synthetic cannabinoid
compounds.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p556}Cannabis Use Disorder

**511**

Synthetic oral formulations (pill/capsules) of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) are available by prescription
for a number of approved medical indications (e.g., for nausea and
vomiting caused by chemotherapy; for anorexia and weight loss in
individuals with AIDS). Other synthetic cannabinoid compounds have been
manufactured and distributed for nonmedical use in the form of plant
material that has been sprayed with a cannabinoid formulation (e.g., K2,
Spice, JWH-018, JWH-073).

The cannabinoids have diverse effects in the brain, prominent among
which are actions on CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors that are found
throughout the central nervous system. Endogenous ligands for these
receptors behave essentially like neurotransmitters.

The potency of cannabis (delta-9-THC concentration) that is generally
available varies greatly, ranging from 1% to approximately 15% in
typical cannabis plant material and 10%--20% in hashish. During the past
two decades, a steady increase in the potency of seized cannabis has
been observed.

Cannabis is most commonly smoked via a variety of methods: pipes, water
pipes (bongs or hookahs), cigarettes (joints or reefers), or, most
recently, in the paper from hollowed out cigars (blunts). Cannabis is
also sometimes ingested orally, typically by mixing it into food. More
recently, devices have been developed in which cannabis is "vaporized."
Vaporization involves heating the plant material to release psychoactive
cannabinoids for inhalation. As with other psychoactive substances,
smoking (and vaporization) typically produces more rapid onset and more
intense experiences of the desired effects.

Individuals who regularly use cannabis can develop all the general
diagnostic features of a substance use disorder. Cannabis use disorder
is commonly observed as the only substance use disorder experienced by
the individual; however, it also frequently occurs concurrently with
other types of substance use disorders (i.e., alcohol, cocaine, opioid).
In cases for which multiple types of substances are used, many times the
individual may minimize the symptoms related to cannabis, as the
symptoms may be less severe or cause less harm than those directly
related to the use of the other substances. Pharmacological and
behavioral tolerance to most of the effects of cannabis has been
reported in individuals who use cannabis persistently. Generally,
tolerance is lost when cannabis use is discontinued for a significant
period of time (i.e., for at least several months).

New to DSM-5 is the recognition that abrupt cessation of daily or
near-daily cannabis use often results in the onset of a cannabis
withdrawal syndrome. Common symptoms of withdrawal include irritability,
anger or aggression, anxiety, depressed mood, restlessness, sleep
difficulty, and decreased appetite or weight loss. Although typically
not as severe as alcohol or opiate withdrawal, the cannabis withdrawal
syndrome can cause significant distress and contribute to difficulty
quitting or relapse among those trying to abstain.

Individuals with cannabis use disorder may use cannabis throughout the
day over a period of months or years, and thus may spend many hours a
day under the influence.

Others may use less frequently, but their use causes recurrent problems
related to family, school, work, or other important activities (e.g.,
repeated absences at work; neglect of family obligations). Periodic
cannabis use and intoxication can negatively affect behavioral and
cognitive functioning and thus interfere with optimal performance at
work or school, or place the individual at increased physical risk when
performing activities that could be physically hazardous (e.g., driving
a car; playing certain sports; performing manual work activities,
including operating machinery). Arguments with spouses or parents over
the use of cannabis in the home, or its use in the presence of children,
can adversely impact family functioning and are common features of those
with cannabis use disorder. Last, individuals with cannabis use disorder
may continue using despite knowledge of physical problems (e.g., chronic
cough related to smoking) or psychological problems (e.g., excessive
sedation or exacerbation of other mental health problems) associated
with its use.

Whether or not cannabis is being used for legitimate medical reasons may
also affect diagnosis. When a substance is taken as indicated for a
medical condition, symptoms of

[]{#index_split_065.html#p557}**512**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

tolerance and withdrawal will naturally occur and should not be used as
the primary criteria for determining a diagnosis of a substance use
disorder. Although medical uses of cannabis remain controversial and
equivocal, use for medical circumstances should be considered when a
diagnosis is being made.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals who regularly use cannabis often report that it is being
used to cope with mood, sleep, pain, or other physiological or
psychological problems, and those diagnosed with cannabis use disorder
frequently do have concurrent other mental disorders. Careful assessment
typically reveals reports of cannabis use contributing to exacerbation
of these same symptoms, as well as other reasons for frequent use (e.g.,
to experience euphoria, to forget about problems, in response to anger,
as an enjoyable social activity). Related to this issue, some
individuals who use cannabis multiple times per day for the
aforementioned reasons do not perceive themselves as (and thus do not
report) spending an excessive amount of time under the influence or
recovering from the effects of cannabis, despite being intoxicated on
cannabis or coming down from it effects for the majority of most days.

An important marker of a substance use disorder diagnosis, particularly
in milder cases, is continued use despite a clear risk of negative
consequences to other valued activities or relationships (e.g., school,
work, sport activity, partner or parent relationship).

Because some cannabis users are motivated to minimize their amount or
frequency of use, it is important to be aware of common signs and
symptoms of cannabis use and intoxication so as to better assess the
extent of use. As with other substances, experienced users of cannabis
develop behavioral and pharmacological tolerance such that it can be
difficult to detect when they are under the influence. Signs of acute
and chronic use include red eyes (conjunctival injection), cannabis odor
on clothing, yellowing of finger tips (from smoking joints), chronic
cough, burning of incense (to hide the odor), and exaggerated craving
and impulse for specific foods, sometimes at unusual times of the day or
night.

Prevalence

Cannabinoids, especially cannabis, are the most widely used illicit
psychoactive substances in the United States. The 12-month prevalence of
cannabis use disorder (DSM-IV

abuse and dependence rates combined) is approximately 3.4% among 12-to
17-year-olds and 1.5% among adults age 18 years and older. Rates of
cannabis use disorder are greater among adult males (2.2%) than among
adult females (0.8%) and among 12-to 17-year-old males (3.8%) than among
12-to 17-year-old females (3.0%). Twelve-month prevalence rates of
cannabis use disorder among adults decrease with age, with rates highest
among 18-to 29-year-olds (4.4%) and lowest among individuals age 65
years and older (0.01%).

The high prevalence of cannabis use disorder likely reflects the much
more widespread use of cannabis relative to other illicit drugs rather
than greater addictive potential.

Ethnic and racial differences in prevalence are moderate. Twelve-month
prevalences of cannabis use disorder vary markedly across racial-ethnic
subgroups in the United States. For 12-to 17-year-olds, rates are
highest among Native American and Alaska Natives (7.1%) compared with
Hispanics (4.1%), whites (3.4%), African Americans (2.7%), and Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.9%). Among adults, the prevalence of
cannabis use disorder is also highest among Native Americans and Alaska
Natives (3.4%) relative to rates among African Americans (1.8%), whites
(1.4%), Hispanics (1.2%), and Asian and Pacific Islanders (1.2%). During
the past decade the prevalence of cannabis use disorder has increased
among adults and adolescents. Gender differences in cannabis use
disorder generally are concordant with those in other substance use
disorders. Cannabis use disorder is more commonly observed in males,
although the magnitude of this difference is less among adolescents.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p558}Cannabis Use Disorder

**513**

Development and Course

The onset of cannabis use disorder can occur at any time during or
following adolescence, but onset is most commonly during adolescence or
young adulthood. Although much less frequent, onset of cannabis use
disorder in the preteen years or in the late 20s or older can occur.
Recent acceptance by some of the use and availability of "medical
marijuana" may increase the rate of onset of cannabis use disorder among
older adults.

Generally, cannabis use disorder develops over an extended period of
time, although the progression appears to be more rapid in adolescents,
particularly those with pervasive conduct problems. Most people who
develop a cannabis use disorder typically establish a pattern of
cannabis use that gradually increases in both frequency and amount.
Cannabis, along with tobacco and alcohol, is traditionally the first
substance that adolescents try.

Many perceive cannabis use as less harmful than alcohol or tobacco use,
and this perception likely contributes to increased use. Moreover,
cannabis intoxication does not typically result in as severe behavioral
and cognitive dysfunction as does significant alcohol intoxication,
which may increase the probability of more frequent use in more diverse
situations than with alcohol. These factors likely contribute to the
potential rapid transition from cannabis use to a cannabis use disorder
among some adolescents and the common pattern of using throughout the
day that is commonly observed among those with more severe cannabis use
disorder.

Cannabis use disorder among preteens, adolescents, and young adults is
typically expressed as excessive use with peers that is a component of a
pattern of other delinquent behaviors usually associated with conduct
problems. Milder cases primarily reflect continued use despite clear
problems related to disapproval of use by other peers, school
administration, or family, which also places the youth at risk for
physical or behavioral consequences. In more severe cases, there is a
progression to using alone or using throughout the day such that use
interferes with daily functioning and takes the place of previously
established, prosocial activities.

With adolescent users, changes in mood stability, energy level, and
eating patterns are commonly observed. These signs and symptoms are
likely due to the direct effects of cannabis use (intoxication) and the
subsequent effects following acute intoxication (coming down), as well
as attempts to conceal use from others. School-related problems are
commonly associated with cannabis use disorder in adolescents,
particularly a dramatic drop in grades, truancy, and reduced interest in
general school activities and outcomes.

Cannabis use disorder among adults typically involves well-established
patterns of daily cannabis use that continue despite clear psychosocial
or medical problems. Many adults have experienced repeated desire to
stop or have failed at repeated cessation attempts. Milder adult cases
may resemble the more common adolescent cases in that cannabis use is
not as frequent or heavy but continues despite potential significant
consequences of sustained use. The rate of use among middle-age and
older adults appears to be increasing, likely because of a cohort effect
resulting from high prevalence of use in the late 1960s and the 1970s.

Early onset of cannabis use (e.g., prior to age 15 years) is a robust
predictor of the development of cannabis use disorder and other types of
substance use disorders and mental disorders during young adulthood.
Such early onset is likely related to concurrent other externalizing
problems, most notably conduct disorder symptoms. However, early onset
is also a predictor of internalizing problems and as such probably
reflects a general risk factor for the development of mental health
disorders.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

A history of conduct disorder in childhood or adolescence and antisocial
personality disorder are risk factors for the development of many
substance-related disorders, including cannabis-related disorders. Other
risk factors include externalizing

[]{#index_split_065.html#p559}**514**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

or internalizing disorders during childhood or adolescence. Youths with
high behavioral disinhibition scores show early-onset substance use
disorders, including cannabis use disorder, multiple substance
involvement, and early conduct problems.

Environmental.

Risk factors include academic failure, tobacco smoking, unstable or
abusive family situation, use of cannabis among immediate family
members, a family history of a substance use disorder, and low
socioeconomic status. As with all substances of abuse, the ease of
availability of the substance is a risk factor; cannabis is relatively
easy to obtain in most cultures, which increases the risk of developing
a cannabis use disorder.

Genetic and physiological.

Genetic influences contribute to the development of cannabis use
disorders. Heritable factors contribute between 30% and 80% of the total
variance in risk of cannabis use disorders. It should be noted that
common genetic and shared environmental influences between cannabis and
other types of substance use disorders suggest a common genetic basis
for adolescent substance use and conduct problems.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Cannabis is probably the world's most commonly used illicit substance.
Occurrence of cannabis use disorder across countries is unknown, but the
prevalence rates are likely similar among developed countries. It is
frequently among the first drugs of experimentation (often in the teens)
of all cultural groups in the United States.

Acceptance of cannabis for medical purposes varies widely across and
within cultures.

Cultural factors (acceptability and legal status) that might impact
diagnosis relate to differential consequences across cultures for
detection of use (i.e., arrest, school suspensions, or employment
suspension). The general change in substance use disorder diagnostic
criteria from DSM-IV to DSM-5 (i.e., removal of the recurrent
substance-related legal problems criterion) mitigates this concern to
some degree.

Diagnostic Markers

Biological tests for cannabinoid metabolites are useful for determining
if an individual has recently used cannabis. Such testing is helpful in
making a diagnosis, particularly in milder cases if an individual denies
using while others (family, work, school) purport concern about a
substance use problem. Because cannabinoids are fat soluble, they
persist in bodily fluids for extended periods of time and are excreted
slowly. Expertise in urine testing methods is needed to reliably
interpret results.

Functional Consequences of Cannabis Use Disorder

Functional consequences of cannabis use disorder are part of the
diagnostic criteria. Many areas of psychosocial, cognitive, and health
functioning may be compromised in relation to cannabis use disorder.
Cognitive function, particularly higher executive function, appears to
be compromised in cannabis users, and this relationship appears to be
dose dependent (both acutely and chronically). This may contribute to
increased difficulty at school or work. Cannabis use has been related to
a reduction in prosocial goal-directed activity, which some have labeled
an *amotivational syndrome,* that manifests itself in poor school
performance and employment problems. These problems may be related to
pervasive intoxication or recovery from the effects of intoxication.
Similarly, cannabis-associated problems with social relationships are
commonly reported in those with cannabis use disorder. Accidents due to
engagement in potentially dangerous behaviors while under the influence
(e.g., driving, sport, recreational or employment activities) are also
of concern.

Cannabis smoke contains high levels of carcinogenic compounds that place
chronic users at risk for respiratory illnesses similar to those
experienced by tobacco smokers. Chronic cannabis use may contribute to
the onset or exacerbation of many other mental disorders.

In particular, concern has been raised about cannabis use as a causal
factor in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Cannabis use can
contribute to the onset of an acute psy-

**515**

chotic episode, can exacerbate some symptoms, and can adversely affect
treatment of a major psychotic illness.

Differential Diagnosis

Nonproblematic use of cannabis.

The distinction between nonproblematic use of cannabis and cannabis use
disorder can be difficult to make because social, behavioral, or
psychological problems may be difficult to attribute to the substance,
especially in the context of use of other substances. Also, denial of
heavy cannabis use and the attribution that cannabis is related to or
causing substantial problems are common among individuals who are
referred to treatment by others (i.e., school, family, employer,
criminal justice system).

Other mental disorders.

Cannabis-induced disorder may be characterized by symptoms (e.g.,
anxiety) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., generalized
anxiety disorder vs. cannabis-induced anxiety disorder, with generalized
anxiety, with onset during intoxication). Chronic intake of cannabis can
produce a lack of motivation that resembles persistent depressive
disorder (dysthymia). Acute adverse reactions to cannabis should be
differentiated from the symptoms of panic disorder, major depressive
disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia,
paranoid type. Physical examination will usually show an increased pulse
and conjunctival injection. Urine toxicological testing can be helpful
in making a diagnosis.

Comorbidity

Cannabis has been commonly thought of as a "gateway" drug because
individuals who frequently use cannabis have a much greater lifetime
probability than nonusers of using what are commonly considered more
dangerous substances, like opioids or cocaine. Cannabis use and cannabis
use disorder are highly comorbid with other substance use disorders.
Co-occurring mental conditions are common in cannabis use disorder.
Cannabis use has been associated with poorer life satisfaction;
increased mental health treatment and hospitalization; and higher rates
of depression, anxiety disorders, suicide attempts, and conduct
disorder. Individuals with past-year or lifetime cannabis use disorder
have high rates of alcohol use disorder (greater than 50%) and tobacco
use disorder (53%). Rates of other substance use disorders are also
likely to be high among individuals with cannabis use disorder. Among
those seeking treatment for a cannabis use disorder, 74% report
problematic use of a secondary or tertiary substance: alcohol (40%),
cocaine (12%), methamphetamine (6%), and heroin or other opiates (2%).
Among those younger than 18 years, 61% reported problematic use of a
secondary substance: alcohol (48%), cocaine (4%), methamphetamine (2%),
and heroin or other opiates (2%). Cannabis use disorder is also often
observed as a secondary problem among those with a primary diagnosis of
other substance use disorders, with approximately 25%--80% of those in
treatment for another substance use disorder reporting use of cannabis.

Individuals with past-year or lifetime diagnoses of cannabis use
disorder also have high rates of concurrent mental disorders other than
substance use disorders. Major depressive disorder (11%), any anxiety
disorder (24%), and bipolar I disorder (13%) are quite common among
individuals with a past-year diagnosis of a cannabis use disorder, as
are antisocial (30%), obsessive-compulsive, (19%), and paranoid (18%)
personality disorders.

Approximately 33% of adolescents with cannabis use disorder have
internalizing disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress
disorder), and 60% have externalizing disorders (e.g., conduct disorder,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).

Although cannabis use can impact multiple aspects of normal human
functioning, including the cardiovascular, immune, neuromuscular,
ocular, reproductive, and respiratory systems, as well as appetite and
cognition/perception, there are few clear medical conditions that
commonly co-occur with cannabis use disorder. The most significant
health

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

effects of cannabis involve the respiratory system, and chronic cannabis
smokers exhibit high rates of respiratory symptoms of bronchitis, sputum
production, shortness of breath, and wheezing.

Cannabis Intoxication

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Recent use of cannabis.

B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., impaired motor coordination, euphoria, anxiety, sensation
of slowed time, impaired judgment, social withdrawal) that developed
during, or shortly after, cannabis use.

C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing within 2
hours of cannabis use:

1\. Conjunctival injection.

2\. Increased appetite.

3\. Dry mouth.

4\. Tachycardia.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance.

*Specify* if:

**With perceptual disturbances:** Hallucinations with intact reality
testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence
of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether or not there is a comorbid cannabis use disorder and
whether or not there are perceptual disturbances.

**For cannabis intoxication, without perceptual disturbances:** If a
mild cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
**F12.129,** and if a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F12.229.** If there is no comorbid
cannabis use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F12.929.**

**For cannabis intoxication, with perceptual disturbances:** If a mild
cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F12.122,**
and if a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the
ICD-10-CM code is **F12.222.** If there is no comorbid cannabis use
disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F12.922.**

Specifiers

When hallucinations occur in the absence of intact reality testing, a
diagnosis of substance/

medication-induced psychotic disorder should be considered.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of cannabis intoxication is the presence of
clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes
that develop during, or shortly after, cannabis use (Criterion B).
Intoxication typically begins with a "high" feeling followed by symptoms
that include euphoria with inappropriate laughter and grandiosity,
sedation, lethargy, impairment in short-term memory, difficulty carrying
out complex mental processes, impaired judgment, distorted sensory
perceptions, impaired motor performance, and the sensation that time is
passing slowly. Occasionally, anxiety (which can be severe),
[]{#index_split_065.html#p562}Cannabis Withdrawal

**517**

dysphoria, or social withdrawal occurs. These psychoactive effects are
accompanied by two or more of the following signs, developing within 2
hours of cannabis use: conjunctival injection, increased appetite, dry
mouth, and tachycardia (Criterion C).

Intoxication develops within minutes if the cannabis is smoked but may
take a few hours to develop if the cannabis is ingested orally. The
effects usually last 3--4 hours, with the duration being somewhat longer
when the substance is ingested orally. The magnitude of the behavioral
and physiological changes depends on the dose, the method of
administration, and the characteristics of the individual using the
substance, such as rate of absorption, tolerance, and sensitivity to the
effects of the substance. Because most cannabinoids, including
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), are fat soluble, the effects
of cannabis or hashish may occasionally persist or reoccur for 12--24
hours because of the slow release of psychoactive substances from fatty
tissue or to enterohepatic circulation.

Prevalence

The prevalence of actual episodes of cannabis intoxication in the
general population is unknown. However, it is probable that most
cannabis users would at some time meet criteria for cannabis
intoxication. Given this, the prevalence of cannabis users and the
prevalence of individuals experiencing cannabis intoxication are likely
similar.

Functional Consequences of Cannabis Intoxication

Impairment from cannabis intoxication may have serious consequences,
including dysfunction at work or school, social indiscretions, failure
to fulfill role obligations, traffic accidents, and having unprotected
sex. In rare cases, cannabis intoxication may precipitate a psychosis
that may vary in duration.

Differential Diagnosis

Note that if the clinical presentation includes hallucinations in the
absence of intact reality testing, a diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be considered.

Other substance intoxication.

Cannabis intoxication may resemble intoxication with

other types of substances. However, in contrast to cannabis
intoxication, alcohol intoxication and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
intoxication frequently decrease appetite, increase aggressive behavior,
and produce nystagmus or ataxia. Hallucinogens in low doses may cause a
clinical picture that resembles cannabis intoxication. Phencyclidine,
like cannabis, can be smoked and also causes perceptual changes, but
phencyclidine intoxication is much more likely to cause ataxia and
aggressive behavior.

Other cannabis-induced disorders.

Cannabis intoxication is distinguished from the other cannabis-induced
disorders (e.g., cannabis-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during
intoxication) because the symptoms in these latter disorders predominate
the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent
clinical attention.

Cannabis Withdrawal

Diagnostic Criteria

**292.0 (F12.288)**

A. Cessation of cannabis use that has been heavy and prolonged (i.e.,
usually daily or almost daily use over a period of at least a few
months).

B. Three (or more) of the following signs and symptoms develop within
approximately 1 week after Criterion A:

[]{#index_split_065.html#p563}**518**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

1\. Irritability, anger, or aggression.

2\. Nervousness or anxiety.

3\. Sleep difficulty (e.g., insomnia, disturbing dreams).

4\. Decreased appetite or weight loss.

5\. Restlessness.

6\. Depressed mood.

7\. At least one of the following physical symptoms causing significant
discomfort: abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors, sweating, fever, chills,
or headache.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for
cannabis withdrawal is F12.288. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates
the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder,
reflecting the fact that cannabis withdrawal can only occur in the
presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder. It is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild cannabis use disorder with cannabis
withdrawal.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of cannabis withdrawal is the presence of a
characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the cessation of
or substantial reduction in heavy and prolonged cannabis use. In
addition to the symptoms in Criterion B, the following may also be
observed postabstinence: fatigue, yawning, difficulty concentrating, and
rebound periods of increased appetite and hypersomnia that follow
initial periods of loss of appetite and insomnia. For the diagnosis,
withdrawal symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning (Criterion C). Many cannabis users report smoking cannabis
or taking other substances to help relieve withdrawal symptoms, and many
report that withdrawal symptoms make quitting difficult or have
contributed to relapse. The symptoms typically are not of sufficient
severity to require medical attention, but medication or behavioral
strategies may help alleviate symptoms and improve prognosis in those
trying to quit using cannabis.

Cannabis withdrawal is commonly observed in individuals seeking
treatment for cannabis use as well as in heavy cannabis users who are
not seeking treatment. Among individuals who have used cannabis
regularly during some period of their lifetime, up to one-third report
having experienced cannabis withdrawal. Among adults and adolescents
enrolled in treatment or heavy cannabis users, 50%--95% report cannabis
withdrawal. These findings indicate that cannabis withdrawal occurs
among a substantial subset of regular cannabis users who try to quit.

Development and Course

The amount, duration, and frequency of cannabis smoking that is required
to produce an associated withdrawal disorder during a quit attempt are
unknown. Most symptoms have their onset within the first 24--72 hours of
cessation, peak within the first week, and last approximately 1--2
weeks. Sleep difficulties may last more than 30 days. Cannabis
withdrawal has been documented among adolescents and adults. Withdrawal
tends to be more common and severe among adults, most likely related to
the more persistent and greater frequency and quantity of use among
adults.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p564}Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder
**519**

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Most likely, the prevalence and severity of cannabis withdrawal are
greater among heavier cannabis users, and particularly among those
seeking treatment for cannabis use disorders. Withdrawal severity also
appears to be positively related to the severity of comorbid symptoms of
mental disorders.

Functional Consequences of Cannabis Withdrawal

Cannabis users report using cannabis to relieve withdrawal symptoms,
suggesting that withdrawal might contribute to ongoing expression of
cannabis use disorder. Worse outcomes may be associated with greater
withdrawal. A substantial proportion of adults and adolescents in
treatment for moderate to severe cannabis use disorder acknowledge
moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms, and many complain that these
symptoms make cessation more difficult. Cannabis users report having
relapsed to cannabis use or initiating use of other drugs (e.g.,
tranquilizers) to provide relief from cannabis withdrawal symptoms.
Last, individuals living with cannabis users observe significant
withdrawal effects, suggesting that such symptoms are disruptive to
daily living.

Differential Diagnosis

Because many of the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal are also symptoms of
other substance withdrawal syndromes or of depressive or bipolar
disorders, careful evaluation should focus on ensuring that the symptoms
are not better explained by cessation from another substance (e.g.,
tobacco or alcohol withdrawal), another mental disorder (generalized
anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder), or another medical
condition.

**Other Cannabis-Induced Disorders**

The following cannabis-induced disorders are described in other chapters
of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see
the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
cannabis-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other
Psychotic Disorders"); cannabis-induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety
Disorders"); and cannabis-induced sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake
Disorders"). For cannabis intoxication delirium, see the criteria and
discussion of delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders." These
cannabis-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of cannabis
intoxication or cannabis withdrawal when the symptoms are sufficiently
severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder

**292.9 (F12.99)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a cannabis-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific cannabis-related disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Phencyclidine Use Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. A pattern of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar substance)
use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as
manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1\. Phencyclidine is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer
period than was intended.

2\. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control phencyclidine use.

3\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain
phencyclidine, use the phencyclidine, or recover from its effects.

4\. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use phencyclidine.

5\. Recurrent phencyclidine use resulting in a failure to fulfill major
role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from
work or poor work performance related to phencyclidine use;
phencyclidine-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school;
neglect of children or household).

6\. Continued phencyclidine use despite having persistent or recurrent
social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of
the phencyclidine (e.g., arguments with a spouse about consequences of
intoxication; physical fights).

7\. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of phencyclidine use.

8\. Recurrent phencyclidine use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when
impaired by a phencyclidine).

9\. Phencyclidine use is continued despite knowledge of having a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely
to have been caused or exacerbated by the phencyclidine.

10\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of the phencyclidine to achieve intoxication
or desired effect.

b\. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount
of the phencyclidine.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p566}Phencyclidine Use Disorder

**521**

**Note:** Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established for
phencyclidines, and so this criterion does not apply. (Withdrawal from
phencyclidines has been reported in animals but not documented in human
users.)

*Specify* if:

**In early remission:** After full criteria for phencyclidine use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine use
disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months
(with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or
urge to use the phencyclidine," may be met).

**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for phencyclidine use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine use
disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use the phencyclidine," may be met).

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to phencyclidines is
restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a
phencyclidine intoxication or another phencyclidine-induced mental
disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for phencyclidine
use disorder. Instead, the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is
indicated in the 4th character of the phencyclidine-induced disorder
code (see the coding note for phencyclidine intoxication or a specific
phencyclidine-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is
comorbid phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, only the
phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder code is given, with the 4th
character indicating whether the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is
mild, moderate, or severe: F16.159 for mild phencyclidine use disorder
with phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder or F16.259 for a moderate
or severe phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced
psychotic disorder.

*Specify* current severity:

**305.90 (F16.10) Mild:** Presence of 2--3 symptoms.

**304.60 (F16.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4--5 symptoms.

**304.60 (F16.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers

"In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier of
remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Diagnostic Features

The phencyclidines (or phencyclidine-like substances) include
phencyclidine (e.g., PCP,

"angel dust") and less potent but similarly acting compounds such as
ketamine, cyclohex-amine, and dizocilpine. These substances were first
developed as dissociative anesthetics in the 1950s and became street
drugs in the 1960s. They produce feelings of separation from mind and
body (hence "dissociative") in low doses, and at high doses, stupor and
coma can result. These substances are most commonly smoked or taken
orally, but they may also be snorted or injected. Although the primary
psychoactive effects of PCP last for a few hours, the total elimination
rate of this drug from the body typically extends 8 days or longer. The
hallucinogenic effects in vulnerable individuals may last for weeks and
may precipitate a persistent psychotic episode resembling schizophrenia.
Ketamine has been observed to have utility in the treatment of major
depressive disorder. Withdrawal symp-

[]{#index_split_065.html#p567}**522**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

toms have not been clearly established in humans, and therefore the
withdrawal criterion is not included in the diagnosis of phencyclidine
use disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Phencyclidine may be detected in urine for up to 8 days or even longer
at very high doses. In addition to laboratory tests to detect its
presence, characteristic symptoms resulting from intoxication with
phencyclidine or related substances may aid in its diagnosis.
Phencyclidine is likely to produce dissociative symptoms, analgesia,
nystagmus, and hypertension, with risk of hypotension and shock. Violent
behavior can also occur with phencyclidine use, as intoxicated persons
may believe that they are being attacked. Residual symptoms following
use may resemble schizophrenia.

Prevalence

The prevalence of phencyclidine use disorder is unknown. Approximately
2.5% of the population reports having ever used phencyclidine. The
proportion of users increases with age, from 0.3% of 12-to 17-year-olds,
to 1.3% of 18-to 25-year-olds, to 2.9% of those age 26

years and older reporting ever using phencyclidine. There appears to
have been an increase among 12th graders in both ever used (to 2.3% from
1.8%) and past-year use (to 1.3%

from 1.0%) of phencyclidine. Past-year use of ketamine appears
relatively stable among 12th graders (1.6%--1.7% over the past 3 years).

Risk and Prognostic Factors

There is little information about risk factors for phencyclidine use
disorder. Among individuals admitted to substance abuse treatment, those
for whom phencyclidine was the primary substance were younger than those
admitted for other substance use, had lower educational levels, and were
more likely to be located in the West and Northeast regions of the
United States, compared with other admissions.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Ketamine use in youths ages 16--23 years has been reported to be more
common among whites (0.5%) than among other ethnic groups (range
0%--0.3%). Among individuals admitted to substance abuse treatment,
those for whom phencyclidine was the primary substance were
predominantly black (49%) or Hispanic (29%).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Males make up about three-quarters of those with phencyclidine-related
emergency room visits.

Diagnostic Markers

Laboratory testing may be useful, as phencyclidine is present in the
urine in intoxicated individuals up to 8 days after ingestion. The
individual's history, along with certain physical signs, such as
nystagmus, analgesia and prominent hypertension, may aid in
distinguishing the phencyclidine clinical picture from that of other
hallucinogens.

Functional Consequences of Phencyclidine Use Disorder In individuals
with phencyclidine use disorder, there may be physical evidence of
injuries from accidents, fights, and falls. Chronic use of phencyclidine
may lead to deficits in memory, speech, and cognition that may last for
months. Cardiovascular and neurological toxicities (e.g., seizures,
dystonias, dyskinesias, catalepsy, hypothermia or hyperthermia) may
result from intoxication with phencyclidine. Other consequences include
intracranial hemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory problems, and
(occasionally) cardiac arrest.

[]{#index_split_065.html#p568}Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder

**523**

Differential Diagnosis

Other substance use disorders.

Distinguishing the effects of phencyclidine from those of other
substances is important, since it may be a common additive to other
substances (e.g., cannabis, cocaine).

Schizophrenia and other mental disorders.

Some of the effects of phencyclidine and

related substance use may resemble symptoms of other psychiatric
disorders, such as psychosis (schizophrenia), low mood (major depressive
disorder), violent aggressive behaviors (conduct disorder, antisocial
personality disorder). Discerning whether these behaviors occurred
before the intake of the drug is important in the differentiation of
acute drug effects from preexisting mental disorder.
Phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder should be considered when there
is impaired reality testing in individuals experiencing disturbances in
perception resulting from ingestion of phencyclidine.

Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. A problematic pattern of hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine) use
leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested
by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:

1\. The hallucinogen is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer
period than was intended.

2\. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control hallucinogen use.

3\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the
hallucinogen, use the hallucinogen, or recover from its effects.

4\. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen.

5\. Recurrent hallucinogen use resulting in a failure to fulfill major
role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from
work or poor work performance related to hallucinogen use;
hallucinogen-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school;
neglect of children or household).

6\. Continued hallucinogen use despite having persistent or recurrent
social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of
the hallucinogen (e.g., arguments with a spouse about consequences of
intoxication; physical fights).

7\. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of hallucinogen use.

8\. Recurrent hallucinogen use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when
impaired by the hallucinogen).

9\. Hallucinogen use is continued despite knowledge of having a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely
to have been caused or exacerbated by the hallucinogen.

10\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of the hallucinogen to achieve intoxication
or desired effect.

b\. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount
of the hallucinogen.

**Note:** Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established for
hallucinogens, and so this criterion does not apply.

Specifiers

"In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier of
remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Diagnostic Features

Hallucinogens comprise a diverse group of substances that, despite
having different chemical structures and possibly involving different
molecular mechanisms, produce similar alterations of perception, mood,
and cognition in users. Hallucinogens included are phenyl-alkylamines
(e.g., mescaline, DOM \[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine\], and MDMA

\[3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; also called "ecstasy"\]); the
indoleamines, including psilocybin (i.e., psilocin) and
dimethyltryptamine (DMT); and the ergolines, such as LSD

(lysergic acid diethylamide) and morning glory seeds. In addition,
miscellaneous other ethnobotanical compounds are classified as
"hallucinogens," of which *Salvia divinorum* and jimsonweed are two
examples. Excluded from the hallucinogen group are cannabis and its
active compound, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (see the section
"Cannabis-Related Disorders"). These substances can have hallucinogenic
effects but are diagnosed separately because of significant differences
in their psychological and behavioral effects.

Hallucinogens are usually taken orally, although some forms are smoked
(e.g., DMT, salvia) or (rarely) taken intranasally or by injection
(e.g., ecstasy). Duration of effects varies

[]{#index_split_066.html#p570}Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder

**525**

across types of hallucinogens. Some of these substances (i.e., LSD,
MDMA) have a long half-life and extended duration such that users may
spend hours to days using and/or recovering from the effects of these
drugs. However, other hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., DMT, salvia) are short
acting. Tolerance to hallucinogens develops with repeated use and has
been reported to have both autonomic and psychological effects.
Cross-tolerance exists between LSD and other hallucinogens (e.g.,
psilocybin, mescaline) but does not extend to other drug categories such
as amphetamines and cannabis.

MDMA/ecstasy as a hallucinogen may have distinctive effects attributable
to both its hallucinogenic and its stimulant properties. Among heavy
ecstasy users, continued use despite physical or psychological problems,
tolerance, hazardous use, and spending a great deal of time obtaining
the substance are the most commonly reported criteria---over 50% in
adults and over 30% in a younger sample, while legal problems related to
substance use and persistent desire/inability to quit are rarely
reported. As found for other substances, diagnostic criteria for other
hallucinogen use disorder are arrayed along a single continuum of
severity.

One of the generic criteria for substance use disorders, a clinically
significant withdrawal syndrome, has not been consistently documented in
humans, and therefore the diagnosis of hallucinogen withdrawal syndrome
is not included in DSM-5. However, there is evidence of withdrawal from
MDMA, with endorsement of two or more withdrawal symptoms observed in
59%--98% in selected samples of ecstasy users. Both psychological and
physical problems have been commonly reported as withdrawal problems.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The characteristic symptom features of some of the hallucinogens can aid
in diagnosis if urine or blood toxicology results are not available. For
example, individuals who use LSD

tend to experience visual hallucinations that can be frightening.
Individuals intoxicated with hallucinogens may exhibit a temporary
increase in suicidality.

Prevalence

Of all substance use disorders, other hallucinogen use disorder is one
of the rarest. The 12-month prevalence is estimated to be 0.5% among
12-to 17-year-olds and 0.1% among adults age 18 and older in the United
States. Rates are higher in adult males (0.2%) compared with females
(0.1%), but the opposite is observed in adolescent samples ages 12--17,
in which the 12-month rate is slightly higher in females (0.6%) than in
males (0.4%). Rates are highest in individuals younger than 30 years,
with the peak occurring in individuals ages 18--29 years (0.6%) and
decreasing to virtually 0.0% among individuals age 45 and older.

There are marked ethnic differences in 12-month prevalence of other
hallucinogen use disorder. Among youths ages 12--17 years, 12-month
prevalence is higher among Native Americans and Alaska Natives (1.2%)
than among Hispanics (0.6%), whites (0.6%), African Americans (0.2%),
and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.2%). Among adults, 12-month
prevalence of other hallucinogen use disorder is similar for Native
Americans and Alaska Natives, whites, and Hispanics (all 0.2%) but
somewhat lower for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.07%) and
African Americans (0.03%). Past-year prevalence is higher in clinical
samples (e.g., 19% in adolescents in treatment). Among individuals
currently using hallucinogens in the general population, 7.8% (adult) to
17% (adolescent) had a problematic pattern of use that met criteria for
past-year other hallucinogen use disorder.

Among select groups of individuals who use hallucinogens (e.g., recent
heavy ecstasy use), 73.5% of adults and 77% of adolescents have a
problematic pattern of use that may meet other hallucinogen use disorder
criteria.

Development and Course

Unlike most substances where an early age at onset is associated with
elevations in risk for the corresponding use disorder, it is unclear
whether there is an association of an early age

[]{#index_split_066.html#p571}**526**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

at onset with elevations in risk for other hallucinogen use disorder.
However, patterns of drug consumption have been found to differ by age
at onset, with early-onset ecstasy users more likely to be polydrug
users than their later-onset counterparts. There may be a
disproportionate influence of use of specific hallucinogens on risk of
developing other hallucinogen use disorder, with use of ecstasy/MDMA
increasing the risk of the disorder relative to use of other
hallucinogens.

Little is known regarding the course of other hallucinogen use disorder,
but it is generally thought to have low incidence, low persistence, and
high rates of recovery. Adolescents are especially at risk for using
these drugs, and it is estimated that 2.7% of youths ages 12--17 years
have used one or more of these drugs in the past 12 months, with 44%
having used ecstasy/

MDMA. Other hallucinogen use disorder is a disorder observed primarily
in individuals younger than 30 years, with rates vanishingly rare among
older adults.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

In adolescents but not consistently in adults, MDMA use is associated
with an elevated rate of other hallucinogen use disorder. Other
substance use disorders, particularly alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis,
and major depressive disorder are associated with elevated rates of
other hallucinogen use disorder. Antisocial personality disorder may be
elevated among individuals who use more than two other drugs in addition
to hallucinogens, compared with their counterparts with less extensive
use history. The influence of adult antisocial behaviors---but not
conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder---on other
hallucinogen use disorder may be stronger in females than in males. Use
of specific hallucinogens (e.g., salvia) is prominent among individuals
ages 18--25 years with other risk-taking behaviors and illegal
activities. Cannabis use has also been implicated as a precursor to
initiation of use of hallucinogens (e.g., ecstasy), along with early use
of alcohol and tobacco. Higher drug use by peers and high sensation
seeking have also been associated with elevated rates of ecstasy use.

MDMA/ecstasy use appears to signify a more severe group of hallucinogen
users.

Genetic and physiological.

Among male twins, total variance due to additive genetics has been
estimated to range from 26% to 79%, with inconsistent evidence for
shared environmental influences.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Historically, hallucinogens have been used as part of established
religious practices, such as the use of peyote in the Native American
Church and in Mexico. Ritual use by indigenous populations of psilocybin
obtained from certain types of mushrooms has occurred in South America,
Mexico, and some areas in the United States, or of ayahuasca in the
Santo Daime and União de Vegetal sects. Regular use of peyote as part of
religious rituals is not linked to neuropsychological or psychological
deficits. For adults, no race or ethnicity differences for the full
criteria or for any individual criterion are apparent at this time.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

In adolescents, females may be less likely than males to endorse
"hazardous use," and female gender may be associated with increased odds
of other hallucinogen use disorder.

Diagnostic Markers

Laboratory testing can be useful in distinguishing among the different
hallucinogens.

However, because some agents (e.g., LSD) are so potent that as little as
75 micrograms can produce severe reactions, typical toxicological
examination will not always reveal which substance has been used.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p572}Phencyclidine Intoxication

**527**

Functional Consequences of

Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder

There is evidence for long-term neurotoxic effects of MDMA/ecstasy use,
including impairments in memory, psychological function, and
neuroendocrine function; serotonin system dysfunction; and sleep
disturbance; as well as adverse effects on brain microvas-culature,
white matter maturation, and damage to axons. Use of MDMA/ecstasy may
diminish functional connectivity among brain regions.

Differential Diagnosis

Other substance use disorders.

The effects of hallucinogens must be distinguished from those of other
substances (e.g., amphetamines), especially because contamination of the
hallucinogens with other drugs is relatively common.

Schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia also must be ruled out, as some affected individuals
(e.g., individuals with schizophrenia who exhibit paranoia) may falsely
attribute their symptoms to use of hallucinogens.

Other mental disorders or medical conditions.

Other potential disorders or conditions

to consider include panic disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders,
alcohol or sedative withdrawal, hypoglycemia and other metabolic
conditions, seizure disorder, stroke, oph-thalmological disorder, and
central nervous system tumors. Careful history of drug taking,
collateral reports from family and friends (if possible), age, clinical
history, physical examination, and toxicology reports should be useful
in arriving at the final diagnostic decision.

Comorbidity

Adolescents who use MDMA/ecstasy and other hallucinogens, as well as
adults who have recently used ecstasy, have a higher prevalence of other
substance use disorders compared with nonhallucinogen substance users.
Individuals who use hallucinogens exhibit elevations of nonsubstance
mental disorders (especially anxiety, depressive, and bipolar
disorders), particularly with use of ecstasy and salvia. Rates of
antisocial personality disorder (but not conduct disorder) are
significantly elevated among individuals with other hallucinogen use
disorder, as are rates of adult antisocial behavior. However, it is
unclear whether the mental illnesses may be precursors to rather than
consequences of other hallucinogen use disorder (see the section "Risk
and Prognostic Factors" for this disorder). Both adults and adolescents
who use ecstasy are more likely than other drug users to be polydrug
users and to have other drug use disorders.

Phencyclidine Intoxication

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Recent use of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar
substance).

B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral changes (e.g.,
belligerence, assaultiveness, impulsiveness, unpredictability,
psychomotor agitation, impaired judgment) that developed during, or
shortly after, phencyclidine use.

C. Within 1 hour, two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms:
**Note:** When the drug is smoked, "snorted," or used intravenously, the
onset may be particularly rapid.

1\. Vertical or horizontal nystagmus.

2\. Hypertension or tachycardia.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p573}**528**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

3\. Numbness or diminished responsiveness to pain.

4\. Ataxia.

5\. Dysarthria.

6\. Muscle rigidity.

7\. Seizures or coma.

8\. Hyperacusis.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid phencyclidine use disorder. If a
mild phencyclidine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
**F16.129,** and if a moderate or severe phencyclidine use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.229.** If there is no comorbid
phencyclidine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.929.**

**Note:** In addition to the section "Functional Consequences of
Phencyclidine Intoxication,"

see the corresponding section in phencyclidine use disorder.

Diagnostic Features

Phencyclidine intoxication reflects the clinically significant
behavioral changes that occur shortly after ingestion of this substance
(or a pharmacologically similar substance). The most common clinical
presentations of phencyclidine intoxication include disorientation,
confusion without hallucinations, hallucinations or delusions, a
catatonic-like syndrome, and coma of varying severity. The intoxication
typically lasts for several hours but, depending on the type of clinical
presentation and whether other drugs besides phencyclidine were
consumed, may last for several days or longer.

Prevalence

Use of phencyclidine or related substances may be taken as an estimate
of the prevalence of intoxication. Approximately 2.5% of the population
reports having ever used phencyclidine. Among high school students, 2.3%
of 12th graders report ever using phencyclidine, with 57% having used in
the past 12 months. This represents an increase from prior to 2011.
Past-year use of ketamine, which is assessed separately from other
substances, has remained stable over time, with about 1.7% of 12th
graders reporting use.

Diagnostic Markers

Laboratory testing may be useful, as phencyclidine is detectable in
urine for up to 8 days following use, although the levels are only
weakly associated with an individual's clinical presentation and may
therefore not be useful for case management. Creatine phosphoki-nase and
aspartate aminotransferase levels may be elevated.

Functional Consequences of Phencyclidine Intoxication Phencyclidine
intoxication produces extensive cardiovascular and neurological (e.g.,
seizures, dystonias, dyskinesias, catalepsy, hypothermia or
hyperthermia) toxicity.

Differential Diagnosis

In particular, in the absence of intact reality testing (i.e., without
insight into any perceptual abnormalities), an additional diagnosis of
phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder should be considered.

Other substance intoxication.

Phencyclidine intoxication should be differentiated from intoxication
due to other substances, including other hallucinogens; amphetamine, co-

[]{#index_split_066.html#p574}Other Hallucinogen Intoxication

**529**

caine, or other stimulants; and anticholinergics, as well as withdrawal
from benzodiazepines. Nystagmus and bizarre and violent behavior may
distinguish intoxication due to phencyclidine from that due to other
substances. Toxicological tests may be useful in making this
distinction, since phencyclidine is detectable in urine for up to 8 days
after use.

However, there is a weak correlation between quantitative toxicology
levels of phencyclidine and clinical presentation that diminishes the
utility of the laboratory findings for patient management.

Other conditions.

Other conditions to be considered include schizophrenia, depression,
withdrawal from other drugs (e.g., sedatives, alcohol), certain
metabolic disorders like hypoglycemia and hyponatremia, central nervous
system tumors, seizure disorders, sepsis, neuroleptic malignant
syndrome, and vascular insults.

Other Hallucinogen Intoxication

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Recent use of a hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine).

B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., marked anxiety or depression, ideas of reference, fear of
"losing one's mind," paranoid ideation, impaired judgment) that
developed during, or shortly after, hallucinogen use.

C. Perceptual changes occurring in a state of full wakefulness and
alertness (e.g., subjective intensification of perceptions,
depersonalization, derealization, illusions, hallucinations,
synesthesias) that developed during, or shortly after, hallucinogen use.

D. Two (or more) of the following signs developing during, or shortly
after, hallucinogen use:

1\. Pupillary dilation.

2\. Tachycardia.

3\. Sweating.

4\. Palpitations.

5\. Blurring of vision.

6\. Tremors.

7\. Incoordination.

E. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid hallucinogen use disorder. If a
mild hallucinogen use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
**F16.129,** and if a moderate or severe hallucinogen use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.229.** If there is no comorbid
hallucinogen use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F16.929.**

**Note:** For information on Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
and Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues, see the corresponding sections in
other hallucinogen use disorder.

Diagnostic Features

Other hallucinogen intoxication reflects the clinically significant
behavioral or psychological changes that occur shortly after ingestion
of a hallucinogen. Depending on the specific hallucinogen, the
intoxication may last only minutes (e.g., for salvia) or several hours
or longer (e.g., for LSD \[lysergic acid diethylamide\] or MDMA
\[3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine\]).

[]{#index_split_066.html#p575}**530**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Prevalence

The prevalence of other hallucinogen intoxication may be estimated by
use of those substances. In the United States, 1.8% of individuals age
12 years or older report using hallucinogens in the past year. Use is
more prevalent among younger individuals, with 3.1% of 12-to
17-year-olds and 7.1% of 18-to 25-year-olds using hallucinogens in the
past year, compared with only 0.7% of individuals age 26 years or older.
Twelve-month prevalence for hallucinogen use is more common in males
(2.4%) than in females (1.2%), and even more so among 18-to 25-year-olds
(9.2% for males vs. 5.0% for females). In contrast, among individuals
ages 12--17 years, there are no gender differences (3.1% for both
genders). These figures may be used as proxy estimates for
gender-related differences in the prevalence of other hallucinogen
intoxication.

Suicide Risk

Other hallucinogen intoxication may lead to increased suicidality,
although suicide is rare among users of hallucinogens.

Functional Consequences of

Other Hallucinogen Intoxication

Other hallucinogen intoxication can have serious consequences. The
perceptual disturbances and impaired judgment associated with other
hallucinogen intoxication can result in injuries or fatalities from
automobile crashes, physical fights, or unintentional self-injury (e.g.,
attempts to "fly" from high places). Environmental factors and the
personality and expectations of the individual using the hallucinogen
may contribute to the nature of and severity of hallucinogen
intoxication. Continued use of hallucinogens, particularly MDMA, has
also been linked with neurotoxic effects.

Differential Diagnosis

Other substance intoxication.

Other hallucinogen intoxication should be differentiated from
intoxication with amphetamines, cocaine, or other stimulants;
anticholinergics; inhalants; and phencyclidine. Toxicological tests are
useful in making this distinction, and determining the route of
administration may also be useful.

Other conditions.

Other disorders and conditions to be considered include schizophrenia,
depression, withdrawal from other drugs (e.g., sedatives, alcohol),
certain metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia), seizure disorders,
tumors of the central nervous system, and vascular insults.

Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder.

Other hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished from hallucinogen
persisting perception disorder because the symptoms in the latter
continue episodically or continuously for weeks (or longer) after the
most recent intoxication.

Other hallucinogen-induced disorders.

Other hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished

from the other hallucinogen-induced disorders (e.g.,
hallucinogen-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication)
because the symptoms in these latter disorders predominate the clinical
presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical
attention.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p576}Hallucinogen Persisting Perception
Disorder **531**

Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**292.89 (F16.983)**

A. Following cessation of use of a hallucinogen, the reexperiencing of
one or more of the perceptual symptoms that were experienced while
intoxicated with the hallucinogen (e.g., geometric hallucinations, false
perceptions of movement in the peripheral visual fields, flashes of
color, intensified colors, trails of images of moving objects, positive
afterimages, halos around objects, macropsia and micropsia).

B. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

C. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g.,
anatomical lesions and infections of the brain, visual epilepsies) and
are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., delirium,
major neurocognitive disorder, schizophrenia) or hypnopompic
hallucinations.

Diagnostic Features

The hallmark of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder is the
reexperiencing, when the individual is sober, of the perceptual
disturbances that were experienced while the individual was intoxicated
with the hallucinogen (Criterion A). The symptoms may include any
perceptual perturbations, but visual disturbances tend to be
predominant. Typical of the abnormal visual perceptions are geometric
hallucinations, false perceptions of movement in the peripheral visual
fields, flashes of color, intensified colors, trails of images of moving
objects (i.e., images left suspended in the path of a moving object as
seen in stroboscopic pho-tography), perceptions of entire objects,
positive afterimages (i.e., a same-colored or complementary-colored
"shadow" of an object remaining after removal of the object), halos
around objects, or misperception of images as too large (macropsia) or
too small (micropsia).

Duration of the visual disturbances may be episodic or nearly continuous
and must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion B). The
disturbances may last for weeks, months, or years. Other explanations
for the disturbances (e.g., brain lesions, preexisting psychosis,
seizure disorders, migraine aura without headaches) must be ruled out
(Criterion C).

Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder occurs primarily after LSD
(lysergic acid diethylamide) use, but not exclusively. There does not
appear to be a strong correlation between hallucinogen persisting
perception disorder and number of occasions of hallucinogen use, with
some instances of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder occurring
in individuals with minimal exposure to hallucinogens. Some instances of
hallucinogen persisting perception disorder may be triggered by use of
other substances (e.g., cannabis or alcohol) or in adaptation to dark
environments.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Reality testing remains intact in individuals with hallucinogen
persisting perception disorder (i.e., the individual is aware that the
disturbance is linked to the effect of the drug).

If this is not the case, another disorder might better explain the
abnormal perceptions.

Prevalence

Prevalence estimates of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder are
unknown. Initial prevalence estimates of the disorder among individuals
who use hallucinogens is approximately 4.2%.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p577}**532**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Development and Course

Little is known about the development of hallucinogen persisting
perception disorder. Its course, as suggested by its name, is
persistent, lasting for weeks, months, or even years in certain
individuals.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

There is little evidence regarding risk factors for hallucinogen
persisting perception disorder, although genetic factors have been
suggested as a possible explanation underlying the susceptibility to LSD
effects in this condition.

Functional Consequences of

Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder

Although hallucinogen persisting perception disorder remains a chronic
condition in some cases, many individuals with the disorder are able to
suppress the disturbances and continue to function normally.

Differential Diagnosis

Conditions to be ruled out include schizophrenia, other drug effects,
neurodegenerative disorders, stroke, brain tumors, infections, and head
trauma. Neuroimaging results in hallucinogen persisting perception
disorder cases are typically negative. As noted earlier, reality testing
remains intact (i.e., the individual is aware that the disturbance is
linked to the effect of the drug); if this is not the case, another
disorder (e.g., psychotic disorder, another medical condition) might
better explain the abnormal perceptions.

Comorbidity

Common comorbid mental disorders accompanying hallucinogen persisting
perception disorder are panic disorder, alcohol use disorder, and major
depressive disorder.

**Other Phencyclidine-Induced Disorders**

Other phencyclidine-induced disorders are described in other chapters of
the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorders"); phencyclidine-induced bipolar disorder
("Bipolar and Related Disorders"); phencyclidine-induced depressive
disorder ("Depressive Disorders"); and phencyclidine-induced anxiety
disorder ("Anxiety Disorders"). For phencyclidine-induced intoxication
delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter
"Neurocognitive Disorders." These phencyclidine-induced disorders are
diagnosed instead of phencyclidine intoxication only when the symptoms
are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

**Other Hallucinogen-Induced Disorders**

The following other hallucinogen-induced disorders are described in

Unspecified Phencyclidine-Related Disorder

**292.9 (F16.99)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a phencyclidine-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any

Inhalant Use Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. A problematic pattern of use of a hydrocarbon-based inhalant
substance leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as
manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1\. The inhalant substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a
longer period than was intended.

2\. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control use of the inhalant substance.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p579}**534**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

3\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the
inhalant substance, use it, or recover from its effects.

4\. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance.

5\. Recurrent use of the inhalant substance resulting in a failure to
fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.

6\. Continued use of the inhalant substance despite having persistent or
recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the
effects of its use.

7\. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of use of the inhalant substance.

8\. Recurrent use of the inhalant substance in situations in which it is
physically hazardous.

9\. Use of the inhalant substance is continued despite knowledge of
having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that
is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance.

10\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of the inhalant substance to achieve
intoxication or desired effect.

b\. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount
of the inhalant substance.

*Specify* **the particular inhalant:** When possible, the particular
substance involved should be named (e.g., "solvent use disorder").

*Specify* if:

**In early remission:** After full criteria for inhalant use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for inhalant use disorder have
been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
the inhalant substance," may be met).

**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for inhalant use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for inhalant use
disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use the inhalant substance," may be met).

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to inhalant substances
is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an
inhalant intoxication or another inhalant-induced mental disorder is
also present, do not use the codes below for inhalant use disorder.
Instead, the comorbid inhalant use disorder is indicated in the 4th
character of the inhalant-induced disorder code (see the coding note for
inhalant intoxication or a specific inhalant-induced mental disorder).
For example, if there is comorbid inhalant-induced depressive disorder
and inhalant use disorder, only the inhalant-induced depressive disorder
code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid
inhalant use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F18.14 for mild
inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced depressive disorder or
F18.24 for a moderate or severe inhalant use disorder with
inhalant-induced depressive disorder.

*Specify* current severity:

**305.90 (F18.10) Mild:** Presence of 2--3 symptoms.

**304.60 (F18.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4--5 symptoms.

**304.60 (F18.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p580}Inhalant Use Disorder

**535**

Specifiers

This manual recognizes volatile hydrocarbon use meeting the above
diagnostic criteria as inhalant use disorder. Volatile hydrocarbons are
toxic gases from glues, fuels, paints, and other volatile compounds.
When possible, the particular substance involved should be named (e.g.,
"toluene use disorder"). However, most compounds that are inhaled are a
mixture of several substances that can produce psychoactive effects, and
it is often difficult to ascertain the exact substance responsible for
the disorder. Unless there is clear evidence that a single, unmixed
substance has been used, the general term inhalant should be used in
recording the diagnosis. Disorders arising from inhalation of nitrous
oxide or of amyl-, butyl-, or isobutylnitrite are considered as other
(or unknown) substance use disorder.

"In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier of
remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

The severity of individuals' inhalant use disorder is assessed by the
number of diagnostic criteria endorsed. Changing severity of
individuals' inhalant use disorder across time is reflected by
reductions in the frequency (e.g., days used per month) and/or dose
(e.g., tubes of glue per day) used, as assessed by the individual's
self-report, report of others, clinician's observations, and biological
testing (when practical).

Diagnostic Features

Features of inhalant use disorder include repeated use of an inhalant
substance despite the individual's knowing that the substance is causing
serious problems for the individual (Criterion A9). Those problems are
reflected in the diagnostic criteria.

Missing work or school or inability to perform typical responsibilities
at work or school (Criterion A5), and continued use of the inhalant
substance even though it causes arguments with family or friends,
fights, and other social or interpersonal problems (Criterion A6), may
be seen in inhalant use disorder. Limiting family contact, work or
school obligations, or recreational activities (e.g., sports, games,
hobbies) may also occur (Criterion A7). Use of inhalants when driving or
operating dangerous equipment (Criterion A8) is also seen.

Tolerance (Criterion A10) and mild withdrawal are each reported by about
10% of individuals who use inhalants, and a few individuals use
inhalants to avoid withdrawal.

However, because the withdrawal symptoms are mild, this manual neither
recognizes a diagnosis of inhalant withdrawal nor counts withdrawal
complaints as a diagnostic criterion for inhalant use disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A diagnosis of inhalant use disorder is supported by recurring episodes
of intoxication with negative results in standard drug screens (which do
not detect inhalants); possession, or lingering odors, of inhalant
substances; perioral or perinasal "glue-sniffer's rash"; association
with other individuals known to use inhalants; membership in groups with
prevalent inhalant use (e.g., some native or aboriginal communities,
homeless children in street gangs); easy access to certain inhalant
substances; paraphernalia possession; presence of the disorder's
characteristic medical complications (e.g., brain white matter
pathology, rhabdomyolysis); and the presence of multiple substance use
disorders. Inhalant use and inhalant use disorder are associated with
past suicide attempts, especially among adults reporting previous
episodes of low mood or anhedonia.

Prevalence

About 0.4% of Americans ages 12--17 years have a pattern of use that
meets criteria for inhalant use disorder in the past 12 months. Among
those youths, the prevalence is highest

[]{#index_split_066.html#p581}**536**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

in Native Americans and lowest in African Americans. Prevalence falls to
about 0.1% among Americans ages 18--29 years, and only 0.02% when all
Americans 18 years or older are considered, with almost no females and a
preponderance of European Americans. Of course, in isolated subgroups,
prevalence may differ considerably from these overall rates.

Development and Course

About 10% of 13-year-old American children report having used inhalants
at least once; that percentage remains stable through age 17 years.
Among those 12-to 17-year-olds who use inhalants, the more-used
substances include glue, shoe polish, or toluene; gasoline or lighter
fluid; or spray paints.

Only 0.4% of 12-to 17-year-olds progress to inhalant use disorder; those
youths tend to exhibit multiple other problems. The declining prevalence
of inhalant use disorder after adolescence indicates that this disorder
usually remits in early adulthood.

Volatile hydrocarbon use disorder is rare in prepubertal children, most
common in adolescents and young adults, and uncommon in older persons.
Calls to poison-control centers for "intentional abuse" of inhalants
peak with calls involving individuals at age 14 years.

Of adolescents who use inhalants, perhaps one-fifth develop inhalant use
disorder; a few die from inhalant-related accidents, or "sudden sniffing
death". But the disorder apparently remits in many individuals after
adolescence. Prevalence declines dramatically among individuals in their
20s. Those with inhalant use disorder extending into adulthood often
have severe problems: substance use disorders, antisocial personality
disorder, and suicidal ideation with attempts.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Predictors of progression from nonuse of inhalants, to use, to inhalant
use disorder include comorbid non-inhalant substance use disorders and
either conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder. Other
predictors are earlier onset of inhalant use and prior use of mental
health services.

Environmental.

Inhalant gases are widely and legally available, increasing the risk of
misuse. Childhood maltreatment or trauma also is associated with
youthful progression from inhalant non-use to inhalant use disorder.

Genetic and physiological.

*Behavioral disinhibition* is a highly heritable general propensity to
not constrain behavior in socially acceptable ways, to break social
norms and rules, and to take dangerous risks, pursuing rewards
excessively despite dangers of adverse consequences.

Youths with strong behavioral disinhibition show risk factors for
inhalant use disorder: early-onset substance use disorder, multiple
substance involvement, and early conduct problems.

Because behavioral disinhibition is under strong genetic influence,
youths in families with substance and antisocial problems are at
elevated risk for inhalant use disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Certain native or aboriginal communities have experienced a high
prevalence of inhalant problems. Also, in some countries, groups of
homeless children in street gangs have extensive inhalant use problems.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Although the prevalence of inhalant use disorder is almost identical in
adolescent males and females, the disorder is very rare among adult
females.

Diagnostic Markers

Urine, breath, or saliva tests may be valuable for assessing concurrent
use of non-inhalant substances by individuals with inhalant use
disorder. However, technical problems and

[]{#index_split_066.html#p582}Inhalant Use Disorder

**537**

the considerable expense of analyses make frequent biological testing
for inhalants themselves impractical.

Functional Consequences of Inhalant Use Disorder

Because of inherent toxicity, use of butane or propane is not
infrequently fatal. Moreover, any inhaled volatile hydrocarbons may
produce "sudden sniffing death" from cardiac arrhythmia. Fatalities may
occur even on the first inhalant exposure and are not thought to be
dose-related. Volatile hydrocarbon use impairs neurobehavioral function
and causes various neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and
pulmonary problems.

Long-term inhalant users are at increased risk for tuberculosis,
HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, depression, anxiety,
bronchitis, asthma, and sinusitis. Deaths may occur from respiratory
depression, arrhythmias, asphyxiation, aspiration of vomitus, or
accident and injury.

Differential Diagnosis

Inhalant exposure (unintentional) from industrial or other accidents.

This designation

is used when findings suggest repeated or continuous inhalant exposure
but the involved individual and other informants deny any history of
purposeful inhalant use.

Inhalant use (intentional), without meeting criteria for inhalant use
disorder.

Inhalant use

is common among adolescents, but for most of those individuals, the
inhalant use does not meet the diagnostic standard of two or more
Criterion A items for inhalant use disorder in the past year.

Inhalant intoxication, without meeting criteria for inhalant use
disorder.

Inhalant intoxication occurs frequently during inhalant use disorder but
also may occur among individuals whose use does not meet criteria for
inhalant use disorder, which requires at least two of the 10 diagnostic
criteria in the past year.

Inhalant-induced disorders (i.e., inhalant-induced psychotic disorder,
depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, neurocognitive disorder, other
inhalant-induced disorders) without meeting criteria for inhalant use
disorder.

Criteria are met for a psychotic, depressive, anxiety, or major
neurocognitive disorder, and there is evidence from history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings that the deficits are etiologically
related to the effects of inhalant substances. Yet, criteria for
inhalant use disorder may not be met (i.e., fewer than 2 of the 10
criteria were present).

Other substance use disorders, especially those involving sedating
substances (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates).

Inhalant use disorder commonly co-occurs

with other substance use disorders, and the symptoms of the disorders
may be similar and overlapping. To disentangle symptom patterns, it is
helpful to inquire about which symptoms persisted during periods when
some of the substances were not being used.

Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, or infectious disorders
impairing central or peripheral nervous system function.

Individuals with inhalant use disorder may present with symptoms of
pernicious anemia, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord,
psychosis, major or minor cognitive disorder, brain atrophy,
leukoencephalopathy, and many other nervous system disorders. Of course,
these disorders also may occur in the absence of inhalant use disorder.
A history of little or no inhalant use helps to exclude inhalant use
disorder as the source of these problems.

Disorders of other organ systems.

Individuals with inhalant use disorder may present

with symptoms of hepatic or renal damage, rhabdomyolysis,
methemoglobinemia, or symptoms of other gastrointestinal,
cardiovascular, or pulmonary diseases. A history of little or no
inhalant use helps to exclude inhalant use disorder as the source of
such medical problems.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p583}**538**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Comorbidity

Individuals with inhalant use disorder receiving clinical care often
have numerous other substance use disorders. Inhalant use disorder
commonly co-occurs with adolescent conduct disorder and adult antisocial
personality disorder. Adult inhalant use and inhalant use disorder also
are strongly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.

Inhalant Intoxication

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Recent intended or unintended short-term, high-dose exposure to
inhalant substances, including volatile hydrocarbons such as toluene or
gasoline.

B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., belligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired judgment)
that developed during, or shortly after, exposure to inhalants.

C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during,
or shortly after, inhalant use or exposure:

1\. Dizziness.

2\. Nystagmus.

3\. Incoordination.

4\. Slurred speech.

5\. Unsteady gait.

6\. Lethargy.

7\. Depressed reflexes.

8\. Psychomotor retardation.

9\. Tremor.

10\. Generalized muscle weakness.

11\. Blurred vision or diplopia.

12\. Stupor or coma.

13\. Euphoria.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid inhalant use disorder. If a mild
inhalant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F18.129,**
and if a moderate or severe inhalant use disorder is comorbid, the
ICD-10-CM code is **F18.229.** If there is no comorbid inhalant use
disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F18.929.**

**Note:** For information on Development and Course, Risk and Prognostic
Factors, Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues, and Diagnostic Markers, see
the corresponding sections in inhalant use disorder.

Diagnostic Features

Inhalant intoxication is an inhalant-related, clinically significant
mental disorder that develops during, or immediately after, intended or
unintended inhalation of a volatile hydrocarbon substance. Volatile
hydrocarbons are toxic gases from glues, fuels, paints, and other
volatile compounds. When it is possible to do so, the particular
substance involved should be named (e.g., toluene intoxication). Among
those who do, the intoxication clears within a few minutes to a few
hours after the exposure ends. Thus, inhalant intoxication usually
occurs in brief episodes that may recur.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p584}Inhalant Intoxication

**539**

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Inhalant intoxication may be indicated by evidence of possession, or
lingering odors, of inhalant substances (e.g., glue, paint thinner,
gasoline, butane lighters); apparent intoxication occurring in the age
range with the highest prevalence of inhalant use (12--17 years); and
apparent intoxication with negative results from the standard drug
screens that usually fail to identify inhalants.

Prevalence

The prevalence of actual episodes of inhalant intoxication in the
general population is unknown, but it is probable that most inhalant
users would at some time exhibit use that would meet criteria for
inhalant intoxication disorder. Therefore, the prevalence of inhalant
use and the prevalence of inhalant intoxication disorder are likely
similar. In 2009 and 2010, inhalant use in the past year was reported by
0.8% of all Americans older than 12 years; the prevalence was highest in
younger age groups (3.6% for individuals 12 to 17 years old, and 1.7%
for individuals 18 to 25 years old).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Gender differences in the prevalence of inhalant intoxication in the
general population are unknown. However, if it is assumed that most
inhalant users eventually experience inhalant intoxication, gender
differences in the prevalence of inhalant *users* likely approximate
those in the proportions of males and females experiencing inhalant
intoxication. Regarding gender differences in the prevalence of inhalant
users in the United States, 1% of males older than 12 years and 0.7% of
females older than 12 years have used inhalants in the previous year,
but in the younger age groups more females than males have used
inhalants (e.g., among 12-to 17-year-olds, 3.6% of males and 4.2% of
females).

Functional Consequences of Inhalant Intoxication

Use of inhaled substances in a closed container, such as a plastic bag
over the head, may lead to unconsciousness, anoxia, and death.
Separately, "sudden sniffing death," likely from cardiac arrhythmia or
arrest, may occur with various volatile inhalants. The enhanced toxicity
of certain volatile inhalants, such as butane or propane, also causes
fatalities. Although inhalant intoxication itself is of short duration,
it may produce persisting medical and neurological problems, especially
if the intoxications are frequent.

Differential Diagnosis

Inhalant exposure, without meeting the criteria for inhalant
intoxication disorder.

The individual intentionally or unintentionally inhaled substances, but
the dose was insufficient for the diagnostic criteria for inhalant use
disorder to be met.

Intoxication and other substance/medication-induced disorders from other
substances, especially from sedating substances (e.g., alcohol,
benzodiazepines, barbiturates).

These disorders may have similar signs and symptoms, but the
intoxication is attributable to other intoxicants that may be identified
via a toxicology screen. Differentiating the source of the intoxication
may involve discerning evidence of inhalant exposure as described for
inhalant use disorder. A diagnosis of inhalant intoxication may be
suggested by possession, or lingering odors, of inhalant substances
(e.g., glue, paint thinner, gasoline, butane lighters,); paraphernalia
possession (e.g., rags or bags for concentrating glue fumes); perioral
or perinasal "glue-sniffer's rash"; reports from family or friends that
the intoxicated individual possesses or uses inhalants; apparent
intoxication despite negative results on standard drug screens (which
usually fail to identify inhalants); apparent intoxication occurring in
that age range with the highest prevalence of inhalant use (12--17

[]{#index_split_066.html#p585}**540**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

years); association with others known to use inhalants; membership in
certain small communities with prevalent inhalant use (e.g., some native
or aboriginal communities, homeless street children and adolescents); or
unusual access to certain inhalant substances.

Other inhalant-related disorders.

Episodes of inhalant intoxication do occur during,

but are not identical with, other inhalant-related disorders. Those
inhalant-related disorders are recognized by their respective diagnostic
criteria: inhalant use disorder, inhalant-induced neurocognitive
disorder, inhalant-induced psychotic disorder, inhalant-induced
depressive disorder, inhalant-induced anxiety disorder, and other
inhalant-induced disorders.

Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, or infectious disorders
that impair brain function and cognition.

Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may produce the
clinically significant behavioral or psychological changes (e.g.,
belligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired judgment) that also
characterize inhalant intoxication.

**Other Inhalant-Induced Disorders**

The following inhalant-induced disorders are described in other chapters
of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see
the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
inhalant-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other
Psychotic Disorders"); inhalant-induced depressive disorder ("Depressive
Disorders"); inhalant-induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety Disorders");
and inhalant-induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder
("Neurocognitive Disorders"). For inhalant intoxication delirium, see
the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive
Disorders." These inhalant-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of
inhalant intoxication only when symptoms are sufficiently severe to
warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Inhalant-Related Disorder

**292.9 (F18.99)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an inhalant-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific inhalant-related disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Opioid Use Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

A. A problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant
impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following,
occurring within a 12-month period: 1. Opioids are often taken in larger
amounts or over a longer period than was intended.

2\. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control opioid use.

3\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the
opioid, use the opioid, or recover from its effects.

4\. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids.

5\. Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home.

6\. Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social
or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of
opioids.

7\. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of opioid use.

8\. Recurrent opioid use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous.

9\. Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having a persistent or
recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been
caused or exacerbated by the substance.

10\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve intoxication or desired
effect.

b\. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount
of an opioid.

**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking
opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision.

11\. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The
characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome (refer to Criteria A and B of
the criteria set for opioid withdrawal, pp. 547--548).

b\. Opioids (or a closely related substance) are taken to relieve or
avoid withdrawal symptoms.

**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those
individuals taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision.

*Specify* if:

**In early remission:** After full criteria for opioid use disorder were
previously met, none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been
met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
opioids," may be met).

**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for opioid use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have
been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
opioids," may be met).

*Specify* if:

**On maintenance therapy:** This additional specifier is used if the
individual is taking a prescribed agonist medication such as methadone
or buprenorphine and none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have
been met for that class of medication (except tolerance to, or
withdrawal from, the agonist). This category also applies to those
individ-

[]{#index_split_066.html#p587}**542**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

uals being maintained on a partial agonist, an agonist/antagonist, or a
full antagonist such as oral naltrexone or depot naltrexone.

**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to opioids is
restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an
opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or another opioid-induced mental
disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for opioid use
disorder. Instead, the comorbid opioid use disorder is indicated in the
4th character of the opioid-induced disorder code (see the coding note
for opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or a specific opioid-induced
mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid opioid-induced
depressive disorder and opioid use disorder, only the opioid-induced
depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating
whether the comorbid opioid use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe:
F11.14 for mild opioid use disorder with opioid-induced depressive
disorder or F11.24 for a moderate or severe opioid use disorder with
opioid-induced depressive disorder.

*Specify* current severity:

**305.50 (F11.10) Mild:** Presence of 2--3 symptoms.

**304.00 (F11.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4--5 symptoms.

**304.00 (F11.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers

The "on maintenance therapy" specifier applies as a further specifier of
remission if the individual is both in remission and receiving
maintenance therapy. "In a controlled environment" applies as a further
specifier of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a
controlled environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled
environment or in sustained remission in a controlled environment).
Examples of these environments are closely supervised and substance-free
jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Changing severity across time in an individual is also reflected by
reductions in the frequency (e.g., days of use per month) and/or dose
(e.g., injections or number of pills) of an opioid, as assessed by the
individual's self-report, report of knowledgeable others, clinician's
observations, and biological testing.

Diagnostic Features

Opioid use disorder includes signs and symptoms that reflect compulsive,
prolonged self-administration of opioid substances that are used for no
legitimate medical purpose or, if another medical condition is present
that requires opioid treatment, that are used in doses greatly in excess
of the amount needed for that medical condition. (For example, an
individual prescribed analgesic opioids for pain relief at adequate
dosing will use significantly more than prescribed and not only because
of persistent pain.) Individuals with opioid use disorder tend to
develop such regular patterns of compulsive drug use that daily
activities are planned around obtaining and administering opioids.
Opioids are usually purchased on the illegal market but may also be
obtained from physicians by falsifying or exaggerating general medical
problems or by receiving simultaneous prescriptions from several
physicians. Health care professionals with opioid use disorder will
often obtain opioids by writing prescriptions for themselves or by
diverting opioids that have been prescribed for patients or from
pharmacy supplies. Most individuals with opioid use disorder have
significant levels of tolerance and will experience withdrawal on abrupt
discontinuation of opioid substances. Individuals with opioid use
disorder often develop conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli
(e.g., craving on seeing any heroin powder--like substance)---a
phenomenon that occurs with most drugs that cause intense psychological
changes. These responses probably contribute to relapse, are difficult
to extinguish, and typically persist long after detoxification is
completed.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p588}Opioid Use Disorder

**543**

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Opioid use disorder can be associated with a history of drug-related
crimes (e.g., possession or distribution of drugs, forgery, burglary,
robbery, larceny, receiving stolen goods).

Among health care professionals and individuals who have ready access to
controlled substances, there is often a different pattern of illegal
activities involving problems with state licensing boards, professional
staffs of hospitals, or other administrative agencies.

Marital difficulties (including divorce), unemployment, and irregular
employment are often associated with opioid use disorder at all
socioeconomic levels.

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalence of opioid use disorder is approximately 0.37%
among adults age 18 years and older in the community population. This
may be an underestimate because of the large number of incarcerated
individuals with opioid use disorders. Rates are higher in males than in
females (0.49% vs. 0.26%), with the male-to-female ratio typically being
1.5:1

for opioids other than heroin (i.e., available by prescription) and 3:1
for heroin. Female adolescents may have a higher likelihood of
developing opioid use disorders. The prevalence decreases with age, with
the prevalence highest (0.82%) among adults age 29 years or younger, and
decreasing to 0.09% among adults age 65 years and older. Among adults,
the prevalence of opioid use disorder is lower among African Americans
at 0.18% and overrepresented among Native Americans at 1.25%. It is
close to average among whites (0.38%), Asian or Pacific Islanders
(0.35%), and Hispanics (0.39%).

Among individuals in the United States ages 12--17 years, the overall
12-month prevalence of opioid use disorder in the community population
is approximately 1.0%, but the prevalence of heroin use disorder is less
than 0.1%. By contrast, analgesic use disorder is prevalent in about
1.0% of those ages 12--17 years, speaking to the importance of opioid
analgesics as a group of substances with significant health
consequences.

The 12-month prevalence of problem opioid use in European countries in
the community population ages 15--64 years is between 0.1% and 0.8%. The
average prevalence of problem opioid use in the European Union and
Norway is between 0.36% and 0.44%.

Development and Course

Opioid use disorder can begin at any age, but problems associated with
opioid use are most commonly first observed in the late teens or early
20s. Once opioid use disorder develops, it usually continues over a
period of many years, even though brief periods of abstinence are
frequent. In treated populations, relapse following abstinence is
common.

Even though relapses do occur, and while some long-term mortality rates
may be as high as 2% per year, about 20%--30% of individuals with opioid
use disorder achieve long-term abstinence. An exception concerns that of
military service personnel who became dependent on opioids in Vietnam;
over 90% of this population who had been dependent on opioids during
deployment in Vietnam achieved abstinence after they returned, but they
experienced increased rates of alcohol or amphetamine use disorder as
well as increased suicidality.

Increasing age is associated with a decrease in prevalence as a result
of early mortality and the remission of symptoms after age 40 years
(i.e., "maturing out"). However, many individuals continue have
presentations that meet opioid use disorder criteria for decades.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

The risk for opiate use disorder can be related to individual, family,
peer, and social environmental factors, but within these domains,
genetic factors play a particularly important role both directly and
indirectly. For instance, impulsivity and novelty seeking are individual
temperaments that relate to the propensity to develop

[]{#index_split_066.html#p589}**544**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

a substance use disorder but may themselves be genetically determined.
Peer factors may relate to genetic predisposition in terms of how an
individual selects his or her environment.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Despite small variations regarding individual criterion items, opioid
use disorder diagnostic criteria perform equally well across most
race/ethnicity groups. Individuals from ethnic minority populations
living in economically deprived areas have been overrepresented among
individuals with opioid use disorder. However, over time, opioid use
disorder is seen more often among white middle-class individuals,
especially females, suggesting that differences in use reflect the
availability of opioid drugs and that other social factors may impact
prevalence. Medical personnel who have ready access to opioids may be at
increased risk for opioid use disorder.

Diagnostic Markers

Routine urine toxicology test results are often positive for opioid
drugs in individuals with opioid use disorder. Urine test results remain
positive for most opioids (e.g., heroin, mor-phine, codeine, oxycodone,
propoxyphene) for 12--36 hours after administration. Fentanyl is not
detected by standard urine tests but can be identified by more
specialized procedures for several days. Methadone, buprenorphine (or
buprenorphine/naloxone combination), and LAAM (L-alpha-acetylmethadol)
have to be specifically tested for and will not cause a positive result
on routine tests for opiates. They can be detected for several days up
to more than 1 week. Laboratory evidence of the presence of other
substances (e.g., cocaine, marijuana, alcohol, amphetamines,
benzodiazepines) is common. Screening test results for hepatitis A, B,
and C virus are positive in as many as 80%--90% of injection opioid
users, either for hepatitis antigen (signifying active infection) or for
hepatitis antibody (signifying past infection). HIV is prevalent in
injection opioid users as well. Mildly elevated liver function test
results are common, either as a result of resolving hepatitis or from
toxic injury to the liver due to contaminants that have been mixed with
the injected opioid. Subtle changes in cortisol secretion patterns and
body temperature regulation have been observed for up to 6 months
following opioid detoxification.

Suicide Risk

Similar to the risk generally observed for all substance use disorders,
opioid use disorder is associated with a heightened risk for suicide
attempts and completed suicides. Particularly notable are both
accidental and deliberate opioid overdoses. Some suicide risk factors
overlap with risk factors for an opioid use disorder. In addition,
repeated opioid intoxication or withdrawal may be associated with severe
depressions that, although temporary, can be intense enough to lead to
suicide attempts and completed suicides. Available data suggest that
nonfatal accidental opioid overdose (which is common) and attempted
suicide are distinct clinically significant problems that should not be
mistaken for each other.

Functional Consequences of Opioid Use Disorder

Opioid use is associated with a lack of mucous membrane secretions,
causing dry mouth and nose. Slowing of gastrointestinal activity and a
decrease in gut motility can produce severe constipation. Visual acuity
may be impaired as a result of pupillary constriction with acute
administration. In individuals who inject opioids, sclerosed veins
("tracks") and puncture marks on the lower portions of the upper
extremities are common. Veins sometimes become so severely sclerosed
that peripheral edema develops, and individuals switch to injecting in
veins in the legs, neck, or groin. When these veins become unusable,
individuals often inject directly into their subcutaneous tissue
("skin-popping"), resulting []{#index_split_066.html#p590}Opioid Use
Disorder

**545**

in cellulitis, abscesses, and circular-appearing scars from healed skin
lesions. Tetanus and *Clostridium botulinum* infections are relatively
rare but extremely serious consequences of injecting opioids, especially
with contaminated needles. Infections may also occur in other organs and
include bacterial endocarditis, hepatitis, and HIV infection. Hepatitis
C infections, for example, may occur in up to 90% of persons who inject
opioids. In addition, the prevalence of HIV infection can be high among
individuals who inject drugs, a large proportion of whom are individuals
with opioid use disorder. HIV infection rates have been reported to be
as high as 60% among heroin users with opioid use disorder in some areas
of the United States or the Russian Federation. However, the incidence
may also be 10% or less in other areas, especially those where access to
clean injection material and paraphernalia is facilitated.

Tuberculosis is a particularly serious problem among individuals who use
drugs intravenously, especially those who are dependent on heroin;
infection is usually asymptomatic and evident only by the presence of a
positive tuberculin skin test. However, many cases of active
tuberculosis have been found, especially among those who are infected
with HIV.

These individuals often have a newly acquired infection but also are
likely to experience reactivation of a prior infection because of
impaired immune function.

Individuals who sniff heroin or other opioids into the nose ("snorting")
often develop irritation of the nasal mucosa, sometimes accompanied by
perforation of the nasal septum.

Difficulties in sexual functioning are common. Males often experience
erectile dysfunction during intoxication or chronic use. Females
commonly have disturbances of reproductive function and irregular
menses.

In relation to infections such as cellulitis, hepatitis, HIV infection,
tuberculosis, and endocarditis, opioid use disorder is associated with a
mortality rate as high as 1.5%--2% per year. Death most often results
from overdose, accidents, injuries, AIDS, or other general medical
complications. Accidents and injuries due to violence that is associated
with buying or selling drugs are common. In some areas, violence
accounts for more opioid-related deaths than overdose or HIV infection.
Physiological dependence on opioids may occur in about half of the
infants born to females with opioid use disorder; this can produce a
severe withdrawal syndrome requiring medical treatment. Although low
birth weight is also seen in children of mothers with opioid use
disorder, it is usually not marked and is generally not associated with
serious adverse consequences.

Differential Diagnosis

Opioid-induced mental disorders.

Opioid-induced disorders occur frequently in individuals with opioid use
disorder. Opioid-induced disorders may be characterized by symptoms
(e.g., depressed mood) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g.,
persistent depressive disorder \[dysthymia\] vs. opioid-induced
depressive disorder, with depressive features, with onset during
intoxication). Opioids are less likely to produce symptoms of mental
disturbance than are most other drugs of abuse. Opioid intoxication and
opioid withdrawal are distinguished from the other opioid-induced
disorders (e.g., opioid-induced depressive disorder, with onset during
intoxication) because the symptoms in these latter disorders predominate
the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent
clinical attention.

Other substance intoxication.

Alcohol intoxication and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication
can cause a clinical picture that resembles that for opioid
intoxication. A diagnosis of alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic intoxication can usually be made based on the absence of
pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to naloxone challenge.
In some cases, intoxication may be due both to opioids and to alcohol or
other sedatives. In these cases, the naloxone challenge will not reverse
all of the sedative effects.

Other withdrawal disorders.

The anxiety and restlessness associated with opioid withdrawal resemble
symptoms seen in sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. However, opioid
withdrawal is also accompanied by rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and pupillary
dilation, which

[]{#index_split_066.html#p591}**546**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

are not seen in sedative-type withdrawal. Dilated pupils are also seen
in hallucinogen intoxication and stimulant intoxication. However, other
signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, such as nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal cramps, rhinorrhea, or lacrimation, are not present.

Comorbidity

The most common medical conditions associated with opioid use disorder
are viral (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus) and bacterial infections,
particularly among users of opioids by injection. These infections are
less common in opioid use disorder with prescription opioids.

Opioid use disorder is often associated with other substance use
disorders, especially those involving tobacco, alcohol, cannabis,
stimulants, and benzodiazepines, which are often taken to reduce
symptoms of opioid withdrawal or craving for opioids, or to enhance the
effects of administered opioids. Individuals with opioid use disorder
are at risk for the development of mild to moderate depression that
meets symptomatic and duration criteria for persistent depressive
disorder (dysthymia) or, in some cases, for major depressive disorder.

These symptoms may represent an opioid-induced depressive disorder or an
exacerbation of a preexisting primary depressive disorder. Periods of
depression are especially common during chronic intoxication or in
association with physical or psychosocial stressors that are related to
the opioid use disorder. Insomnia is common, especially during
withdrawal. Antisocial personality disorder is much more common in
individuals with opioid use disorder than in the general population.
Posttraumatic stress disorder is also seen with increased frequency. A
history of conduct disorder in childhood or adolescence has been
identified as a significant risk factor for substance-related disorders,
especially opioid use disorder.

Opioid Intoxication

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Recent use of an opioid.

B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., initial euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria,
psychomotor agitation or retardation, impaired judgment) that developed
during, or shortly after, opioid use.

C. Pupillary constriction (or pupillary dilation due to anoxia from
severe overdose) and one (or more) of the following signs or symptoms
developing during, or shortly after, opioid use:

1\. Drowsiness or coma.

2\. Slurred speech.

3\. Impairment in attention or memory.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance.

*Specify* if:

**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier may be noted in the
rare instance in which hallucinations with intact reality testing or
auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a
delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether or not there is a comorbid opioid use disorder and
whether or not there are perceptual disturbances.

**For opioid intoxication without perceptual disturbances:** If a mild
opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F11.129,** and
if a moderate or severe opioid

[]{#index_split_066.html#p592}Opioid Withdrawal

**547**

use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F11.229.** If there is
no comorbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F11.929.**

**For opioid intoxication with perceptual disturbances:** If a mild
opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F11.122,** and
if a moderate or severe opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM
code is **F11.222.** If there is no comorbid opioid use disorder, then
the ICD-10-CM code is **F11.922.**

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of opioid intoxication is the presence of
clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes
(e.g., initial euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria, psychomotor
agitation or retardation, impaired judgment) that develop during, or
shortly after, opioid use (Criteria A and B). Intoxication is
accompanied by pupillary constriction (unless there has been a severe
overdose with consequent anoxia and pupillary dilation) and one or more
of the following signs: drowsiness (described as being "on the nod"),
slurred speech, and impairment in attention or memory (Criterion C);
drowsiness may progress to coma. Individuals with opioid intoxication
may demonstrate inattention to the environment, even to the point of
ignoring potentially harmful events.

The signs or symptoms must not be attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder
(Criterion D).

Differential Diagnosis

Other substance intoxication.

Alcohol intoxication and sedative-hypnotic intoxication can cause a
clinical picture that resembles opioid intoxication. A diagnosis of
alcohol or sedative-hypnotic intoxication can usually be made based on
the absence of pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to a
naloxone challenge. In some cases, intoxication may be due both to
opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives. In these cases, the naloxone
challenge will not reverse all of the sedative effects.

Other opioid-related disorders.

Opioid intoxication is distinguished from the other

opioid-induced disorders (e.g., opioid-induced depressive disorder, with
onset during intoxication) because the symptoms in the latter disorders
predominate in the clinical presentation and meet full criteria for the
relevant disorder.

Opioid Withdrawal

Diagnostic Criteria

**292.0 (F11.23)**

A. Presence of either of the following:

1\. Cessation of (or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy and
prolonged (i.e., several weeks or longer).

2\. Administration of an opioid antagonist after a period of opioid use.

B. Three (or more) of the following developing within minutes to several
days after Criterion A: 1. Dysphoric mood.

2\. Nausea or vomiting.

3\. Muscle aches.

4\. Lacrimation or rhinorrhea.

5\. Pupillary dilation, piloerection, or sweating.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p593}**548**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

6\. Diarrhea.

7\. Yawning.

8\. Fever.

9\. Insomnia.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for
opioid withdrawal is F11.23. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the
comorbid presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder,
reflecting the fact that opioid withdrawal can only occur in the
presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder. It is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild opioid use disorder with opioid
withdrawal.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of opioid withdrawal is the presence of a
characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the cessation of
(or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged
(Criterion A1). The withdrawal syndrome can also be precipitated by
administration of an opioid antagonist (e.g., naloxone or naltrexone)
after a period of opioid use (Criterion A2). This may also occur after
administration of an opioid partial agonist such as buprenorphine to a
person currently using a full opioid agonist.

Opioid withdrawal is characterized by a pattern of signs and symptoms
that are opposite to the acute agonist effects. The first of these are
subjective and consist of complaints of anxiety, restlessness, and an
"achy feeling" that is often located in the back and legs, along with
irritability and increased sensitivity to pain. Three or more of the
following must be present to make a diagnosis of opioid withdrawal:
dysphoric mood; nausea or vomiting; muscle aches; lacrimation or
rhinorrhea; pupillary dilation, piloerection, or increased sweating;
diarrhea; yawning; fever; and insomnia (Criterion B). Piloerection and
fever are associated with more severe withdrawal and are not often seen
in routine clinical practice because individuals with opioid use
disorder usually obtain substances before withdrawal becomes that far
advanced. These symptoms of opioid withdrawal must cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be
attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained
by another mental disorder (Criterion D).

Meeting diagnostic criteria for opioid withdrawal alone is not
sufficient for a diagnosis of opioid use disorder, but concurrent
symptoms of craving and drug-seeking behavior are suggestive of comorbid
opioid use disorder. ICD-10-CM codes only allow a diagnosis of opioid
withdrawal in the presence of comorbid moderate to severe opioid use
disorder.

The speed and severity of withdrawal associated with opioids depend on
the half-life of the opioid used. Most individuals who are
physiologically dependent on short-acting drugs such as heroin begin to
have withdrawal symptoms within 6--12 hours after the last dose.

Symptoms may take 2--4 days to emerge in the case of longer-acting drugs
such as methadone, LAAM (L-alpha-acetylmethadol), or buprenorphine.
Acute withdrawal symptoms for a short-acting opioid such as heroin
usually peak within 1--3 days and gradually subside over a period of
5--7 days. Less acute withdrawal symptoms can last for weeks to months.

These more chronic symptoms include anxiety, dysphoria, anhedonia, and
insomnia.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Males with opioid withdrawal may experience piloerection, sweating, and
spontaneous ejaculations while awake. Opioid withdrawal is distinct from
opioid use disorder and does not necessarily occur in the presence of
the drug-seeking behavior associated with opioid use disorder. Opioid
withdrawal may occur in any individual after cessation of repeated use
of an opioid, whether in the setting of medical management of pain,
during opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder, in the context of
private recreational use, or following attempts to self-treat symptoms
of mental disorders with opioids.

Prevalence

Among individuals from various clinical settings, opioid withdrawal
occurred in 60% of individuals who had used heroin at least once in the
prior 12 months.

Development and Course

Opioid withdrawal is typical in the course of an opioid use disorder. It
can be part of an escalating pattern in which an opioid is used to
reduce withdrawal symptoms, in turn leading to more withdrawal at a
later time. For persons with an established opioid use disorder,
withdrawal and attempts to relieve withdrawal are typical.

Differential Diagnosis

Other withdrawal disorders.

The anxiety and restlessness associated with opioid withdrawal resemble
symptoms seen in sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. However, opioid
withdrawal is also accompanied by rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and pupillary
dilation, which are not seen in sedative-type withdrawal.

Other substance intoxication.

Dilated pupils are also seen in hallucinogen intoxication and stimulant
intoxication. However, other signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal,
such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, rhinorrhea, and
lacrimation, are not present.

Other opioid-induced disorders.

Opioid withdrawal is distinguished from the other

opioid-induced disorders (e.g., opioid-induced depressive disorder, with
onset during withdrawal) because the symptoms in these latter disorders
are in excess of those usually associated with opioid withdrawal and
meet full criteria for the relevant disorder.

**Other Opioid-Induced Disorders**

The following opioid-induced disorders are described in other chapters
of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see
the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
opioid-induced depressive disorder ("Depressive Disorders");
opioid-induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety Disorders"); opioid-induced
sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"); and opioid-induced sexual
dysfunction ("Sexual Dysfunctions"). For opioid intoxication delirium
and opioid withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of
delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders." These opioid-induced
disorders are diagnosed instead of opioid intoxication or opioid
withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant
independent clinical attention.

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Unspecified Opioid-Related Disorder

**292.9 (F11.99)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an opioid-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific opioid-related disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

A. A problematic pattern of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested
by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:

1\. Sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are often taken in larger
amounts or over a longer period than was intended.

2\. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.

3\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic; use the sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic; or recover from its effects.

4\. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic.

5\. Recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use resulting in a
failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home
(e.g., repeated absences from work or poor work performance related to
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use; sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school;
neglect of children or household).

6\. Continued sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use despite having
persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or
exacerbated by the effects of sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics
(e.g., arguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication;
physical fights).

7\. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p596}Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use
Disorder **551**

8\. Recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use in situations in
which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or
operating a machine when impaired by sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use).

9\. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use is continued despite knowledge
of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem
that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic.

10\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic to
achieve intoxication or desired effect.

b\. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount
of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.

**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for individuals
taking sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical supervision.

11\. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The
characteristic withdrawal syndrome for sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal, pp. 557--558).

b\. Sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics (or a closely related
substance, such as alcohol) are taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal
symptoms.

**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for individuals
taking sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical supervision.

*Specify* if:

**In early remission:** After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder have been met for at
least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that
Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic," may be met).

**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder have been met at any time
during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that
Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic," may be met).

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics is restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal; or another sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes
below for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Instead the
comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is indicated in
the 4th character of the sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced
disorder (see the coding note for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or specific
sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorder). For
example, if there is comorbid sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder and sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder, only the sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder code is given with the 4th
character indicating whether the comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F13.14 for mild
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder or F13.24 for a
moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with
sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p597}**552**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

*Specify* current severity:

**305.40 (F13.10) Mild:** Presence of 2--3 symptoms.

**304.10 (F13.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4--5 symptoms.

**304.10 (F13.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers

"In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier of
remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Diagnostic Features

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances include benzodiazepines,
benzodiazepine-like drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zaleplon), carbamates (e.g.,
glutethimide, meprobamate), barbiturates (e.g., secobarbital), and
barbiturate-like hypnotics (e.g., glutethimide, methaqualone). This
class of substances includes all prescription sleeping medications and
almost all prescription antianxiety medications. Nonbenzodiazepine
antianxiety agents (e.g., buspirone, gepirone) are not included in this
class because they do not appear to be associated with significant
misuse.

Like alcohol, these agents are brain depressants and can produce similar
substance/

medication-induced and substance use disorders. Sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic substances are available both by prescription and illegally.
Some individuals who obtain these substances by prescription will
develop a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, while others
who misuse these substances or use them for intoxication will not
develop a use disorder. In particular, sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics with rapid onset and/or short to intermediate lengths of
action may be taken for intoxication purposes, although longer acting
substances in this class may be taken for intoxication as well.

Craving (Criterion A4), either while using or during a period of
abstinence, is a typical feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder. Misuse of substances from this class may occur on its own
or in conjunction with use of other substances. For example, individuals
may use intoxicating doses of sedatives or benzodiazepines to "come
down"

from cocaine or amphetamines or use high doses of benzodiazepines in
combination with methadone to "boost" its effects.

Repeated absences or poor work performance, school absences, suspensions
or expulsions, and neglect of children or household (Criterion A5) may
be related to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, as may the
continued use of the substances despite arguments with a spouse about
consequences of intoxication or despite physical fights (Criterion A6).
Limiting contact with family or friends, avoiding work or school, or
stopping participation in hobbies, sports, or games (Criterion A7) and
recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use when driving an
automobile or operating a machine when impaired by sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use (Criterion A8) are also seen in sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder.

Very significant levels of tolerance and withdrawal can develop to the
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic. There may be evidence of tolerance
and withdrawal in the absence of a diagnosis of a sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder in an individual who has abruptly discontinued
use of benzodiazepines that were taken for long periods of time at
prescribed and therapeutic doses. In these cases, an additional
diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is made only
if other criteria are met. That is, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
medications may be prescribed for appropriate medical purposes, and
depending on the dose regimen, these drugs may then produce tolerance
and with-

[]{#index_split_066.html#p598}Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use
Disorder **553**

drawal. If these drugs are prescribed or recommended for appropriate
medical purposes, and if they are used as prescribed, the resulting
tolerance or withdrawal does not meet the criteria for diagnosing a
substance use disorder. However, it is necessary to determine whether
the drugs were appropriately prescribed and used (e.g., falsifying
medical symptoms to obtain the medication; using more medication than
prescribed; obtaining the medication from several doctors without
informing them of the others' involvement).

Given the unidimensional nature of the symptoms of sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use disorder, severity is based on the number of criteria
endorsed.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is often associated with
other substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, opioid,
stimulant use disorders). Sedatives are often used to alleviate the
unwanted effects of these other substances. With repeated use of the
substance, tolerance develops to the sedative effects, and a
progressively higher dose is used. However, tolerance to brain stem
depressant effects develops much more slowly, and as the individual
takes more substance to achieve euphoria or other desired effects, there
may be a sudden onset of respiratory depression and hypotension, which
may result in death. Intense or repeated sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic intoxication may be associated with severe depression that,
although temporary, can lead to suicide attempt and completed suicide.

Prevalence

The 12-month prevalences of DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorder are estimated to be 0.3% among 12-to 17-year-olds and 0.2%
among adults age 18 years and older. Rates of DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use disorder are slightly greater among adult males (0.3%)
than among adult females, but for 12-to 17-year-olds, the rate for
females (0.4%) exceeds that for males (0.2%). The 12-month prevalence of
DSM-IV

sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder decreases as a function
of age and is greatest among 18-to 29-year-olds (0.5%) and lowest among
individuals 65 years and older (0.04%).

Twelve-month prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorder varies across racial/ethnic subgroups of the U.S. population.
For 12-to 17-year-olds, rates are greatest among whites (0.3%) relative
to African Americans (0.2%), Hispanics (0.2%), Native Americans (0.1%),
and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.1%). Among adults, 12-month
prevalence is greatest among Native Americans and Alaska Natives (0.8%),
with rates of approximately 0.2% among African Americans, whites, and
Hispanics and 0.1% among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.

Development and Course

The usual course of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder
involves individuals in their teens or 20s who escalate their occasional
use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic agents to the point at which
they develop problems that meet criteria for a diagnosis. This pattern
may be especially likely among individuals who have other substance use
disorders (e.g., alcohol, opioids, stimulants). An initial pattern of
intermittent use socially (e.g., at parties) can lead to daily use and
high levels of tolerance. Once this occurs, an increasing level of
interpersonal difficulties, as well as increasingly severe episodes of
cognitive dysfunction and physiological withdrawal, can be expected.

The second and less frequently observed clinical course begins with an
individual who originally obtained the medication by prescription from a
physician, usually for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, or somatic
complaints. As either tolerance or a need for higher doses of the
medication develops, there is a gradual increase in the dose and
frequency of self-administration. The individual is likely to continue
to justify use on the basis of his or her original symptoms of anxiety
or insomnia, but substance-seeking behavior becomes
[]{#index_split_066.html#p599}**554**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

more prominent, and the individual may seek out multiple physicians to
obtain sufficient supplies of the medication. Tolerance can reach high
levels, and withdrawal (including seizures and withdrawal delirium) may
occur.

As with many substance use disorders, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder generally has an onset during adolescence or early adult
life. There is an increased risk for misuse and problems from many
psychoactive substances as individuals age. In particular, cognitive
impairment increases as a side effect with age, and the metabolism of
sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics decreases with age among older
individuals. Both acute and chronic toxic effects of these substances,
especially effects on cognition, memory, and motor coordination, are
likely to increase with age as a consequence of pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic age-related changes. Individuals with major
neurocognitive disorder (dementia) are more likely to develop
intoxication and impaired physiological functioning at lower doses.

Deliberate intoxication to achieve a "high" is most likely to be
observed in teenagers and individuals in their 20s. Problems associated
with sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are also seen in individuals
in their 40s and older who escalate the dose of prescribed medications.
In older individuals, intoxication can resemble a progressive dementia.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Impulsivity and novelty seeking are individual temperaments that relate
to the propensity to develop a substance use disorder but may themselves
be genetically determined.

Environmental.

Since sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are all pharmaceuticals, a
key risk factor relates to availability of the substances. In the United
States, the historical patterns of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
misuse relate to the broad prescribing patterns.

For instance, a marked decrease in prescription of barbiturates was
associated with an increase in benzodiazepine prescribing. Peer factors
may relate to genetic predisposition in terms of how individuals select
their environment. Other individuals at heightened risk might include
those with alcohol use disorder who may receive repeated prescriptions
in response to their complaints of alcohol-related anxiety or insomnia.

Genetic and physiological.

As for other substance use disorders, the risk for sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use disorder can be related to individual, family, peer,
social, and environmental factors. Within these domains, genetic factors
play a particularly important role both directly and indirectly.
Overall, across development, genetic factors seem to play a larger role
in the onset of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder as
individuals age through puberty into adult life.

Course modifiers.

Early onset of use is associated with greater likelihood for developing
a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

There are marked variations in prescription patterns (and availability)
of this class of substances in different countries, which may lead to
variations in prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorders.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Females may be at higher risk than males for prescription drug misuse of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances.

Diagnostic Markers

Almost all sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances can be
identified through laboratory evaluations of urine or blood (the latter
of which can quantify the amounts of these

[]{#index_split_066.html#p600}Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use
Disorder **555**

agents in the body). Urine tests are likely to remain positive for up to
approximately 1 week after the use of long-acting substances, such as
diazepam or flurazepam.

Functional Consequences of

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder

The social and interpersonal consequences of sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder mimic those of alcohol in terms of the potential
for disinhibited behavior. Accidents, interpersonal difficulties (such
as arguments or fights), and interference with work or school
performance are all common outcomes. Physical examination is likely to
reveal evidence of a mild decrease in most aspects of autonomic nervous
system functioning, including a slower pulse, a slightly decreased
respiratory rate, and a slight drop in blood pressure (most likely to
occur with postural changes). At high doses, sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic substances can be lethal, particularly when mixed with
alcohol, although the lethal dosage varies considerably among the
specific substances. Overdoses may be associated with a deterioration in
vital signs that signals an impending medical emergency (e.g.,
respiratory arrest from barbiturates).

There may be consequences of trauma (e.g., internal bleeding or a
subdural hematoma) from accidents that occur while intoxicated.
Intravenous use of these substances can result in medical complications
related to the use of contaminated needles (e.g., hepatitis and HIV).

Acute intoxication can result in accidental injuries and automobile
accidents. For elderly individuals, even short-term use of these
sedating medications at prescribed doses can be associated with an
increased risk for cognitive problems and falls. The disinhibiting
effects of these agents, like alcohol, may potentially contribute to
overly aggressive behavior, with subsequent interpersonal and legal
problems. Accidental or deliberate overdoses, similar to those observed
for alcohol use disorder or repeated alcohol intoxication, can occur. In
contrast to their wide margin of safety when used alone, benzodiazepines
taken in combination with alcohol can be particularly dangerous, and
accidental overdoses are reported commonly. Accidental overdoses have
also been reported in individuals who deliberately misuse barbiturates
and other nonbenzodiazepine sedatives (e.g., methaqualone), but since
these agents are much less available than the benzodiazepines, the
frequency of overdosing is low in most settings.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders or medical conditions.

Individuals with sedative-, hypnotic-,

or anxiolytic-induced disorders may present with symptoms (e.g.,
anxiety) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., generalized
anxiety disorder vs. sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety
disorder, with onset during withdrawal). The slurred speech,
incoordination, and other associated features characteristic of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication could be the result of
another medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis) or of a prior head
trauma (e.g., a subdural hematoma).

Alcohol use disorder.

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder must be differentiated
from alcohol use disorder.

Clinically appropriate use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
medications.

Individuals

may continue to take benzodiazepine medication according to a
physician's direction for a legitimate medical indication over extended
periods of time. Even if physiological signs of tolerance or withdrawal
are manifested, many of these individuals do not develop symptoms that
meet the criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder
because they are not preoccupied with obtaining the substance and its
use does not interfere with their performance of usual social or
occupational roles.

Comorbidity

Nonmedical use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic agents is associated
with alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder, and, generally, illicit
drug use. There may also be an over-

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

lap between sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and
antisocial personality disorder; depressive, bipolar, and anxiety
disorders; and other substance use disorders, such as alcohol use
disorder and illicit drug use disorders. Antisocial behavior and
antisocial personality disorder are especially associated with sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder when the substances are obtained
illegally.

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Recent use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.

B. Clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood
lability, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after,
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.

C. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during,
or shortly after, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use:

1\. Slurred speech.

2\. Incoordination.

3\. Unsteady gait.

4\. Nystagmus.

5\. Impairment in cognition (e.g., attention, memory).

6\. Stupor or coma.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder. If a mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder
is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.129,** and if a moderate or
severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is comorbid, the
ICD-10-CM

code is **F13.229.** If there is no comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.929.**

**Note:** For information on Development and Course; Risk and Prognostic
Factors; Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues; Diagnostic Markers;
Functional Consequences of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic
Intoxication; and Comorbidity, see the corresponding sections in
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication
is the presence of clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or
psychological changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive
behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment, impaired social or
occupational functioning) that develop during, or shortly after, use of
a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic (Criteria A and B). As with other
brain depressants, such as alcohol, these behaviors may be accompanied
by slurred speech, incoordination (at levels that can interfere with
driving abilities and with performing usual activities to the point of
causing falls or automobile accidents), an unsteady gait, nystagmus,
impairment in cognition (e.g., attentional or memory problems), and
stupor or coma (Criterion C). Memory impairment is a prominent feature
of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication and is most often
characterized by an anterograde amnesia that resembles "alcoholic
blackouts," which can be disturbing to the individual. The symptoms must
not be attributable to another medical condition and are not better
explained by another []{#index_split_066.html#p602}Sedative, Hypnotic,
or Anxiolytic Withdrawal **557**

mental disorder (Criterion D). Intoxication may occur in individuals who
are receiving these substances by prescription, are borrowing the
medication from friends or relatives, or are deliberately taking the
substance to achieve intoxication.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Associated features include taking more medication than prescribed,
taking multiple different medications, or mixing sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic agents with alcohol, which can markedly increase the effects
of these agents.

Prevalence

The prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication in the
general population is unclear. However, it is probable that most
nonmedical users of sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics would at some
time have signs or symptoms that meet criteria for sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic intoxication; if so, then the prevalence of nonmedical
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use in the general population may be
similar to the prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
intoxication. For example, tranquilizers are used nonmedically by 2.2%
of Americans older than 12 years.

Differential Diagnosis

Alcohol use disorders.

Since the clinical presentations may be identical, distinguishing
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication from alcohol use
disorders requires evidence for recent ingestion of sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic medications by self-report, informant report, or
toxicological testing. Many individuals who misuse sedatives, hypnotics,
or anxiolytics may also misuse alcohol and other substances, and so
multiple intoxication diagnoses are possible.

Alcohol intoxication.

Alcohol intoxication may be distinguished from sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic intoxication by the smell of alcohol on the breath.
Otherwise, the features of the two disorders may be similar.

Other sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders.

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication is distinguished from the
other sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders (e.g.,
sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with onset
during withdrawal) because the symptoms in the latter disorders
predominate in the clinical presentation and are severe enough to
warrant clinical attention.

Neurocognitive disorders.

In situations of cognitive impairment, traumatic brain injury, and
delirium from other causes, sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may be
intoxicating at quite low dosages. The differential diagnosis in these
complex settings is based on the predominant syndrome. An additional
diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication may be
appropriate even if the substance has been ingested at a low dosage in
the setting of these other (or similar) co-occurring conditions.

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
that has been prolonged.

B. Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours to a
few days after the cessation of (or reduction in) sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use described in Criterion A: 1. Autonomic hyperactivity
(e.g., sweating or pulse rate greater than 100 bpm).

2\. Hand tremor.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p603}**558**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

3\. Insomnia.

4\. Nausea or vomiting.

5\. Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions.

6\. Psychomotor agitation.

7\. Anxiety.

8\. Grand mal seizures.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

*Specify* if:

**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier may be noted when
hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or
tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.0.** The ICD-10-CM code for
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal depends on whether or not
there is a comorbid moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder and whether or not there are perceptual disturbances. For
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal without perceptual
disturbances, the ICD-10-CM code is **F13.239.** For sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic withdrawal with perceptual disturbances, the ICD-10-CM
code is **F13.232.** Note that the ICD-10-CM

codes indicate the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, reflecting the fact that sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a
moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. It is
not permissible to code a comorbid mild sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal.

**Note:** For information on Development and Course; Risk and Prognostic
Factors; Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues; Functional Consequences of
Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal; and Comorbidity, see the
corresponding sections in sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is
the presence of a characteristic syndrome that develops after a marked
decrease in or cessation of intake after several weeks or more of
regular use (Criteria A and B). This withdrawal syndrome is
characterized by two or more symptoms (similar to alcohol withdrawal)
that include autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., increases in heart rate,
respiratory rate, blood pressure, or body temperature, along with
sweating); a tremor of the hands; insomnia; nausea, sometimes
accompanied by vomiting; anxiety; and psychomotor agitation. A grand mal
seizure may occur in perhaps as many as 20%--30% of individuals
undergoing untreated withdrawal from these substances. In severe
withdrawal, visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions can
occur but are usually in the context of a delirium. If the individual's
reality testing is intact (i.e., he or she knows the substance is
causing the hallucinations) and the illusions occur in a clear
sensorium, the specifier "with perceptual disturbances" can be noted.
When hallucinations occur in the absence of intact reality testing, a
diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be
considered. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to
another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder (e.g., alcohol withdrawal or generalized anxiety disorder)
(Criterion D). Relief of withdrawal symptoms with administration of any
sedative-hypnotic agent would support a diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic withdrawal.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p604}Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic
Withdrawal **559**

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The timing and severity of the withdrawal syndrome will differ depending
on the specific substance and its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
For example, withdrawal from shorter-acting substances that are rapidly
absorbed and that have no active metabolites (e.g., triazolam) can begin
within hours after the substance is stopped; withdrawal from substances
with long-acting metabolites (e.g., diazepam) may not begin for 1--2
days or longer. The withdrawal syndrome produced by substances in this
class may be characterized by the development of a delirium that can be
life-threatening. There may be evidence of tolerance and withdrawal in
the absence of a diagnosis of a substance use disorder in an individual
who has abruptly discontinued benzodiazepines that were taken for long
periods of time at prescribed and therapeutic doses. However, ICD-10-CM
codes only allow a diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal in the presence of comorbid moderate to severe sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.

The time course of the withdrawal syndrome is generally predicted by the
half-life of the substance. Medications whose actions typically last
about 10 hours or less (e.g., lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam) produce
withdrawal symptoms within 6--8 hours of decreasing blood levels that
peak in intensity on the second day and improve markedly by the fourth
or fifth day. For substances with longer half-lives (e.g., diazepam),
symptoms may not develop for more than 1 week, peak in intensity during
the second week, and decrease markedly during the third or fourth week.
There may be additional longer-term symptoms at a much lower level of
intensity that persist for several months.

The longer the substance has been taken and the higher the dosages used,
the more likely it is that there will be severe withdrawal. However,
withdrawal has been reported with as little as 15 mg of diazepam (or its
equivalent in other benzodiazepines) when taken daily for several
months. Doses of approximately 40 mg of diazepam (or its equivalent)
daily are more likely to produce clinically relevant withdrawal
symptoms, and even higher doses (e.g., 100 mg of diazepam) are more
likely to be followed by withdrawal seizures or delirium. Sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal delirium is characterized by
disturbances in consciousness and cognition, with visual, tactile, or
auditory hallucinations. When present, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal delirium should be diagnosed instead of withdrawal.

Prevalence

The prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is
unclear.

Diagnostic Markers

Seizures and autonomic instability in the setting of a history of
prolonged exposure to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications
suggest a high likelihood of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal.

Differential Diagnosis

Other medical disorders.

The symptoms of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal may be
mimicked by other medical conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia, diabetic
ketoacidosis). If seizures are a feature of the sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal, the differential diagnosis includes the various
causes of seizures (e.g., infections, head injury, poisonings).

Essential tremor.

Essential tremor, a disorder that frequently runs in families, may
erroneously suggest the tremulousness associated with sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.

Alcohol withdrawal.

Alcohol withdrawal produces a syndrome very similar to that of sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.

[]{#index_split_066.html#p605}**560**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Other sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders.

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is distinguished from the
other sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders (e.g.,
sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with onset
during withdrawal) because the symptoms in the latter disorders
predominate in the clinical presentation and are severe enough to
warrant clinical attention.

Anxiety disorders.

Recurrence or worsening of an underlying anxiety disorder produces a
syndrome similar to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.
Withdrawal would be suspected with an abrupt reduction in the dosage of
a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medication. When a taper is under
way, distinguishing the withdrawal syndrome from the underlying anxiety
disorder can be difficult. As with alcohol, lingering withdrawal
symptoms (e.g., anxiety, moodiness, and trouble sleeping) can be
mistaken for nonsubstance/medication-induced anxiety or depressive
disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder).

**Other Sedative-, Hypnotic-,**

**or Anxiolytic-Induced Disorders**

The following sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders are
described in other chapters of the manual with disorders with which they
share phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced mental
disorders in these chapters): sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other
Psychotic Disorders"); sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced
bipolar disorder ("Bipolar and Related Disorders"); sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder ("Depressive
Disorders"); sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety
disorder ("Anxiety Disorders"); sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"); sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced sexual dysfunction ("Sexual
Dysfunctions"); and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced major or
mild neurocognitive disorder ("Neurocognitive Disorders"). For sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication delirium and sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of
delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders." These sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication or sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to
warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Sedative-, Hypnotic-,

or Anxiolytic-Related Disorder

**292.9 (F13.99)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-related disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any specific sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-related disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Stimulant Use Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. A pattern of amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant
use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as
manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period:

1\. The stimulant is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer
period than was intended.

2\. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control stimulant use.

3\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the
stimulant, use the stimulant, or recover from its effects.

4\. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the stimulant.

5\. Recurrent stimulant use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home.

6\. Continued stimulant use despite having persistent or recurrent
social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of
the stimulant.

7\. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of stimulant use.

8\. Recurrent stimulant use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous.

9\. Stimulant use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent
or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have
been caused or exacerbated by the stimulant.

10\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of the stimulant to achieve intoxication or
desired effect.

b\. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount
of the stimulant.

**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking
stimulant medications solely under appropriate medical supervision, such
as medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or
narcolepsy.

11\. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The
characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the stimulant (refer to Criteria
A and B of the criteria set for stimulant withdrawal, p. 569).

b\. The stimulant (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve
or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

**Note:** This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking
stimulant medications solely under appropriate medical supervision, such
as medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or
narcolepsy.

*Specify* if:

**In early remission:** After full criteria for stimulant use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder
have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with
the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to
use the stimulant," may be met).

**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for stimulant use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for stimulant use
disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use the stimulant," may be met).

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to stimulants is
restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an
amphetamine intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or another
amphetamine-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the
codes below for amphetamine use disorder. Instead, the comorbid
amphetamine use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the
amphetamine-induced disorder code (see the coding note for amphetamine
intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or a specific amphetamine-induced
mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid amphetamine-type or
other stimulant-induced depressive disorder and amphetamine-type or
other stimulant use disorder, only the amphetamine-type or other
stimulant-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th
character indicating whether the comorbid amphetamine-type or other
stimulant use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F15.14 for mild
amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder with amphetamine-type
or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder or F15.24 for a moderate
or severe amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder with
amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder.
Similarly, if there is comorbid cocaine-induced depressive disorder and
cocaine use disorder, only the cocaine-induced depressive disorder code
is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid cocaine
use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F14.14 for mild cocaine use
disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder or F14.24 for a
moderate or severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive
disorder.

*Specify* current severity:

**Mild:** Presence of 2--3 symptoms.

Specifiers

"In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier of
remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Diagnostic Features

The amphetamine and amphetamine-type stimulants include substances with
a substituted-phenylethylamine structure, such as amphetamine,
dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine. Also included are those
substances that are structurally different but have similar effects,
such as methylphenidate. These substances are usually taken orally or
intravenously, although methamphetamine is also taken by the nasal
route. In addition to the synthetic amphetamine-type compounds, there
are naturally occurring, plant-derived stimulants such as *khât.*
Amphetamines and other stimulants may be obtained by prescription for
the treatment of obesity, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and
narcolepsy.

Consequently, prescribed stimulants may be diverted into the illegal
market. The effects of amphetamines and amphetamine-like drugs are
similar to those of cocaine, such that the criteria for stimulant use
disorder are presented here as a single disorder with the ability to
specify the particular stimulant used by the individual. Cocaine may be
consumed in several preparations (e.g., coca leaves, coca paste, cocaine
hydrochloride, and cocaine alka-loids such as freebase and crack) that
differ in potency because of varying levels of purity and speed of
onset. However, in all forms of the substance, cocaine is the active
ingredient.

Cocaine hydrochloride powder is usually "snorted" through the nostrils
or dissolved in water and injected intravenously.

Individuals exposed to amphetamine-type stimulants or cocaine can
develop stimulant use disorder as rapidly as 1 week, although the onset
is not always this rapid. Regardless of the route of administration,
tolerance occurs with repeated use. Withdrawal symptoms, particularly
hypersomnia, increased appetite, and dysphoria, can occur and can
enhance craving. Most individuals with stimulant use disorder have
experienced tolerance or withdrawal.

Use patterns and course are similar for disorders involving
amphetamine-type stimulants and cocaine, as both substances are potent
central nervous system stimulants with similar psychoactive and
sympathomimetic effects. Amphetamine-type stimulants are longer acting
than cocaine and thus are used fewer times per day. Usage may be chronic
or episodic, with binges punctuated by brief non-use periods. Aggressive
or violent behavior is common when high doses are smoked, ingested, or
administered intravenously. Intense temporary anxiety resembling panic
disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, as well as paranoid ideation
and psychotic episodes that resemble schizophrenia, is seen with
high-dose use.

Withdrawal states are associated with temporary but intense depressive
symptoms that can resemble a major depressive episode; the depressive
symptoms usually resolve within 1 week. Tolerance to amphetamine-type
stimulants develops and leads to escalation of the dose. Conversely,
some users of amphetamine-type stimulants develop sensitization,
characterized by enhanced effects.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

When injected or smoked, stimulants typically produce an instant feeling
of well-being, confidence, and euphoria. Dramatic behavioral changes can
rapidly develop with stimulant use disorder. Chaotic behavior, social
isolation, aggressive behavior, and sexual dysfunction can result from
long-term stimulant use disorder.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p609}**564**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Individuals with acute intoxication may present with rambling speech,
headache, transient ideas of reference, and tinnitus. There may be
paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations in a clear sensorium, and
tactile hallucinations, which the individual usually recognizes as drug
effects. Threats or acting out of aggressive behavior may occur.
Depression, suicidal ideation, irritability, anhedonia, emotional
lability, or disturbances in attention and concentration commonly occur
during withdrawal. Mental disturbances associated with cocaine use
usually resolve hours to days after cessation of use but can persist for
1 month. Physiological changes during stimulant withdrawal are opposite
to those of the intoxication phase, sometimes including bradycardia.
Temporary depressive symptoms may meet symptomatic and duration criteria
for major depressive episode. Histories consistent with repeated panic
attacks, social anxiety disorder (social phobia)--like behavior, and
generalized anxiety--like syndromes are common, as are eating disorders.
One extreme instance of stimulant toxicity is stimulant-induced
psychotic disorder, a disorder that resembles schizophrenia, with
delusions and hallucinations.

Individuals with stimulant use disorder often develop conditioned
responses to drug-related stimuli (e.g., craving on seeing any white
powderlike substance). These responses contribute to relapse, are
difficult to extinguish, and persist after detoxification.

Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or behavior can occur and are
generally the most serious problems seen during stimulant withdrawal.

Prevalence

Stimulant use disorder: amphetamine-type stimulants.

Estimated 12-month prevalence

of amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder in the United States is 0.2%
among 12-to 17-year-olds and 0.2% among individuals 18 years and older.
Rates are similar among adult males and females (0.2%), but among 12-to
17-year-olds, the rate for females (0.3%) is greater than that for males
(0.1%). Intravenous stimulant use has a male-to-female ratio of 3:1 or
4:1, but rates are more balanced among non-injecting users, with males
representing 54% of primary treatment admissions. Twelve-month
prevalence is greater among 18-to 29-year-olds (0.4%) compared with
45-to 64-year-olds (0.1%). For 12-to 17-year-olds, rates are highest
among whites and African Americans (0.3%) compared with Hispanics (0.1%)
and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.01%), with amphetamine-type
stimulant use disorder virtually absent among Native Americans. Among
adults, rates are highest among Native Americans and Alaska Natives
(0.6%) compared with whites (0.2%) and Hispanics (0.2%), with
amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder virtually absent among African
Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Past-year
nonprescribed use of prescription stimulants occurred among 5%--9% of
children through high school, with 5%--35% of college-age persons
reporting past-year use.

Stimulant use disorder: cocaine.

Estimated 12-month prevalence of cocaine use disorder in the United
States is 0.2% among 12-to 17-year-olds and 0.3% among individuals 18
years and older. Rates are higher among males (0.4%) than among females
(0.1%). Rates are highest among 18-to 29-year-olds (0.6%) and lowest
among 45-to 64-year-olds (0.1%). Among adults, rates are greater among
Native Americans (0.8%) compared with African Americans (0.4%),
Hispanics (0.3%), whites (0.2%), and Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders (0.1%). In contrast, for 12-to 17-year-olds, rates are similar
among Hispanics (0.2%), whites (0.2%), and Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders (0.2%); and lower among African Americans (0.02%); with
cocaine use disorder virtually absent among Native Americans and Alaska
Natives.

Development and Course

Stimulant use disorders occur throughout all levels of society and are
more common among individuals ages 12--25 years compared with
individuals 26 years and older. First regular use

[]{#index_split_067.html#p610}Stimulant Use Disorder

**565**

among individuals in treatment occurs, on average, at approximately age
23 years. For primary methamphetamine--primary treatment admissions, the
average age is 31 years.

Some individuals begin stimulant use to control weight or to improve
performance in school, work, or athletics. This includes obtaining
medications such as methylphenidate or amphetamine salts prescribed to
others for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Stimulant use disorder can develop rapidly with intravenous or smoked
administration; among primary admissions for amphetamine-type stimulant
use, 66% reported smoking, 18% reported injecting, and 10% reported
snorting.

Patterns of stimulant administration include episodic or daily (or
almost daily) use.

Episodic use tends to be separated by 2 or more days of non-use (e.g.,
intense use over a weekend or on one or more weekdays). "Binges" involve
continuous high-dose use over hours or days and are often associated
with physical dependence. Binges usually terminate only when stimulant
supplies are depleted or exhaustion ensues. Chronic daily use may
involve high or low doses, often with an increase in dose over time.

Stimulant smoking and intravenous use are associated with rapid
progression to severe-level stimulant use disorder, often occurring over
weeks to months. Intranasal use of cocaine and oral use of
amphetamine-type stimulants result in more gradual progression occurring
over months to years. With continuing use, there is a diminution of
pleasurable effects due to tolerance and an increase in dysphoric
effects.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Comorbid bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, antisocial personality
disorder, and other substance use disorders are risk factors for
developing stimulant use disorder and for relapse to cocaine use in
treatment samples. Also, impulsivity and similar personality traits may
affect treatment outcomes. Childhood conduct disorder and adult
antisocial personality disorder are associated with the later
development of stimulant-related disorders.

Environmental.

Predictors of cocaine use among teenagers include prenatal cocaine
exposure, postnatal cocaine use by parents, and exposure to community
violence during childhood. For youths, especially females, risk factors
include living in an unstable home environment, having a psychiatric
condition, and associating with dealers and users.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Stimulant use--attendant disorders affect all racial/ethnic,
socioeconomic, age, and gender groups. Diagnostic issues may be related
to societal consequences (e.g., arrest, school suspensions, employment
suspension). Despite small variations, cocaine and other stimulant use
disorder diagnostic criteria perform equally across gender and
race/ethnicity groups.

Chronic use of cocaine impairs cardiac left ventricular function in
African Americans.

Approximately 66% of individuals admitted for primary
methamphetamine/amphetamine-related disorders are non-Hispanic white,
followed by 21% of Hispanic origin, 3%

Asian and Pacific Islander, and 3% non-Hispanic black.

Diagnostic Markers

Benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, typically remains in the urine
for 1--3 days after a single dose and may be present for 7--12 days in
individuals using repeated high doses.

Mildly elevated liver function tests can be present in cocaine injectors
or users with concomitant alcohol use. There are no neurobiological
markers of diagnostic utility. Discontinuation of chronic cocaine use
may be associated with electroencephalographic changes, suggesting
persistent abnormalities; alterations in secretion patterns of
prolactin; and downregulation of dopamine receptors.

Short-half-life amphetamine-type stimulants (MDMA \[3,4-methylenedioxy-
*N*-methylamphetamine\], methamphetamine) can be detected for 1--3 days,
and possibly up to 4 days

[]{#index_split_067.html#p611}**566**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

depending on dosage and metabolism. Hair samples can be used to detect
presence of amphetamine-type stimulants for up to 90 days. Other
laboratory findings, as well as physical findings and other medical
conditions (e.g., weight loss, malnutrition; poor hygiene), are similar
for both cocaine and amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder.

Functional Consequences of Stimulant Use Disorder

Various medical conditions may occur depending on the route of
administration. Intranasal users often develop sinusitis, irritation,
bleeding of the nasal mucosa, and a perforated nasal septum. Individuals
who smoke the drugs are at increased risk for respiratory problems
(e.g., coughing, bronchitis, and pneumonitis). Injectors have puncture
marks and

"tracks," most commonly on their forearms. Risk of HIV infection
increases with frequent intravenous injections and unsafe sexual
activity. Other sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis, and
tuberculosis and other lung infections are also seen. Weight loss and
malnutrition are common.

Chest pain may be a common symptom during stimulant intoxication.
Myocardial infarction, palpitations and arrhythmias, sudden death from
respiratory or cardiac arrest, and stroke have been associated with
stimulant use among young and otherwise healthy individuals. Seizures
can occur with stimulant use. Pneumothorax can result from performing
Valsalva-like maneuvers done to better absorb inhaled smoke. Traumatic
injuries due to violent behavior are common among individuals
trafficking drugs. Cocaine use is associated with irregularities in
placental blood flow, abruptio placentae, premature labor and delivery,
and an increased prevalence of infants with very low birth weights.

Individuals with stimulant use disorder may become involved in theft,
prostitution, or drug dealing in order to acquire drugs or money for
drugs.

Neurocognitive impairment is common among methamphetamine users. Oral
health problems include "meth mouth" with gum disease, tooth decay, and
mouth sores related to the toxic effects of smoking the drug and to
bruxism while intoxicated. Adverse pulmonary effects appear to be less
common for amphetamine-type stimulants because they are smoked fewer
times per day. Emergency department visits are common for
stimulant-related mental disorder symptoms, injury, skin infections, and
dental pathology.

Differential Diagnosis

Primary mental disorders.

Stimulant-induced disorders may resemble primary mental disorders (e.g.,
major depressive disorder) (for discussion of this differential
diagnosis, see

"Stimulant Withdrawal"). The mental disturbances resulting from the
effects of stimulants should be distinguished from the symptoms of
schizophrenia; depressive and bipolar disorders; generalized anxiety
disorder; and panic disorder.

Phencyclidine intoxication.

Intoxication with phencyclidine ("PCP" or "angel dust") or synthetic
"designer drugs" such as mephedrone (known by different names, including

"bath salts") may cause a similar clinical picture and can only be
distinguished from stimulant intoxication by the presence of cocaine or
amphetamine-type substance metabolites in a urine or plasma sample.

Stimulant intoxication and withdrawal.

Stimulant intoxication and withdrawal are distinguished from the other
stimulant-induced disorders (e.g., anxiety disorder, with onset during
intoxication) because the symptoms in the latter disorders predominate
the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent
clinical attention.

Comorbidity

Stimulant-related disorders often co-occur with other substance use
disorders, especially those involving substances with sedative
properties, which are often taken to reduce in-

[]{#index_split_067.html#p612}Stimulant Intoxication

**567**

somnia, nervousness, and other unpleasant side effects. Cocaine users
often use alcohol, while amphetamine-type stimulant users often use
cannabis. Stimulant use disorder may be associated with posttraumatic
stress disorder, antisocial personality disorder,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and gambling disorder.
Cardiopulmonary problems are often present in individuals seeking
treatment for cocaine-related problems, with chest pain being the most
common. Medical problems occur in response to adulterants used as
"cutting" agents. Cocaine users who ingest cocaine cut with levamisole,
an antimicrobial and veterinary medication, may experience
agranulocytosis and febrile neutropenia.

Stimulant Intoxication

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Recent use of an amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other
stimulant.

B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., euphoria or affective blunting; changes in sociability;
hypervigilance; interpersonal sensitivity; anxiety, tension, or anger;
stereotyped behaviors; impaired judgment) that developed during, or
shortly after, use of a stimulant.

C. Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms, developing during,
or shortly after, stimulant use:

1\. Tachycardia or bradycardia.

2\. Pupillary dilation.

3\. Elevated or lowered blood pressure.

4\. Perspiration or chills.

5\. Nausea or vomiting.

6\. Evidence of weight loss.

7\. Psychomotor agitation or retardation.

8\. Muscular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac
arrhythmias.

9\. Confusion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance.

cocaine, or other stimulant).

*Specify* if:

**With perceptual disturbances:** This specifier may be noted when
hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or
tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or other
stimulant; whether there is a comorbid amphetamine, cocaine, or other
stimulant use disorder; and whether or not there are perceptual
disturbances.

**For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication, without
perceptual disturbances:** If a mild amphetamine or other stimulant use
disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F15.129,** and if a
moderate or severe amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F15.229.** If there is no comorbid
amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is
**F15.929.** Similarly, if a mild cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the
ICD-10-CM code is **F14.129,** and if a moderate or severe cocaine use
disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F14.229.** If there is no
comorbid cocaine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F14.929.**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

**For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication, with
perceptual disturbances:** If a mild amphetamine or other stimulant use
disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F15.122,** and if a
moderate or severe amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F15.222.** If there is no comorbid
amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is

ICD-10-CM code is **F14.122,** and if a moderate or severe cocaine use
disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F14.222.** If there is no
comorbid cocaine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F14.922.**

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of stimulant intoxication, related to
amphetamine-type stimulants and cocaine, is the presence of clinically
significant behavioral or psychological changes that develop during, or
shortly after, use of stimulants (Criteria A and B). Auditory
hallucinations may be prominent, as may paranoid ideation, and these
symptoms must be distinguished from an independent psychotic disorder
such as schizophrenia. Stimulant intoxication usually begins with a
"high" feeling and includes one or more of the following: euphoria with
enhanced vigor, gregariousness, hyperactivity, restlessness,
hypervigilance, interpersonal sensitivity, talkativeness, anxiety,
tension, alertness, grandiosity, stereotyped and repetitive behavior,
anger, impaired judgment, and, in the case of chronic intoxication,
affective blunting with fatigue or sadness and social withdrawal. These
behavioral and psychological changes are accompanied by two or more of
the following signs and symptoms that develop during or shortly after
stimulant use: tachycardia or bradycardia; pupillary dilation; elevated
or lowered blood pressure; perspiration or chills; nausea or vomiting;
evidence of weight loss; psychomotor agitation or retardation; muscular
weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhythmias;
and confusion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma (Criterion C).
Intoxication, either acute or chronic, is often associated with impaired
social or occupational functioning. Severe intoxication can lead to
convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperpyrexia, and death. For the
diagnosis of stimulant intoxication to be made, the symptoms must not be
attributable to another medical condition and not better explained by
another mental disorder (Criterion D). While stimulant intoxication
occurs in individuals with stimulant use disorders, intoxication is not
a criterion for stimulant use disorder, which is confirmed by the
presence of two of the 11 diagnostic criteria for use disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The magnitude and direction of the behavioral and physiological changes
depend on many variables, including the dose used and the
characteristics of the individual using the substance or the context
(e.g., tolerance, rate of absorption, chronicity of use, context in
which it is taken). Stimulant effects such as euphoria, increased pulse
and blood pressure, and psychomotor activity are most commonly seen.
Depressant effects such as sadness, bradycardia, decreased blood
pressure, and decreased psychomotor activity are less common and
generally emerge only with chronic high-dose use.

Differential Diagnosis

Stimulant-induced disorders.

Stimulant intoxication is distinguished from the other stimulant-induced
disorders (e.g., stimulant-induced depressive disorder, bipolar
disorder, psychotic disorder, anxiety disorder) because the severity of
the intoxication symptoms exceeds that associated with the
stimulant-induced disorders, and the symptoms warrant independent
clinical attention. Stimulant intoxication delirium would be
distinguished by a disturbance in level of awareness and change in
cognition.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p614}Stimulant Withdrawal

**569**

Other mental disorders.

Salient mental disturbances associated with stimulant intoxication
should be distinguished from the symptoms of schizophrenia, paranoid
type; bipolar and depressive disorders; generalized anxiety disorder;
and panic disorder as described in DSM-5.

Stimulant Withdrawal

Diagnostic Criteria

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) prolonged amphetamine-type substance,
cocaine, or other stimulant use.

B. Dysphoric mood and two (or more) of the following physiological
changes, developing within a few hours to several days after Criterion
A: 1. Fatigue.

2\. Vivid, unpleasant dreams.

3\. Insomnia or hypersomnia.

4\. Increased appetite.

5\. Psychomotor retardation or agitation.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

*Specify* **the specific substance that causes the withdrawal syndrome**
(i.e., amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant).

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.0.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or other
stimulant. The ICD-10-CM code for amphetamine or an other stimulant
withdrawal is **F15.23,** and the ICD-10-CM for cocaine withdrawal is
**F14.23.** Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence
of a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use
disorder, reflecting the fact that amphetamine, cocaine, or other
stimulant withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or
severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder.

It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild amphetamine, cocaine, or
other stimulant use disorder with amphetamine, cocaine, or other
stimulant withdrawal.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of stimulant withdrawal is the presence of a
characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops within a few hours to
several days after the cessation of (or marked reduction in) stimulant
use (generally high dose) that has been prolonged (Criterion A). The
withdrawal syndrome is characterized by the development of dysphoric
mood accompanied by two or more of the following physiological changes:
fatigue, vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased
appetite, and psychomotor retardation or agitation (Criterion B).
Bradycardia is often present and is a reliable measure of stimulant
withdrawal.

Anhedonia and drug craving can often be present but are not part of the
diagnostic criteria. These symptoms cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to
another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder (Criterion D).

[]{#index_split_067.html#p615}**570**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Acute withdrawal symptoms ("a crash") are often seen after periods of
repetitive high-dose use ("runs" or "binges"). These periods are
characterized by intense and unpleasant feelings of lassitude and
depression and increased appetite, generally requiring several days of
rest and recuperation. Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or
behavior can occur and are generally the most serious problems seen
during "crashing" or other forms of stimulant withdrawal. The majority
of individuals with stimulant use disorder experience a withdrawal
syndrome at some point, and virtually all individuals with the disorder
report tolerance.

Differential Diagnosis

Stimulant use disorder and other stimulant-induced disorders.

Stimulant withdrawal

is distinguished from stimulant use disorder and from the other
stimulant-induced disorders (e.g., stimulant-induced intoxication
delirium, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder,
anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorder) because the
symptoms of withdrawal predominate the clinical presentation and are
severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.

**Other Stimulant-Induced Disorders**

The following stimulant-induced disorders (which include amphetamine-,
cocaine-, and other stimulant--induced disorders) are described in other
chapters of the manual with disorders with which they share
phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in
these chapters): stimulant-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia
Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders"); stimulant-induced bipolar
disorder ("Bipolar and Related Disorders"); stimulant-induced depressive
disorder ("Depressive Disorders"); stimulant-induced anxiety disorder
("Anxiety Disorders"); stimulant-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder
("Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders"); stimulant-induced sleep
disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"); and stimulant-induced sexual
dysfunction ("Sexual Dysfunctions"). For stimulant intoxication
delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter
"Neurocognitive Disorders." These stimulant-induced disorders are
diagnosed instead of stimulant intoxication or stimulant withdrawal only
when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent
clinical attention.

Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a stimulant-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific stimulant-related disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.9.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or another
stimulant. The ICD-10-CM code for an unspecified amphetamine-or other
stimulant-related disorder is **F15.99.** The ICD-10-CM code for an
unspecified cocaine-related disorder is **F14.99.**

Tobacco Use Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. A problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period: 1. Tobacco is often taken
in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.

2\. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control tobacco use.

3\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain or
use tobacco.

4\. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco.

5\. Recurrent tobacco use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., interference with work).

6\. Continued tobacco use despite having persistent or recurrent social
or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of
tobacco (e.g., arguments with others about tobacco use).

7\. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of tobacco use.

8\. Recurrent tobacco use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous (e.g., smoking in bed).

9\. Tobacco use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or
recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been
caused or exacerbated by tobacco.

10\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of tobacco to achieve the desired effect.

b\. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount
of tobacco.

11\. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The
characteristic withdrawal syndrome for tobacco (refer to Criteria A and
B of the criteria set for tobacco withdrawal).

b\. Tobacco (or a closely related substance, such as nicotine) is taken
to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

*Specify* if:

**In early remission:** After full criteria for tobacco use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for tobacco use disorder have
been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
tobacco," may be met).

**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for tobacco use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for tobacco use disorder have
been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
tobacco," may be met).

[]{#index_split_067.html#p617}**572**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

*Specify* if:

**On maintenance therapy:** The individual is taking a long-term
maintenance medication, such as nicotine replacement medication, and no
criteria for tobacco use disorder have been met for that class of
medication (except tolerance to, or withdrawal from, the nicotine
replacement medication).

**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to tobacco is
restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a
tobacco withdrawal or tobacco-induced sleep disorder is also present, do
not use the codes below for tobacco use disorder. Instead, the comorbid
tobacco use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the
tobacco-induced disorder code (see the coding note for tobacco
withdrawal or tobacco-induced sleep disorder). For example, if there is
comorbid tobacco-induced sleep disorder and tobacco use disorder, only
the tobacco-induced sleep disorder code is given, with the 4th character
indicating whether the comorbid tobacco use disorder is moderate or
severe: F17.208

for moderate or severe tobacco use disorder with tobacco-induced sleep
disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use
disorder with a tobacco-induced sleep disorder.

*Specify* current severity:

**305.1 (Z72.0) Mild:** Presence of 2--3 symptoms.

**305.1 (F17.200) Moderate:** Presence of 4--5 symptoms.

**305.1 (F17.200) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers

"On maintenance therapy" applies as a further specifier to individuals
being maintained on other tobacco cessation medication (e.g., bupropion,
varenicline) and as a further specifier of remission if the individual
is both in remission and on maintenance therapy. "In a controlled
environment" applies as a further specifier of remission if the
individual is both in remission and in a controlled environment (i.e.,
in early remission in a controlled environment or in sustained remission
in a controlled environment). Examples of these environments are closely
supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked
hospital units.

Diagnostic Features

Tobacco use disorder is common among individuals who use cigarettes and
smokeless tobacco daily and is uncommon among individuals who do not use
tobacco daily or who use nicotine medications. Tolerance to tobacco is
exemplified by the disappearance of nausea and dizziness after repeated
intake and with a more intense effect of tobacco the first time it is
used during the day. Cessation of tobacco use can produce a well-defined
withdrawal syndrome. Many individuals with tobacco use disorder use
tobacco to relieve or to avoid withdrawal symptoms (e.g., after being in
a situation where use is restricted). Many individuals who use tobacco
have tobacco-related physical symptoms or diseases and continue to
smoke. The large majority report craving when they do not smoke for
several hours.

Spending excessive time using tobacco can be exemplified by
chain-smoking (i.e., smoking one cigarette after another with no time
between cigarettes). Because tobacco sources are readily and legally
available, and because nicotine intoxication is very rare, spending a
great deal of time attempting to procure tobacco or recovering from its
effects is uncommon. Giving up important social, occupational, or
recreational activities can occur when an individual forgoes an activity
because it occurs in tobacco use--restricted areas. Use of tobacco
rarely results in failure to fulfill major role obligations (e.g.,
interference with work, interference with home obligations), but
persistent social or interpersonal problems (e.g., having arguments with
others about tobacco use, avoiding social situations because of others'
disapproval of tobacco use) or use that is physically hazardous (e.g.,
smoking in []{#index_split_067.html#p618}Tobacco Use Disorder

**573**

bed, smoking around flammable chemicals) occur at an intermediate
prevalence. Although these criteria are less often endorsed by tobacco
users, if endorsed, they can indicate a more severe disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Smoking within 30 minutes of waking, smoking daily, smoking more
cigarettes per day, and waking at night to smoke are associated with
tobacco use disorder. Environmental cues can evoke craving and
withdrawal. Serious medical conditions, such as lung and other cancers,
cardiac and pulmonary disease, perinatal problems, cough, shortness of
breath, and accelerated skin aging, often occur.

Prevalence

Cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product, representing over
90% of tobacco/nicotine use. In the United States, 57% of adults have
never been smokers, 22% are former smokers, and 21% are current smokers.
Approximately 20% of current U.S. smokers are nondaily smokers. The
prevalence of smokeless tobacco use is less than 5%, and the prevalence
of tobacco use in pipes and cigars is less than 1%.

DSM-IV nicotine dependence criteria can be used to estimate the
prevalence of tobacco use disorder, but since they are a subset of
tobacco use disorder criteria, the prevalence of tobacco use disorder
will be somewhat greater. The 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV nicotine
dependence in the United States is 13% among adults age 18 years and
older. Rates are similar among adult males (14%) and females (12%) and
decline in age from 17%

among 18-to 29-year-olds to 4% among individuals age 65 years and older.
The prevalence of current nicotine dependence is greater among Native
American and Alaska Natives (23%) than among whites (14%) but is less
among African Americans (10%), Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
(6%), and Hispanics (6%). The prevalence among current daily smokers is
approximately 50%.

In many developing nations, the prevalence of smoking is much greater in
males than in females, but this is not the case in developed nations.
However, there often is a lag in the demographic transition such that
smoking increases in females at a later time.

Development and Course

The majority of U.S. adolescents experiment with tobacco use, and by age
18 years, about 20% smoke at least monthly. Most of these individuals
become daily tobacco users. Initiation of smoking after age 21 years is
rare. In general, some of the tobacco use disorder criteria symptoms
occur soon after beginning tobacco use, and many individuals' pattern of
use meets current tobacco use disorder criteria by late adolescence.
More than 80% of individuals who use tobacco attempt to quit at some
time, but 60% relapse within 1 week and less than 5% remain abstinent
for life. However, most individuals who use tobacco make multiple
attempts such that one-half of tobacco users eventually abstain.
Individuals who use tobacco who do quit usually do not do so until after
age 30 years. Although nondaily smoking in the United States was
previously rare, it has become more prevalent in the last decade,
especially among younger individuals who use tobacco.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Individuals with externalizing personality traits are more likely to
initiate tobacco use. Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder or conduct disorder, and adults with depressive, bipolar,
anxiety, personality, psychotic, or other substance use disorders, are
at higher risk of starting and continuing tobacco use and of tobacco use
disorder.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p619}**574**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Environmental.

Individuals with low incomes and low educational levels are more likely
to initiate tobacco use and are less likely to stop.

Genetic and physiological.

Genetic factors contribute to the onset of tobacco use, the continuation
of tobacco use, and the development of tobacco use disorder, with a
degree of heritability equivalent to that observed with other substance
use disorders (i.e., about 50%). Some of this risk is specific to
tobacco, and some is common with the vulnerability to developing any
substance use disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Cultures and subcultures vary widely in their acceptance of the use of
tobacco. The prevalence of tobacco use declined in the United States
from the 1960s through the 1990s, but this decrease has been less
evident in African American and Hispanic populations. Also, smoking in
developing countries is more prevalent than in developed nations. The
degree to which these cultural differences are due to income, education,
and tobacco control activities in a country is unclear. Non-Hispanic
white smokers appear to be more likely to develop tobacco use disorder
than are smokers. Some ethnic differences may be biologically based.
African American males tend to have higher nicotine blood levels for a
given number of cigarettes, and this might contribute to greater
difficulty in quitting. Also, the speed of nicotine metabolism is
significantly different for whites compared with African Americans and
can vary by genotypes associated with ethnicities.

Diagnostic Markers

Carbon monoxide in the breath, and nicotine and its metabolite cotinine
in blood, saliva, or urine, can be used to measure the extent of current
tobacco or nicotine use; however, these are only weakly related to
tobacco use disorder.

Functional Consequences of Tobacco Use Disorder

Medical consequences of tobacco use often begin when tobacco users are
in their 40s and usually become progressively more debilitating over
time. One-half of smokers who do not stop using tobacco will die early
from a tobacco-related illness, and smoking-related morbidity occurs in
more than one-half of tobacco users. Most medical conditions result from
exposure to carbon monoxide, tars, and other non-nicotine components of
tobacco.

The major predictor of reversibility is duration of smoking. Secondhand
smoke increases the risk of heart disease and cancer by 30%. Long-term
use of nicotine medications does not appear to cause medical harm.

Comorbidity

The most common medical diseases from smoking are cardiovascular
illnesses, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancers. Smoking
also increases perinatal problems, such as low birth weight and
miscarriage. The most common psychiatric comorbidities are
alcohol/substance, depressive, bipolar, anxiety, personality, and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders. In individuals with current
tobacco use disorder, the prevalence of current alcohol, drug, anxiety,
depressive, bipolar, and personality disorders ranges from 22% to 32%.
Nicotine-dependent smokers are 2.7--8.1 times more likely to have these
disorders than nondependent smokers, never-smokers, or ex-smokers.

**575**

Tobacco Withdrawal

Diagnostic Criteria

**292.0 (F17.203)**

A. Daily use of tobacco for at least several weeks.

B. Abrupt cessation of tobacco use, or reduction in the amount of
tobacco used, followed within 24 hours by four (or more) of the
following signs or symptoms: 1. Irritability, frustration, or anger.

2\. Anxiety.

3\. Difficulty concentrating.

4\. Increased appetite.

5\. Restlessness.

6\. Depressed mood.

7\. Insomnia.

C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

D. The signs or symptoms are not attributed to another medical condition
and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including
intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for
tobacco withdrawal is F17.203. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates
the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe tobacco use disorder,
reflecting the fact that tobacco withdrawal can only occur in the
presence of a moderate or severe tobacco use disorder. It is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder with tobacco
withdrawal.

Diagnostic Features

Withdrawal symptoms impair the ability to stop tobacco use. The symptoms
after abstinence from tobacco are in large part due to nicotine
deprivation. Symptoms are much more intense among individuals who smoke
cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco than among those who use nicotine
medications. This difference in symptom intensity is likely due to the
more rapid onset and higher levels of nicotine with cigarette smoking.
Tobacco withdrawal is common among daily tobacco users who stop or
reduce but can also occur among nondaily users. Typically, heart rate
decreases by 5--12 beats per minute in the first few days after stopping
smoking, and weight increases an average of 4--7 lb (2--3 kg) over the
first year after stopping smoking. Tobacco withdrawal can produce
clinically significant mood changes and functional impairment.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Craving for sweet or sugary foods and impaired performance on tasks
requiring vigilance are associated with tobacco withdrawal. Abstinence
can increase constipation, coughing, dizziness, dreaming/nightmares,
nausea, and sore throat. Smoking increases the metabolism of many
medications used to treat mental disorders; thus, cessation of smoking
can increase the blood levels of these medications, and this can produce
clinically significant outcomes. This effect appears to be due not to
nicotine but rather to other compounds in tobacco.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p621}**576**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Prevalence

Approximately 50% of tobacco users who quit for 2 or more days will have
symptoms that meet criteria for tobacco withdrawal. The most commonly
endorsed signs and symptoms are anxiety, irritability, and difficulty
concentrating. The least commonly endorsed symptoms are depression and
insomnia.

Development and Course

Tobacco withdrawal usually begins within 24 hours of stopping or cutting
down on tobacco use, peaks at 2--3 days after abstinence, and lasts 2--3
weeks. Tobacco withdrawal symptoms can occur among adolescent tobacco
users, even prior to daily tobacco use. Prolonged symptoms beyond 1
month are uncommon.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Smokers with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other substance use
disorders have more severe withdrawal.

Genetic and physiological.

Genotype can influence the probability of withdrawal upon abstinence.

Diagnostic Markers

Carbon monoxide in the breath, and nicotine and its metabolite cotinine
in blood, saliva, or urine, can be used to measure the extent of tobacco
or nicotine use but are only weakly related to tobacco withdrawal.

Functional Consequences of Tobacco Withdrawal

Abstinence from cigarettes can cause clinically significant distress.
Withdrawal impairs the ability to stop or control tobacco use. Whether
tobacco withdrawal can prompt a new mental disorder or recurrence of a
mental disorder is debatable, but if this occurs, it would be in a small
minority of tobacco users.

Differential Diagnosis

The symptoms of tobacco withdrawal overlap with those of other substance
withdrawal syndromes (e.g., alcohol withdrawal; sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal; stimulant withdrawal; caffeine withdrawal; opioid
withdrawal); caffeine intoxication; anxiety, depressive, bipolar, and
sleep disorders; and medication-induced akathisia. Admission to
smoke-free inpatient units or voluntary smoking cessation can induce
withdrawal symptoms that mimic, intensify, or disguise other disorders
or adverse effects of medications used to treat mental disorders (e.g.,
irritability thought to be due to alcohol withdrawal could be due to
tobacco withdrawal). Reduction in symptoms with the use of nicotine
medications confirms the diagnosis.

**Other Tobacco-Induced Disorders**

Tobacco-induced sleep disorder is discussed in the chapter "Sleep-Wake
Disorders" (see

"Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder").

[]{#index_split_067.html#p622}Unspecified Tobacco-Related Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

A. A problematic pattern of use of an intoxicating substance not able to
be classified within the alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogen
(phencyclidine and others); inhalant; opioid; sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic; stimulant; or tobacco categories and leading to clinically

2\. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control use of the substance.

3\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the
substance, use the substance, or recover from its effects.

4\. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance.

5\. Recurrent use of the substance resulting in a failure to fulfill
major role obligations at work, school, or home.

6\. Continued use of the substance despite having persistent or
recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the
effects of its use.

7\. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of use of the substance.

8\. Recurrent use of the substance in situations in which it is
physically hazardous.

9\. Use of the substance is continued despite knowledge of having a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely
to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p623}**578**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

10\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or
desired effect.

b\. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount
of the substance.

11\. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The
characteristic withdrawal syndrome for other (or unknown) substance
(refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria sets for other \[or unknown\]
substance withdrawal, p. 583).

b\. The substance (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve
or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

*Specify* if:

**In early remission:** After full criteria for other (or unknown)
substance use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for
other (or unknown) substance use disorder have been met for at least 3
months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion
A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance," may be
met).

**In sustained remission:** After full criteria for other (or unknown)
substance use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for
other (or unknown) substance use disorder have been met at any time
during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that
Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the
substance,"

may be met).

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This additional specifier is used if
the individual is in an environment where access to the substance is
restricted.

**Coding based on current severity:** Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an
other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or unknown) substance
withdrawal, or another other (or unknown) substance--induced mental
disorder is present, do not use the codes below for other (or unknown)
substance use disorder. Instead, the comorbid other (or unknown)
substance use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the other
(or unknown) substance--induced disorder code (see the coding note for
other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or unknown) substance
withdrawal, or specific other (or unknown) substance--induced mental
disorder).

For example, if there is comorbid other (or unknown) substance--induced
depressive disorder and other (or unknown) substance use disorder, only
the other (or unknown) substance--

induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character
indicating whether the comorbid other (or unknown) substance use
disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F19.14 for other (or unknown)
substance use disorder with other (or unknown) substance--induced
depressive disorder or F19.24 for a moderate or severe other (or
unknown) substance use disorder with other (or unknown)
substance--induced depressive disorder.

*Specify* current severity:

**305.90 (F19.10) Mild:** Presence of 2--3 symptoms.

**304.90 (F19.20) Moderate:** Presence of 4--5 symptoms.

**304.90 (F19.20) Severe:** Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers

"In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier of
remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p624}Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder
**579**

Diagnostic Features

The diagnostic class other (or unknown) substance use and related
disorders comprises substance-related disorders unrelated to alcohol;
caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (phencyclidine and others); inhalants;
opioids; sedative, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants (including
amphetamine and cocaine); or tobacco. Such substances include anabolic
steroids; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; cortisol;
antiparkinsonian medications; antihistamines; nitrous oxide; amyl-,
butyl-, or isobutylnitrites; betel nut, which is chewed in many cultures
to produce mild euphoria and a floating sensation; kava (from a South
Pacific pepper plant), which produces sedation, incoordination, weight
loss, mild hepatitis, and lung abnormalities; or cathinones (including
*khât* plant agents and synthetic chemical derivatives) that produce
stimulant effects. Unknown substance-related disorders are associated
with unidentified substances, such as intoxications in which the
individual cannot identify the ingested drug, or substance use disorders
involving either new, black market drugs not yet identified or familiar
drugs illegally sold under false names.

Other (or unknown) substance use disorder is a mental disorder in which
repeated use of an other or unknown substance typically continues,
despite the individual's knowing that the substance is causing serious
problems for the individual. Those problems are reflected in the
diagnostic criteria. When the substance is known, it should be reflected
in the name of the disorder upon coding (e.g., nitrous oxide use
disorder).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A diagnosis of other (or unknown) substance use disorder is supported by
the individual's statement that the substance involved is not among the
nine classes listed in this chapter; by recurring episodes of
intoxication with negative results in standard drug screens (which may
not detect new or rarely used substances); or by the presence of
symptoms characteristic of an unidentified substance that has newly
appeared in the individual's community.

Because of increased access to nitrous oxide ("laughing gas"),
membership in certain populations is associated with diagnosis of
nitrous oxide use disorder. The role of this gas as an anesthetic agent
leads to misuse by some medical and dental professionals. Its use as a
propellant for commercial products (e.g., whipped cream dispensers)
contributes to misuse by food service workers. With recent widespread
availability of the substance in "whippet" cartridges for use in home
whipped cream dispensers, nitrous oxide misuse by adolescents and young
adults is significant, especially among those who also inhale volatile
hydrocarbons. Some continuously using individuals, inhaling from as many
as 240

whippets per day, may present with serious medical complications and
mental conditions, including myeloneuropathy, spinal cord subacute
combined degeneration, peripheral neuropathy, and psychosis. These
conditions are also associated with a diagnosis of nitrous oxide use
disorder.

Use of amyl-, butyl-, and isobutyl nitrite gases has been observed among
homosexual men and some adolescents, especially those with conduct
disorder. Membership in these populations may be associated with a
diagnosis of amyl-, butyl-, or isobutylnitrite use disorder. However, it
has not been determined that these substances produce a substance use
disorder. Despite tolerance, these gases may not alter behavior through
central effects, and they may be used only for their peripheral effects.

Substance use disorders generally are associated with elevated risks of
suicide, but there is no evidence of unique risk factors for suicide
with other (or unknown) substance use disorder.

Prevalence

Based on extremely limited data, the prevalence of other (or unknown)
substance use disorder is likely lower than that of use disorders
involving the nine substance classes in this chapter.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p625}**580**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Development and Course

No single pattern of development or course characterizes the
pharmacologically varied other (or unknown) substance use disorders.
Often unknown substance use disorders will be reclassified when the
unknown substance eventually is identified.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Risk and prognostic factors for other (or unknown) substance use
disorders are thought to be similar to those for most substance use
disorders and include the presence of any other substance use disorders,
conduct disorder, or antisocial personality disorder in the individual
or the individual's family; early onset of substance problems; easy
availability of the substance in the individual's environment; childhood
maltreatment or trauma; and evidence of limited early self-control and
behavioral disinhibition.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Certain cultures may be associated with other (or unknown) substance use
disorders involving specific indigenous substances within the cultural
region, such as betel nut.

Diagnostic Markers

Urine, breath, or saliva tests may correctly identify a commonly used
substance falsely sold as a novel product. However, routine clinical
tests usually cannot identify truly unusual or new substances, which may
require testing in specialized laboratories.

Differential Diagnosis

Use of other or unknown substances without meeting criteria for other
(or unknown) substance use disorder.

Use of unknown substances is not rare among adolescents, but most use
does not meet the diagnostic standard of two or more criteria for other
(or unknown) substance use disorder in the past year.

Substance use disorders.

Other (or unknown) substance use disorder may co-occur with various
substance use disorders, and the symptoms of the disorders may be
similar and overlapping. To disentangle symptom patterns, it is helpful
to inquire about which symptoms persisted during periods when some of
the substances were not being used.

Other (or unknown) substance/medication-induced disorder.

This diagnosis should

be differentiated from instances when the individual's symptoms meet
full criteria for one of the following disorders, and that disorder is
caused by an other or unknown substance: delirium, major or mild
neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder, depressive disorder,
anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, or sleep disorder.

Other medical conditions.

Individuals with substance use disorders, including other (or unknown)
substance use disorder, may present with symptoms of many medical
disorders. These disorders also may occur in the absence of other (or
unknown) substance use disorder. A history of little or no use of other
or unknown substances helps to exclude other (or unknown) substance use
disorder as the source of these problems.

Comorbidity

Substance use disorders, including other (or unknown) substance use
disorder, are commonly comorbid with one another, with adolescent
conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder, and with
suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p626}Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication
**581**

Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication

Diagnostic Criteria

A. The development of a reversible substance-specific syndrome
attributable to recent ingestion of (or exposure to) a substance that is
not listed elsewhere or is unknown.

B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes that are attributable to the effect of the substance on the
central nervous system (e.g., impaired motor coordination, psychomotor
agitation or retardation, euphoria, anxiety, belligerence, mood
lability, cognitive impairment, impaired judgment, social withdrawal)
and develop during, or shortly after, use of the substance.

C. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is **292.89.** The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid other (or unknown) substance use
disorder involving the same substance. If a mild other (or unknown)
substance use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM

code is **F19.129,** and if a moderate or severe other (or unknown)
substance use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is **F19.229.**
If there is no comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder
involving the same substance, then the ICD-10-CM code is **F19.929.**

**Note:** For information on Risk and Prognostic Factors,
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues, and Diagnostic Markers, see the
corresponding sections in other (or unknown) substance use disorder.

Diagnostic Features

Other (or unknown) substance intoxication is a clinically significant
mental disorder that develops during, or immediately after, use of
either a) a substance not elsewhere addressed in this chapter (i.e.,
alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; phencyclidine and other hallucinogens;
inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; or
tobacco) or b) an unknown substance. If the substance is known, it
should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding.

Application of the diagnostic criteria for other (or unknown) substance
intoxication is very challenging. Criterion A requires development of a
reversible "substance-specific syndrome," but if the substance is
unknown, that syndrome usually will be unknown. To resolve this
conflict, clinicians may ask the individual or obtain collateral history
as to whether the individual has experienced a similar episode after
using substances with the same "street" name or from the same source.
Similarly, hospital emergency departments sometimes recognize over a few
days numerous presentations of a severe, unfamiliar intoxication
syndrome from a newly available, previously unknown substance. Because
of the great variety of intoxicating substances, Criterion B can provide
only broad examples of signs and symptoms from some intoxications, with
no threshold for the number of symptoms required for a diagnosis;
clinical judgment guides those decisions. Criterion C

requires ruling out other medical conditions, mental disorders, or
intoxications.

Prevalence

The prevalence of other (or unknown) substance intoxication is unknown.

Development and Course

Intoxications usually appear and then peak minutes to hours after use of
the substance, but the onset and course vary with the substance and the
route of administration. Generally,

[]{#index_split_067.html#p627}**582**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

substances used by pulmonary inhalation and intravenous injection have
the most rapid onset of action, while those ingested by mouth and
requiring metabolism to an active product are much slower. (For example,
after ingestion of certain mushrooms, the first signs of an eventually
fatal intoxication may not appear for a few days.) Intoxication effects
usually resolve within hours to a very few days. However, the body may
completely eliminate an anesthetic gas such as nitrous oxide just
minutes after use ends. At the other extreme, some "hit-and-run"
intoxicating substances poison systems, leaving permanent impairments.
For example, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), a
contaminating by-product in the synthesis of a certain opioid, kills
dopaminergic cells and induces permanent parkinsonism in users who
sought opioid intoxication.

Functional Consequences of

Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication

Impairment from intoxication with any substance may have serious
consequences, including dysfunction at work, social indiscretions,
problems in interpersonal relationships, failure to fulfill role
obligations, traffic accidents, fighting, high-risk behaviors (i.e.,
having unprotected sex), and substance or medication overdose. The
pattern of consequences will vary with the particular substance.

Differential Diagnosis

Use of other or unknown substance, without meeting criteria for other
(or unknown) substance intoxication.

The individual used an other or unknown substance(s), but the dose was
insufficient to produce symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria
required for the diagnosis.

Substance intoxication or other substance/medication-induced disorders.

Familiar substances may be sold in the black market as novel products,
and individuals may experience intoxication from those substances.
History, toxicology screens, or chemical testing of the substance itself
may help to identify it.

Different types of other (or unknown) substance--related disorders.

Episodes of other

(or unknown) substance intoxication may occur during, but are distinct
from, other (or unknown) substance use disorder, unspecified other (or
unknown) substance--related disorder, and other (or unknown)
substance--induced disorders.

Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, vascular, or infectious
disorders that impair brain function and cognition.

Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may produce rapid
onset of signs and symptoms mimicking those of intoxications, including
the examples in Criterion B. Paradoxically, drug withdrawals also must
be ruled out, because, for example, lethargy may indicate withdrawal
from one drug or intoxication with another drug.

Comorbidity

As with all substance-related disorders, adolescent conduct disorder,
adult antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use disorders
tend to co-occur with other (or unknown) substance intoxication.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p628}Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal
**583**

Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal

Diagnostic Criteria

**292.0 (F19.239)**

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) use of a substance that has been heavy
and prolonged.

B. The development of a substance-specific syndrome shortly after the
cessation of (or reduction in) substance use.

C. The substance-specific syndrome causes clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and
are not better explained by another mental disorder, including
withdrawal from another substance.

E. The substance involved cannot be classified under any of the other
substance categories (alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; or tobacco) or is unknown.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for
other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is F19.239. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe
other (or unknown) substance use disorder. It is not permissible to code
a comorbid mild other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or
unknown) substance withdrawal.

**Note:** For information on Risk and Prognostic Factors and Diagnostic
Markers, see the corresponding sections in other (or unknown) substance
use disorder.

Diagnostic Features

Other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is a clinically significant
mental disorder that develops during, or within a few hours to days
after, reducing or terminating dosing with a substance (Criteria A and
B). Although recent dose reduction or termination usually is clear in
the history, other diagnostic procedures are very challenging if the
drug is unknown. Criterion B requires development of a
"substance-specific syndrome" (i.e., the individual's signs and symptoms
must correspond with the known withdrawal syndrome for the recently
stopped drug)---a requirement that rarely can be met with an unknown
substance. Consequently, clinical judgment must guide such decisions
when information is this limited. Criterion D requires ruling out other
medical conditions, mental disorders, or withdrawals from familiar
substances. When the substance is known, it should be reflected in the
name of the disorder upon coding (e.g., betel nut withdrawal).

Prevalence

The prevalence of other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is unknown.

Development and Course

Withdrawal signs commonly appear some hours after use of the substance
is terminated, but the onset and course vary greatly, depending on the
dose typically used by the person and the rate of elimination of the
specific substance from the body. At peak severity, withdrawal symptoms
from some substances involve only moderate levels of discomfort, whereas
withdrawal from other substances may be fatal. Withdrawal-associated
dysphoria often motivates relapse to substance use. Withdrawal symptoms
slowly abate over days, weeks, or months, depending on the particular
drug and doses to which the individual became tolerant.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Culture-related issues in diagnosis will vary with the particular
substance.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p629}**584**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

Functional Consequences of

Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal

Withdrawal from any substance may have serious consequences, including
physical signs and symptoms (e.g., malaise, vital sign changes,
abdominal distress, headache), intense drug craving, anxiety,
depression, agitation, psychotic symptoms, or cognitive impairments.

These consequences may lead to problems such as dysfunction at work,
problems in interpersonal relationships, failure to fulfill role
obligations, traffic accidents, fighting, high-risk behavior (e.g.,
having unprotected sex), suicide attempts, and substance or medication
overdose. The pattern of consequences will vary with the particular
substance.

Differential Diagnosis

Dose reduction after extended dosing, but not meeting the criteria for
other (or unknown) substance withdrawal.

The individual used other (or unknown) substances,

but the dose that was used was insufficient to produce symptoms that
meet the criteria required for the diagnosis.

Substance withdrawal or other substance/medication-induced disorders.

Familiar

example, lethargy may indicate withdrawal from one drug or intoxication
with another drug.

Comorbidity

As with all substance-related disorders, adolescent conduct disorder,
adult antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use disorders
likely co-occur with other (or unknown) substance withdrawal.

**Other (or Unknown)**

**Substance--Induced Disorders**

Because the category of other or unknown substances is inherently
ill-defined, the extent and range of induced disorders are uncertain.
Nevertheless, other (or unknown) substance--induced disorders are
possible and are described in other chapters of the manual with
disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): other
(or unknown) substance--induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia
Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders"); other (or unknown
substance--induced bipolar disorder ("Bipolar and Related Disorders");
other (or unknown) substance--induced depressive disorder ("Depressive
Disorders"); other (or unknown) substance--induced anxiety disorders
("Anxiety Disorders"); other (or unknown) substance--induced
obsessive-compulsive disorder ("Obsessive-Compulsive and Related
Disorders"); other (or unknown) substance--induced sleep disorder

Disorders"); other (or unknown) substance--induced sexual dysfunction
("Sexual Dysfunctions"); and other (or unknown)
substance/medication--induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder
("Neurocognitive Disorders"). For other (or unknown) substance--

induced intoxication delirium and other (or unknown) substance--induced
withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the
chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders." These other (or unknown)
substance--induced disorders are diagnosed instead of other (or unknown)
substance intoxication or other (or unknown) substance withdrawal only
when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent
clinical attention.

the desired excitement.

2\. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop
gambling.

3\. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop
gambling.

4\. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts
of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next
venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble).

5\. Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty,
anxious, depressed).

6\. After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even
("chasing" one's losses).

7\. Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling.

8\. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or
educational or career opportunity because of gambling.

9\. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial

**Severe:** 8--9 criteria met.

**Note:** Although some behavioral conditions that do not involve
ingestion of substances have similarities to substance-related
disorders, only one disorder---gambling disorder---

has sufficient data to be included in this section.

Specifiers

Severity is based on the number of criteria endorsed. Individuals with
mild gambling disorder may exhibit only 4--5 of the criteria, with the
most frequently endorsed criteria usually related to preoccupation with
gambling and "chasing" losses. Individuals with moderately severe
gambling disorder exhibit more of the criteria (i.e., 6--7). Individuals
with the most severe form will exhibit all or most of the nine criteria
(i.e., 8--9). Jeopardizing relationships or career opportunities due to
gambling and relying on others to provide money for gambling losses are
typically the least often endorsed criteria and most often occur among
those with more severe gambling disorder. Furthermore, individuals
presenting for treatment of gambling disorder typically have moderate to
severe forms of the disorder.

Diagnostic Features

Gambling involves risking something of value in the hopes of obtaining
something of greater value. In many cultures, individuals gamble on
games and events, and most do so without experiencing problems. However,
some individuals develop substantial impairment related to their
gambling behaviors. The essential feature of gambling disorder is
persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behavior that disrupts
personal, family, and/or vocational pursuits (Criterion A). Gambling
disorder is defined as a cluster of four or more of the symptoms listed
in Criterion A occurring at any time in the same 12-month period.

A pattern of "chasing one's losses" may develop, with an urgent need to
keep gambling (often with the placing of larger bets or the taking of
greater risks) to undo a loss or series of losses. The individual may
abandon his or her gambling strategy and try to win back losses all at
once. Although many gamblers may "chase" for short periods of time, it
is the frequent, and often long-term, "chase" that is characteristic of
gambling disorder (Criterion A6). Individuals may lie to family members,
therapists, or others to conceal the extent of involvement with
gambling; these instances of deceit may also include, but are not
limited to, covering up illegal behaviors such as forgery, fraud, theft,
or embez-zlement to obtain money with which to gamble (Criterion A7).
Individuals may also en-

gage in "bailout" behavior, turning to family or others for help with a
desperate financial situation that was caused by gambling (Criterion
A9).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Distortions in thinking (e.g., denial, superstitions, a sense of power
and control over the outcome of chance events, overconfidence) may be
present in individuals with gambling disorder. Many individuals with
gambling disorder believe that money is both the cause of and the
solution to their problems. Some individuals with gambling disorder are
impulsive, competitive, energetic, restless, and easily bored; they may
be overly concerned with the approval of others and may be generous to
the point of extravagance when win-ning. Other individuals with gambling
disorder are depressed and lonely, and they may gamble when feeling
helpless, guilty, or depressed. Up to half of individuals in treatment
for gambling disorder have suicidal ideation, and about 17% have
attempted suicide.

Prevalence

The past-year prevalence rate of gambling disorder is about 0.2%--0.3%
in the general population. In the general population, the lifetime
prevalence rate is about 0.4%--1.0%. For females, the lifetime
prevalence rate of gambling disorder is about 0.2%, and for males it is
about 0.6%. The lifetime prevalence of pathological gambling among
African Americans is about 0.9%, among whites about 0.4%, and among
Hispanics about 0.3%.

Development and Course

The onset of gambling disorder can occur during adolescence or young
adulthood, but in other individuals it manifests during middle or even
older adulthood. Generally, gambling disorder develops over the course
of years, although the progression appears to be more rapid in females
than in males. Most individuals who develop a gambling disorder evidence
a pattern of gambling that gradually increases in both frequency and
amount of wagering. Certainly, milder forms can develop into more severe
cases. Most individuals with gambling disorder report that one or two
types of gambling are most problematic for them, although some
individuals participate in many forms of gambling. Individuals are
likely to engage in certain types of gambling (e.g., buying scratch
tickets daily) more frequently than others (e.g., playing slot machines
or blackjack at the casino weekly). Frequency of gambling can be related
more to the type of gambling than to the severity of the overall
gambling disorder. For example, purchasing a single scratch ticket each
day may not be problematic, while less frequent casino, sports, or card
gambling may be part of a gambling disorder. Similarly, amounts of money
spent wagering are not in themselves indicative of gambling disorder.
Some individuals can wager thousands of dollars per month and not have a
problem with gambling, while others may wager much smaller amounts but
experience substantial gambling-related difficulties.

Gambling patterns may be regular or episodic, and gambling disorder can
be persistent or in remission. Gambling can increase during periods of
stress or depression and during periods of substance use or abstinence.
There may be periods of heavy gambling and severe problems, times of
total abstinence, and periods of nonproblematic gambling.

Gambling disorder is sometimes associated with spontaneous, long-term
remissions.

Nevertheless, some individuals underestimate their vulnerability to
develop gambling disorder or to return to gambling disorder following
remission. When in a period of remission, they may incorrectly assume
that they will have no problem regulating gambling and that they may
gamble on some forms nonproblematically, only to experience a return to
gambling disorder.

Early expression of gambling disorder is more common among males than
among females. Individuals who begin gambling in youth often do so with
family members or

[]{#index_split_067.html#p633}**588**

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

friends. Development of early-life gambling disorder appears to be
associated with impulsivity and substance abuse. Many high school and
college students who develop gambling disorder grow out of the disorder
over time, although it remains a lifelong problem for some. Mid-and
later-life onset of gambling disorder is more common among females than
among males.

There are age and gender variations in the type of gambling activities
and the prevalence rates of gambling disorder. Gambling disorder is more
common among younger and middle-age persons than among older adults.
Among adolescents and young adults, the disorder is more prevalent in
males than in females. Younger individuals prefer different forms of
gambling (e.g., sports betting), while older adults are more likely to
develop problems with slot machine and bingo gambling. Although the
proportions of individuals who seek treatment for gambling disorder are
low across all age groups, younger individuals are especially unlikely
to present for treatment.

Males are more likely to begin gambling earlier in life and to have a
younger age at onset of gambling disorder than females, who are more
likely to begin gambling later in life and to develop gambling disorder
in a shorter time frame. Females with gambling disorder are more likely
than males with gambling disorder to have depressive, bipolar, and
anxiety disorders. Females also have a later age at onset of the
disorder and seek treatment sooner, although rates of treatment seeking
are low (\<10%) among individuals with gambling disorder regardless of
gender.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Gambling that begins in childhood or early adolescence is associated
with increased rates of gambling disorder. Gambling disorder also
appears to aggregate with antisocial personality disorder, depressive
and bipolar disorders, and other substance use disorders, particularly
with alcohol disorders.

Genetic and physiological.

Gambling disorder can aggregate in families, and this effect appears to
relate to both environmental and genetic factors. Gambling problems are
more frequent in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins. Gambling disorder
is also more prevalent among first-degree relatives of individuals with
moderate to severe alcohol use disorder than among the general
population.

Course modifiers.

Many individuals, including adolescents and young adults, are likely to
resolve their problems with gambling disorder over time, although a
strong predictor of future gambling problems is prior gambling problems.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Individuals from specific cultures and races/ethnicities are more likely
to participate in some types of gambling activities than others (e.g.,
pai gow, cockfights, blackjack, horse racing). Prevalence rates of
gambling disorder are higher among African Americans than among European
Americans, with rates for Hispanic Americans similar to those of
European Americans. Indigenous populations have high prevalence rates of
gambling disorder.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Males develop gambling disorder at higher rates than females, although
this gender gap may be narrowing. Males tend to wager on different forms
of gambling than females, with cards, sports, and horse race gambling
more prevalent among males, and slot machine and bingo gambling more
common among females.

Functional Consequences of Gambling Disorder

Areas of psychosocial, health, and mental health functioning may be
adversely affected by gambling disorder. Specifically, individuals with
gambling disorder may, because of their involvement with gambling,
jeopardize or lose important relationships with family members or
friends. Such problems may occur from repeatedly lying to others to
cover up the extent of gambling or from requesting money that is used
for gambling or to pay off gambling debts. Employment or educational
activities may likewise be adversely impacted by gambling disorder;
absenteeism or poor work or school performance can occur with gambling
disorder, as individuals may gamble during work or school hours or be
preoccupied with gambling or its adverse consequence when they should be
working or studying. Individuals with gambling disorder have poor
general health and utilize medical services at high rates.

Differential Diagnosis

Nondisordered gambling.

Gambling disorder must be distinguished from professional and social
gambling. In professional gambling, risks are limited and discipline is
central.

Social gambling typically occurs with friends or colleagues and lasts
for a limited period of time, with acceptable losses. Some individuals
can experience problems associated with gambling (e.g., short-term
chasing behavior and loss of control) that do not meet the full criteria
for gambling disorder.

Manic episode.

Loss of judgment and excessive gambling may occur during a manic
episode. An additional diagnosis of gambling disorder should be given
only if the gambling behavior is not better explained by manic episodes
(e.g., a history of maladaptive gambling behavior at times other than
during a manic episode). Alternatively, an individual with gambling
disorder may, during a period of gambling, exhibit behavior that
resembles a manic episode, but once the individual is away from the
gambling, these manic-like features dissipate.

Personality disorders.

Problems with gambling may occur in individuals with antisocial
personality disorder and other personality disorders. If the criteria
are met for both disorders, both can be diagnosed.

Other medical conditions.

Some patients taking dopaminergic medications (e.g., for Parkinson's
disease) may experience urges to gamble. If such symptoms dissipate when
dopaminergic medications are reduced in dosage or ceased, then a
diagnosis of gambling disorder would not be indicated.

Comorbidity

Gambling disorder is associated with poor general health. In addition,
some specific medical diagnoses, such as tachycardia and angina, are
more common among individuals with gambling disorder than in the general
population, even when other substance use disorders, including tobacco
use disorder, are controlled for. Individuals with gambling disorder
have high rates of comorbidity with other mental disorders, such as
substance use disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and
personality disorders. In some individuals, other mental disorders may
precede gambling disorder and be either absent or present during the
manifestation of gambling disorder. Gambling disorder may also occur
prior to the onset of other mental disorders, especially anxiety
disorders and substance use disorders.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p635} *This page intentionally left blank*

[]{#index_split_067.html#p636}**Neurocognitive**

**Disorders**

The neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) (referred to in DSM-IV as "Dementia,
Delirium, Amnestic, and Other Cognitive Disorders") begin with delirium,
followed by the syndromes of major NCD, mild NCD, and their etiological
subtypes. The major or mild NCD subtypes are NCD due to Alzheimer's
disease; vascular NCD; NCD with Lewy bodies; NCD due to Parkinson's
disease; frontotemporal NCD; NCD due to traumatic brain injury; NCD due
to HIV infection; substance/medication-induced NCD; NCD due to
Huntington's disease; NCD due to prion disease; NCD due to another
medical condition; NCD due to multiple etiologies; and unspecified NCD.
The NCD category encompasses the group of disorders in which the primary
clinical deficit is in cognitive function, and that are acquired rather
than developmental. Although cognitive deficits are present in many if
not all mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorders), only
disorders whose core features are cognitive are included in the NCD
category. The NCDs are those in which impaired cognition has not been
present since birth or very early life, and thus represents a decline
from a previously attained level of functioning.

The NCDs are unique among DSM-5 categories in that these are syndromes
for which the underlying pathology, and frequently the etiology as well,
can potentially be determined. The various underlying disease entities
have all been the subject of extensive research, clinical experience,
and expert consensus on diagnostic criteria. The DSM-5 criteria for
these disorders have been developed in close consultation with the
expert groups for each of the disease entities and align as closely as
possible with the current consensus criteria for each of them. The
potential utility of biomarkers is also discussed in relation to
diagnosis. Dementia is subsumed under the newly named entity *major
neurocognitive disorder*, although the term *dementia* is not precluded
from use in the etiological subtypes in which that term is standard.
Furthermore, DSM-5 recognizes a less severe level of cognitive
impairment, *mild neurocognitive disorder,* which can also be a focus of
care, and which in DSM-IV was subsumed under "Cognitive Disorder Not
Otherwise Specified." Diagnostic criteria are provided for both these
syndromic entities, followed by diagnostic criteria for the different
etiological subtypes. Several of the NCDs frequently coexist with one
another, and their relationships may be multiply characterized under
different chapter subheadings, including "Differential Diagnosis" (e.g.,
NCD due to Alzheimer's disease vs.

vascular NCD), "Risk and Prognostic Factors" (e.g., vascular pathology
increasing the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease), and/or
"Comorbidity" (e.g., mixed Alzheimer's disease--vascular pathology).

The term *dementia* is retained in DSM-5 for continuity and may be used
in settings where physicians and patients are accustomed to this term.
Although dementia is the cus-tomary term for disorders like the
degenerative dementias that usually affect older adults, the term
*neurocognitive disorder* is widely used and often preferred for
conditions affecting younger individuals, such as impairment secondary
to traumatic brain injury or HIV

infection. Furthermore, the major NCD definition is somewhat broader
than the term *dementia,* in that individuals with substantial decline
in a single domain can receive this diagnosis, most notably the DSM-IV
category of "Amnestic Disorder," which would now be diagnosed as major
NCD due to another medical condition and for which the term *dementia*
would not be used.

Neurocognitive Disorders

Neurocognitive Domains

The criteria for the various NCDs are all based on defined cognitive
domains. Table 1 provides for each of the key domains a working
definition, examples of symptoms or observations regarding impairments
in everyday activities, and examples of assessments. The domains thus
defined, along with guidelines for clinical thresholds, form the basis
on which the NCDs, their levels, and their subtypes may be diagnosed.

Neurocognitive Disorders

Delirium

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. A disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus,
sustain, and shift attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to the
environment).

B. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours
to a few days), represents a change from baseline attention and
awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of a
day.

C. An additional disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit,
disorientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception).

D. The disturbances in Criteria A and C are not better explained by
another preexisting, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder
and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced level of arousal,
such as coma.

E. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct physiological
consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or
withdrawal (i.e., due to a drug of abuse or to a medication), or
exposure to a toxin, or is due to multiple etiologies.

*Specify* whether:

**Substance intoxication delirium:** This diagnosis should be made
instead of substance intoxication when the symptoms in Criteria A and C
predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently
severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance\] intoxication delirium are indicated in the table below. Note
that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid
substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a
mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance intoxication
delirium, the 4th position character is "1," and the clinician should
record "mild \[substance\] use disorder" before the substance
intoxication delirium (e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine
intoxication delirium"). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder
is comorbid with the substance intoxication delirium, the 4th position
character is "2," and the clinician should record "moderate
\[substance\] use disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder,"
depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time
heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is "9," and
the clinician should record only the substance intoxication delirium.

**Medication-induced delirium:** This diagnosis applies when the
symptoms in Criteria A and C arise as a side effect of a medication
taken as prescribed.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for \[specific medication\]-induced
delirium is **292.81.** The ICD-10-CM code depends on the type of
medication. If the medication is an opioid taken as prescribed, the code
is **F11.921.** If the medication is a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
taken as prescribed, the code is **F13.921.** If the medication is an
amphetamine-type or other stimulant taken as prescribed, the code is
**F15.921.** For medications that do not fit into any of the classes
(e.g., dexamethasone) and in cases in which a substance is judged to be
an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown,
the code is **F19.921.**

**293.0 (F05) Delirium due to another medical condition:** There is
evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings
that the disturbance is attributable to the physiological consequences
of another medical condition.

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition in the
name of the delirium (e.g., 293.0 \[F05\] delirium due to hepatic
encephalopathy). The other medical condition should also be coded and
listed separately immediately before the delirium due to another medical
condition (e.g., 572.2 \[K72.90\] hepatic encephalopathy; 293.0 \[F05\]
delirium due to hepatic encephalopathy).

**293.0 (F05) Delirium due to multiple etiologies:** There is evidence
from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the
delirium has more than one etiology (e.g., more than one etiological
medical condition; another medical condition plus substance intoxication
or medication side effect).

**Coding note:** Use multiple separate codes reflecting specific
delirium etiologies (e.g., 572.2 \[K72.90\] hepatic encephalopathy,
293.0 \[F05\] delirium due to hepatic failure; 291.0 \[F10.231\] alcohol
withdrawal delirium). Note that the etiological medical condition both
appears as a separate code that precedes the delirium code and is
substituted into the delirium due to another medical condition rubric.

Neurocognitive Disorders

*Specify* if:

**Hyperactive:** The individual has a hyperactive level of psychomotor
activity that may be accompanied by mood lability, agitation, and/or
refusal to cooperate with medical care.

**Hypoactive:** The individual has a hypoactive level of psychomotor
activity that may be accompanied by sluggishness and lethargy that
approaches stupor.

**Mixed level of activity:** The individual has a normal level of
psychomotor activity even though attention and awareness are disturbed.
Also includes individuals whose activity level rapidly fluctuates.

Recording Procedures

Substance intoxication delirium

***ICD-9-CM.*** The name of the substance/medication intoxication
delirium begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine,
dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delirium. The
diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set,
which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into
any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for "other substance"
should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an
etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the
category "unknown substance" should be used.

The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute,
persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor
activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity).
Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the
substance/medication intoxication delirium and substance use disorder
into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for
the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of acute
hyperactive intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe
cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.81 cocaine intoxication
delirium, acute, hyperactive. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe
cocaine use disorder is also given. If the intoxication delirium occurs
without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy
use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted
(e.g., 292.81 phencyclidine intoxication delirium, acute, hypoactive).

***ICD-10-CM.***

The name of the substance/medication intoxication delirium begins with
the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed
to be causing the delirium.

The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria
set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a
comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any
of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for "other substance"
should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an
etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the
category "unknown substance" should be used.

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the substance intoxication delirium, followed by the
course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating
level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed
level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive
intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe cocaine use
disorder, the diagnosis is F14.221 severe cocaine use disorder with
cocaine intoxication delirium, acute, hyperactive. A separate diagnosis
of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the
intoxication delirium occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder
(e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying
substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.921 phencyclidine
intoxication delirium, acute, hypoactive).

Substance withdrawal delirium

***ICD-9-CM.*** The name of the substance/medication withdrawal delirium
begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to
be causing the withdrawal delirium. The diagnostic code is selected from
substance-specific codes included in the coding note included

[]{#index_split_067.html#p644}Delirium

**599**

in the criteria set. The name of the disorder is followed by the course
(i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of
psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of
activity). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine
the substance/medication withdrawal delirium and substance use disorder
into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for
the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of acute
hyperactive withdrawal delirium occurring in a man with a severe alcohol
use disorder, the diagnosis is 291.0 alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute,
hyperactive. An additional diagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use
disorder is also given.

***ICD-10-CM.***

The name of the substance/medication withdrawal delirium begins with the
specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the
withdrawal delirium. The diagnostic code is selected from
substance-specific codes included in the coding note included in the
criteria set. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid
moderate or severe substance use disorder (if any) is listed first,
followed by the word

"with," followed by the substance withdrawal delirium, followed by the
course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating
level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed
level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive
withdrawal delirium occurring in a man with a severe alcohol use
disorder, the diagnosis is F10.231 severe alcohol use disorder with
alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute, hyperactive. A separate diagnosis of
the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given.

Medication-induced delirium.

The name of the medication-induced delirium begins

with the specific substance (e.g., dexamethasone) that is presumed to be
causing the delirium. The name of the disorder is followed by the course
(i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of
psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of
activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive
medication-induced delirium occurring in a man using dexamethasone as
prescribed, the diagnosis is 292.81

(F19.921) dexamethasone-induced delirium, acute, hyperactive.

Specifiers

Regarding course, in hospital settings, delirium usually lasts about 1
week, but some symptoms often persist even after individuals are
discharged from the hospital.

Individuals with delirium may rapidly switch between hyperactive and
hypoactive states. The hyperactive state may be more common or more
frequently recognized and often is associated with medication side
effects and drug withdrawal. The hypoactive state may be more frequent
in older adults.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of delirium is a disturbance of attention or
awareness that is accompanied by a change in baseline cognition that
cannot be better explained by a preexisting or evolving neurocognitive
disorder (NCD). The disturbance in attention (Criterion A) is manifested
by reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention.
Questions must be repeated because the individual's attention wanders,
or the individual may perseverate with an answer to a previous question
rather than appropriately shift attention. The individual is easily
distracted by irrelevant stimuli. The disturbance in awareness is
manifested by a reduced orientation to the environment or at times even
to oneself.

The disturbance develops over a short period of time, usually hours to a
few days, and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day, often
with worsening in the evening and night when external orienting stimuli
decrease (Criterion B). There is evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a
physiological consequence of an underlying medical condition, substance
intoxication or withdrawal, use of a medication, or a toxin exposure, or
a combination of these factors (Criterion E). The etiology should be
coded according to the etiologically appropriate subtype (i.e.,
substance or medication intoxication, substance withdrawal, another
medical []{#index_split_067.html#p645}**600**

Neurocognitive Disorders

condition, or multiple etiologies). Delirium often occurs in the context
of an underlying NCD. The impaired brain function of individuals with
mild and major NCD renders them more vulnerable to delirium.

There is an accompanying change in at least one other area that may
include memory and learning (particularly recent memory), disorientation
(particularly to time and place), alteration in language, or perceptual
distortion or a perceptual-motor disturbance (Criterion C). The
perceptual disturbances accompanying delirium include
misinterpretations, illusions, or hallucinations; these disturbances are
typically visual, but may occur in other modalities as well, and range
from simple and uniform to highly complex. Normal attention/arousal,
delirium, and coma lie on a continuum, with coma defined as the lack of
any response to verbal stimuli. The ability to evaluate cognition to
diagnose delirium depends on there being a level of arousal sufficient
for response to verbal stimulation; hence, delirium should not be
diagnosed in the context of coma (Criterion D). Many noncomatose
patients have a reduced level of arousal. Those patients who show only
minimal responses to verbal stimulation are incapable of engaging with
attempts at standardized testing or even interview. This inability to
engage should be classified as severe inattention. Low-arousal states
(of acute onset) should be recognized as indicating severe inattention
and cognitive change, and hence delirium. They are clinically
indistinguishable from delirium diagnosed on the basis of inattention or
cognitive change elicited through cognitive testing and interview.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Delirium is often associated with a disturbance in the sleep-wake cycle.
This disturbance can include daytime sleepiness, nighttime agitation,
difficulty falling asleep, excessive sleepiness throughout the day, or
wakefulness throughout the night. In some cases, complete reversal of
the night-day sleep-wake cycle can occur. Sleep-wake cycle disturbances
are very common in delirium and have been proposed as a core criterion
for the diagnosis.

The individual with delirium may exhibit emotional disturbances, such as
anxiety, fear, depression, irritability, anger, euphoria, and apathy.
There may be rapid and unpredictable shifts from one emotional state to
another. The disturbed emotional state may also be evident in calling
out, screaming, cursing, muttering, moaning, or making other sounds.
These behaviors are especially prevalent at night and under conditions
in which stimulation and environmental cues are lacking.

Prevalence

The prevalence of delirium is highest among hospitalized older
individuals and varies depending on the individuals' characteristics,
setting of care, and sensitivity of the detection method. The prevalence
of delirium in the community overall is low (1%--2%) but increases with
age, rising to 14% among individuals older than 85 years. The prevalence
is 10%--30% in older individuals presenting to emergency departments,
where the delirium often indicates a medical illness.

The prevalence of delirium when individuals are admitted to the hospital
ranges from 14% to 24%, and estimates of the incidence of delirium
arising during hospitalization range from 6% to 56% in general hospital
populations. Delirium occurs in 15%--53% of older individuals
postoperatively and in 70%--87% of those in intensive care. Delirium
occurs in up to 60% of individuals in nursing homes or post--acute care
settings and in up to 83% of all individuals at the end of life.

Development and Course

While the majority of individuals with delirium have a full recovery
with or without treatment, early recognition and intervention usually
shortens the duration of the delir-

[]{#index_split_067.html#p646}Delirium

**601**

ium. Delirium may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, or death,
particularly if the underlying cause remains untreated. Mortality among
hospitalized individuals with delirium is high, and as many as 40% of
individuals with delirium, particularly those with malignancies and
other significant underlying medical illness, die within a year after
diagnosis.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Delirium may be increased in the context of functional impairment,
immobility, a history of falls, low levels of activity, and use of drugs
and medications with psychoactive properties (particularly alcohol and
anticholinergics).

Genetic and physiological.

Both major and mild NCDs can increase the risk for delirium and
complicate the course. Older individuals are especially susceptible to
delirium compared with younger adults. Susceptibility to delirium in
infancy and through childhood may be greater than in early and middle
adulthood. In childhood, delirium may be related to febrile illnesses
and certain medications (e.g., anticholinergics).

Diagnostic Markers

In addition to laboratory findings characteristic of underlying medical
conditions (or intoxication or withdrawal states), there is often
generalized slowing on electroencephalography, and fast activity is
occasionally found (e.g., in some cases of alcohol withdrawal delirium).
However, electroencephalography is insufficiently sensitive and specific
for diagnostic use.

Functional Consequences of Delirium

Delirium itself is associated with increased functional decline and risk
of institutional placement. Hospitalized individuals 65 years or older
with delirium have three times the risk of nursing home placement and
about three times the functional decline as hospitalized patients
without delirium at both discharge and 3 months postdischarge.

Differential Diagnosis

Psychotic disorders and bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic
features.

Delirium that is characterized by vivid hallucinations, delusions,
language disturbances, and agitation must be distinguished from brief
psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and other
psychotic disorders, as well as from bipolar and depressive disorders
with psychotic features.

Acute stress disorder.

Delirium associated with fear, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, such
as depersonalization, must be distinguished from acute stress disorder,
which is precipitated by exposure to a severely traumatic event.

Malingering and factitious disorder.

Delirium can be distinguished from these disorders on the basis of the
often atypical presentation in malingering and factitious disorder and
the absence of another medical condition or substance that is
etiologically related to the apparent cognitive disturbance.

Other neurocognitive disorders.

The most common differential diagnostic issue when

evaluating confusion in older adults is disentangling symptoms of
delirium and dementia.

The clinician must determine whether the individual has delirium; a
delirium superimposed on a preexisting NCD, such as that due to
Alzheimer's disease; or an NCD without delirium. The traditional
distinction between delirium and dementia according to acute-ness of
onset and temporal course is particularly difficult in those elderly
individuals who had a prior NCD that may not have been recognized, or
who develop persistent cognitive impairment following an episode of
delirium.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p647}**602**

Neurocognitive Disorders

Other Specified Delirium

**780.09 (R41.0)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of delirium that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
predominate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium or any of the
disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified delirium category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does
not meet the criteria for delirium or any specific neurocognitive
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified delirium" followed
by the specific reason (e.g., "attenuated delirium syndrome").

An example of a presentation that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation is the following:

**Attenuated delirium syndrome:** This syndrome applies in cases of
delirium in which the severity of cognitive impairment falls short of
that required for the diagnosis, or in which some, but not all,
diagnostic criteria for delirium are met.

Unspecified Delirium

**780.09 (R41.0)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of delirium that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
predominate but do not meet the full criteria for delirium or any of the
disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified delirium category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for delirium, and includes presentations for which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

Subtypes

Major and mild neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) are primarily subtyped
according to the known or presumed etiological/pathological entity or
entities underlying the cognitive decline. These subtypes are
distinguished on the basis of a combination of time course,
characteristic domains affected, and associated symptoms. For certain
etiological subtypes, the diagnosis depends substantially on the
presence of a potentially causative entity, such as Parkinson's or
Huntington's disease, or a traumatic brain injury or stroke in the
appropriate time period. For other etiological subtypes (generally the
neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal
lobar degeneration, and Lewy body disease), the diagnosis is based
primarily on the cognitive, behavioral, and functional symptoms.
Typically, the differentiation among these syndromes that lack an
independently recognized etiological entity is clearer at the level of
major NCD than at the level of mild NCD, but sometimes characteristic
symptoms and associated features are present at the mild level as well.

NCDs are frequently managed by clinicians in multiple disciplines. For
many subtypes, multidisciplinary international expert groups have
developed specialized consensus criteria based on clinicopathological
correlation with underlying brain pathology. The subtype criteria here
have been harmonized with those expert criteria.

Specifiers

Evidence for distinct behavioral features in NCDs has been recognized,
particularly in the areas of psychotic symptoms and depression.
Psychotic features are common in many NCDs, particularly at the
mild-to-moderate stage of major NCDs due to Alzheimer's disease, Lewy
body disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Paranoia and other
delusions are common features, and often a persecutory theme may be a
prominent aspect of delusional ideation. In contrast to psychotic
disorders with onset in earlier life (e.g., schizophrenia), disorganized
speech and disorganized behavior are not characteristic of psychosis in
NCDs. Hallucinations may occur in any modality, although visual
hallucinations are more common in NCDs than in depressive, bipolar, or
psychotic disorders.

Mood disturbances, including depression, anxiety, and elation, may
occur. Depression is common early in the course (including at the mild
NCD level) of NCD due to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease,
while elation may occur more commonly in frontotemporal lobar
degeneration. When a full affective syndrome meeting diagnostic criteria
for a depressive or bipolar disorder is present, that diagnosis should
be coded as well.

Mood symptoms are increasingly recognized to be a significant feature in
the earliest stages of mild NCDs such that clinical recognition and
intervention may be important.

Agitation is common in a wide variety of NCDs, particularly in major NCD
of moderate to severe severity, and often occurs in the setting of
confusion or frustration. It may arise as combative behaviors,
particularly in the context of resisting caregiving duties such as
bathing and dressing. Agitation is characterized as disruptive motor or
vocal activity and tends to occur with advanced stages of cognitive
impairment across all of the NCDs.

Individuals with NCD can present with a wide variety of behavioral
symptoms that are the focus of treatment. Sleep disturbance is a common
symptom that can create a need for clinical attention and may include
symptoms of insomnia, hypersomnia, and circadian rhythm disturbances.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p652}Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders
**607**

Apathy is common in mild and mild major NCD. It is observed particularly
in NCD due to Alzheimer's disease and may be a prominent feature of NCD
due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Apathy is typically
characterized by diminished motivation and reduced goal-directed
behavior accompanied by decreased emotional responsiveness.

Symptoms of apathy may manifest early in the course of NCDs when a loss
of motivation to pursue daily activities or hobbies may be observed.

Other important behavioral symptoms include wandering, disinhibition,
hyperphagia, and hoarding. Some of these symptoms are characteristic of
specific disorders, as discussed in the relevant sections. When more
than one behavioral disturbance is observed, each type should be noted
in writing with the specifier "with behavioral symptoms."

Diagnostic Features

Major and mild NCDs exist on a spectrum of cognitive and functional
impairment. Major NCD corresponds to the condition referred to in DSM-IV
as *dementia,* retained as an alternative in this volume. The core
feature of NCDs is acquired cognitive decline in one or more cognitive
domains (Criterion A) based on both 1) a concern about cognition on the
part of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician, and
2) performance on an objective assessment that falls below the expected
level or that has been observed to decline over time. Both a concern and
objective evidence are required because they are complementary. When
there is an exclusive focus on objective testing, a disorder may go
undiagnosed in high-functioning individuals whose currently "normal"
performance actually represents a substantial decline in abilities, or
an illness may be incorrectly diagnosed in individuals whose currently
"low" performance does not represent a change from their own baseline or
is a result of extraneous factors like test conditions or a passing
illness. Alternatively, excessive focus on subjective symptoms may fail
to diagnose illness in individuals with poor insight, or whose
informants deny or fail to notice their symptoms, or it may be overly
sensitive in the so-called worried well.

A cognitive concern differs from a complaint in that it may or may not
be voiced spontaneously. Rather, it may need to be elicited by careful
questioning about specific symptoms that commonly occur in individuals
with cognitive deficits (see Table 1 in the introduction to this
chapter). For example, memory concerns include difficulty remembering a
short grocery list or keeping track of the plot of a television program;
executive concerns include difficulty resuming a task when interrupted,
organizing tax records, or planning a holiday meal. At the mild NCD
level, the individual is likely to describe these tasks as being more
difficult or as requiring extra time or effort or compensatory
strategies.

At the major NCD level, such tasks may only be completed with assistance
or may be abandoned altogether. At the mild NCD level, individuals and
their families may not notice such symptoms or may view them as normal,
particularly in the elderly; thus, careful history taking is of
paramount importance. The difficulties must represent changes rather
than lifelong patterns: the individual or informant may clarify this
issue, or the clinician can infer change from prior experience with the
patient or from occupational or other clues. It is also critical to
determine that the difficulties are related to cognitive loss rather
than to motor or sensory limitations.

Neuropsychological testing, with performance compared with norms
appropriate to the patient's age, educational attainment, and cultural
background, is part of the standard evaluation of NCDs and is
particularly critical in the evaluation of mild NCD. For major NCD,
performance is typically 2 or more standard deviations below appropriate
norms (3rd percentile or below). For mild NCD, performance typically
lies in the 1--2 standard deviation range (between the 3rd and 16th
percentiles). However, neuropsychological testing is not available in
all settings, and neuropsychological thresholds are sensitive to the
specific test(s) and norms employed, as well as to test conditions,
sensory limitations, and intercurrent illness. A variety of brief
office-based or "bedside" assessments, as described
[]{#index_split_067.html#p653}**608**

Neurocognitive Disorders

in Table 1, can also supply objective data in settings where such
testing is unavailable or infeasible. In any case, as with cognitive
concerns, objective performance must be interpreted in light of the
individual's prior performance. Optimally, this information would be
available from a prior administration of the same test, but often it
must be inferred based on appropriate norms, along with the individual's
educational history, occupation, and other factors. Norms are more
challenging to interpret in individuals with very high or very low
levels of education and in individuals being tested outside their own
language or cultural background.

Criterion B relates to the individual's level of independence in
everyday functioning.

Individuals with major NCD will have impairment of sufficient severity
so as to interfere with independence, such that others will have to take
over tasks that the individuals were previously able to complete on
their own. Individuals with mild NCD will have preserved independence,
although there may be subtle interference with function or a report that
tasks require more effort or take more time than previously.

The distinction between major and mild NCD is inherently arbitrary, and
the disorders exist along a continuum. Precise thresholds are therefore
difficult to determine. Careful history taking, observation, and
integration with other findings are required, and the implications of
diagnosis should be considered when an individual's clinical
manifestations lie at a boundary.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Typically the associated features that support a diagnosis of major or
mild NCD will be specific to the etiological subtype (e.g., neuroleptic
sensitivity and visual hallucinations in NCD due to Lewy body disease).
Diagnostic features specific to each of the subtypes are found in the
relevant sections.

Prevalence

The prevalence of NCD varies widely by age and by etiological subtype.
Overall prevalence estimates are generally only available for older
populations. Among individuals older than 60 years, prevalence increases
steeply with age, so prevalence estimates are more accurate for narrow
age bands than for broad categories such as "over 65" (where the mean
age can vary greatly with the life expectancy of the given population).
For those etiological subtypes occurring across the lifespan, prevalence
estimates for NCD are likely to be available, if at all, only as the
fraction of individuals who develop NCD among those with the relevant
condition (e.g., traumatic brain injury, HIV infection).

Overall prevalence estimates for dementia (which is largely congruent
with major NCD) are approximately 1%--2% at age 65 years and as high as
30% by age 85 years. The prevalence of mild NCD is very sensitive to the
definition of the disorder, particularly in community settings, where
evaluations are less detailed. In addition, in contrast with clinical
settings, where cognitive concern must be high to seek and locate care,
there may be a less clear decline from baseline functioning. Estimates
of the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (which is substantially
congruent with mild NCD) among older individuals are fairly variable,
ranging from 2% to 10% at age 65 and 5% to 25% by age 85.

Development and Course

The course of NCD varies across etiological subtypes, and this variation
can be useful in differential diagnosis. Some subtypes (e.g., those
related to traumatic brain injury or stroke) typically begin at a
specific time and (at least after initial symptoms related to
inflammation or swelling subside) remain static. Others may fluctuate
over time (although if this occurs, the possibility of delirium
superimposed on NCD should be considered).

NCDs due to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease or
frontotemporal lobar degeneration typically are marked by insidious
onset and gradual progression, and

[]{#index_split_067.html#p654}Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders
**609**

the pattern of onset of cognitive deficits and associated features helps
to distinguish among them.

NCDs with onset in childhood and adolescence may have broad
repercussions for social and intellectual development, and in this
setting intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)
and/or other neurodevelopmental disorders may also be diagnosed to
capture the full diagnostic picture and ensure the provision of a broad
range of services. In older individuals, NCDs often occur in the setting
of medical illnesses, frailty, and sensory loss, which complicate the
clinical picture for diagnosis and treatment.

When cognitive loss occurs in youth to midlife, individuals and families
are likely to seek care. NCDs are typically easiest to identify at
younger ages, although in some settings malingering or other factitious
disorders may be a concern. Very late in life, cognitive symptoms may
not cause concern or may go unnoticed. In late life, mild NCD must also
be distinguished from the more modest deficits associated with "normal
aging," although a substantial fraction of what has been ascribed to
normal aging likely represents prodromal phases of various NCDs. In
addition, it becomes harder to recognize mild NCD with age because of
the increasing prevalence of medical illness and sensory deficits. It
becomes harder to differentiate among subtypes with age because there
are multiple potential sources of neurocognitive decline.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Risk factors vary not only by etiological subtype but also by age at
onset within etiological subtypes. Some subtypes are distributed
throughout the lifespan, whereas others occur exclusively or primarily
in late life. Even within the NCDs of aging, the relative prevalence
varies with age: Alzheimer's disease is uncommon before age 60 years,
and the prevalence increases steeply thereafter, while the overall less
common frontotemporal lobar degeneration has earlier onset and
represents a progressively smaller fraction of NCDs with age.

Genetic and physiological.

The strongest risk factor for major and mild NCDs is age, primarily
because age increases the risk of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular
disease. Female gender is associated with higher prevalence of dementia
overall, and especially Alzheimer's disease, but this difference is
largely, if not wholly, attributable to greater lon-gevity in females.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Individuals' and families' level of awareness and concern about
neurocognitive symptoms may vary across ethnic and occupational groups.
Neurocognitive symptoms are more likely to be noticed, particularly at
the mild level, in individuals who engage in complex occupational,
domestic, or recreational activities. In addition, norms for
neuropsychological testing tend to be available only for broad
populations, and thus they may not be easily applicable to individuals
with less than high school education or those being evaluated outside
their primary language or culture.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Like age, culture, and occupation, gender issues may affect the level of
concern and awareness of cognitive symptoms. In addition, for late-life
NCDs, females are likely to be older, to have more medical comorbidity,
and to live alone, which can complicate evaluation and treatment. In
addition, there are gender differences in the frequency of some of the
etiological subtypes.

Diagnostic Markers

In addition to a careful history, neuropsychological assessments are the
key measures for diagnosis of NCDs, particularly at the mild level,
where functional changes are minimal

[]{#index_split_067.html#p655}**610**

Neurocognitive Disorders

and symptoms more subtle. Ideally, individuals will be referred for
formal neuropsychological testing, which will provide a quantitative
assessment of all relevant domains and thus help with diagnosis; provide
guidance to the family on areas where the individual may require more
support; and serve as a benchmark for further decline or response to
therapies. When such testing is unavailable or not feasible, the brief
assessments in Table 1

can provide insight into each domain. More global brief mental status
tests may be helpful but may be insensitive, particularly to modest
changes in a single domain or in those with high premorbid abilities,
and may be overly sensitive in those with low premorbid abilities.

In distinguishing among etiological subtypes, additional diagnostic
markers may come into play, particularly neuroimaging studies such as
magnetic resonance imaging scans and positron emission tomography scans.
In addition, specific markers may be involved in the assessment of
specific subtypes and may become more important as additional research
findings accumulate over time, as discussed in the relevant sections.

Functional Consequences of

Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders

By definition, major and mild NCDs affect functioning, given the central
role of cognition in human life. Thus, the criteria for the disorders,
and the threshold for differentiating mild from major NCD, are based in
part on functional assessment. Within major NCD there is a broad range
of functional impairment, as implemented in the severity specifiers. In
addition, the specific functions that are compromised can help identify
the cognitive domains affected, particularly when neuropsychological
testing is not available or is difficult to interpret.

Differential Diagnosis

Normal cognition.

The differential diagnosis between normal cognition and mild NCD, as
between mild and major NCD, is challenging because the boundaries are
inherently arbitrary. Careful history taking and objective assessment
are critical to these distinctions. A longitudinal evaluation using
quantified assessments may be key in detecting mild NCD.

Delirium.

Both mild and major NCD may be difficult to distinguish from a
persistent delirium, which can co-occur. Careful assessment of attention
and arousal will help to make the distinction.

Major depressive disorder.

The distinction between mild NCD and major depressive disorder, which
may co-occur with NCD, can also be challenging. Specific patterns of
cognitive deficits may be helpful. For example, consistent memory and
executive function deficits are typical of Alzheimer's disease, whereas
nonspecific or more variable performance is seen in major depression.
Alternatively, treatment of the depressive disorder with repeated
observation over time may be required to make the diagnosis.

Specific learning disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

A careful clarification of the individual's baseline status will help
distinguish an NCD from a specific learning disorder or other
neurodevelopmental disorders. Additional issues may enter the
differential for specific etiological subtypes, as described in the
relevant sections.

Comorbidity

NCDs are common in older individuals and thus often co-occur with a wide
variety of age-related diseases that may complicate diagnosis or
treatment. Most notable of these is delirium, for which NCD increases
the risk. In older individuals, a delirium during hospitalization is, in
many cases, the first time that an NCD is noticed, although a careful
history will often reveal evidence of earlier decline. Mixed NCDs are
also common in older individuals, as many etiological entities increase
in prevalence with age. In younger individuals, NCD often co-occurs with
neurodevelopmental disorders; for example, a head in-

[]{#index_split_067.html#p656}Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due
to Alzheimer's Disease **611**

jury in a preschool child may also lead to significant developmental and
learning issues.

Additional comorbidity of NCD is often related to the etiological
subtype, as discussed in the relevant sections.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Alzheimer's Disease

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment in one
or more cognitive domains (for major neurocognitive disorder, at least
two domains must be impaired).

C. Criteria are met for either probable or possible Alzheimer's disease
as follows:

***For major neurocognitive disorder:***

**Probable Alzheimer's disease** is diagnosed if either of the following
is present; otherwise, **possible Alzheimer's disease** should be
diagnosed.

1\. Evidence of a causative Alzheimer's disease genetic mutation from
family history or genetic testing.

2\. All three of the following are present:

a\. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning and at least one
other cognitive domain (based on detailed history or serial
neuropsychological testing).

b\. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended
plateaus.

c\. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other
neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or another neurological,
mental, or systemic disease or condition likely contributing to
cognitive decline).

***For mild neurocognitive disorder:***

**Probable Alzheimer's disease** is diagnosed if there is evidence of a
causative Alzheimer's disease genetic mutation from either genetic
testing or family history.

**Possible Alzheimer's disease** is diagnosed if there is no evidence of
a causative Alzheimer's disease genetic mutation from either genetic
testing or family history, and all three of the following are present:

1\. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning.

2\. Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended
plateaus.

3\. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other
neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or another neurological or
systemic disease or condition likely contributing to cognitive decline).

D. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease,
another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or
another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder.

**Coding note:** For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to
Alzheimer's disease, with behavioral disturbance, code first **331.0
(G30.9)** Alzheimer's disease, followed by **294.11 (F02.81)** major

disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be
indicated in writing.)

[]{#index_split_067.html#p657}**612**

Neurocognitive Disorders

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, code
**331.83 (G31.84).**

(**Note:** Do *not* use the additional code for Alzheimer's disease.
Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in
writing.) Diagnostic Features

Beyond the neurocognitive disorder (NCD) syndrome (Criterion A), the
core features of major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease include an
insidious onset and gradual progression of cognitive and behavioral
symptoms (Criterion B). The typical presentation is amnestic (i.e., with
impairment in memory and learning). Unusual nonamnestic presentations,
particularly visuospatial and logopenic aphasic variants, also exist. At
the mild NCD phase, Alzheimer's disease manifests typically with
impairment in memory and learning, sometimes accompanied by deficits in
executive function. At the major NCD phase,
visuoconstructional/perceptual-motor ability and language will also be
impaired, particularly when the NCD is moderate to severe. Social
cognition tends to be preserved until late in the course of the disease.

A level of diagnostic certainty must be specified denoting Alzheimer's
disease as the

"probable" or "possible" etiology (Criterion C). *Probable Alzheimer's
disease* is diagnosed in both major and mild NCD if there is evidence of
a causative Alzheimer's disease gene, either from genetic testing or
from an autosomal dominant family history coupled with autopsy
confirmation or a genetic test in an affected family member. For major
NCD, a typical clinical picture, without extended plateaus or evidence
of mixed etiology, can also be diagnosed as due to probable Alzheimer's
disease. For mild NCD, given the lesser degree of certainty that the
deficits will progress, these features are only sufficient for a
*possible* Alzheimer's etiology. If the etiology appears mixed, mild NCD
due to multiple etiologies should be diagnosed. In any case, for both
mild and major NCD due to Alzheimer's disease, the clinical features
must not suggest another primary etiology for the NCD

(Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

In specialty clinical settings, approximately 80% of individuals with
major NCD due to Alzheimer's disease have behavioral and psychological
manifestations; these features are also frequent at the mild NCD stage
of impairment. These symptoms are as or more distressing than cognitive
manifestations and are frequently the reason that health care is sought.
At the mild NCD stage or the mildest level of major NCD, depression
and/or apathy are often seen. With moderately severe major NCD,
psychotic features, irritability, agitation, combativeness, and
wandering are common. Late in the illness, gait disturbance, dysphagia,
incontinence, myoclonus, and seizures are observed.

Prevalence

The prevalence of overall dementia (major NCD) rises steeply with age.
In high-income countries, it ranges from 5% to 10% in the seventh decade
to at least 25% thereafter. U.S.

census data estimates suggest that approximately 7% of individuals
diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease are between ages 65 and 74 years, 53%
are between ages 75 and 84 years, and 40% are 85 years and older. The
percentage of dementias attributable to Alzheimer's disease ranges from
about 60% to over 90%, depending on the setting and diagnostic criteria.
Mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease is likely to represent a substantial
fraction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well.

Development and Course

Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease progresses gradually,
sometimes with brief plateaus, through severe dementia to death. The
mean duration of survival after di-

[]{#index_split_067.html#p658}Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due
to Alzheimer's Disease **613**

agnosis is approximately 10 years, reflecting the advanced age of the
majority of individuals rather than the course of the disease; some
individuals can live with the disease for as long as 20 years.
Late-stage individuals are eventually mute and bedbound. Death most
commonly results from aspiration in those who survive through the full
course. In mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease, impairments increase
over time, and functional status gradually declines until symptoms reach
the threshold for the diagnosis of major NCD.

The onset of symptoms is usually in the eighth and ninth decades;
early-onset forms seen in the fifth and sixth decades are often related
to known causative mutations. Symptoms and pathology do not differ
markedly at different onset ages. However, younger individuals are more
likely to survive the full course of the disease, while older
individuals are more likely to have numerous medical comorbidities that
affect the course and management of the illness. Diagnostic complexity
is higher in older adults because of the increased likelihood of
comorbid medical illness and mixed pathology.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Traumatic brain injury increases risk for major or mild NCD due to
Alzheimer's disease.

Genetic and physiological.

Age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The genetic
susceptibility polymorphism apolipoprotein E4 increases risk and
decreases age at onset, particularly in homozygous individuals. There
are also extremely rare causative Alzheimer's disease genes. Individuals
with Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) develop Alzheimer's disease if they
survive to midlife. Multiple vascular risk factors influence risk for
Alzheimer's disease and may act by increasing cerebrovascular pathology
or also through direct effects on Alzheimer pathology.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Detection of an NCD may be more difficult in cultural and socioeconomic
settings where memory loss is considered normal in old age, where older
adults face fewer cognitive demands in everyday life, or where very low
educational levels pose greater challenges to objective cognitive
assessment.

Diagnostic Markers

Cortical atrophy, amyloid-predominant neuritic plaques, and
tau-predominant neurofibril-lary tangles are hallmarks of the
pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and may be confirmed via
postmortem histopathological examination. For early-onset cases with
autosomal dominant inheritance, a mutation in one of the known causative
Alzheimer's disease genes---amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin
1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2)--- may be involved, and genetic
testing for such mutations is commercially available, at least for
PSEN1. Apolipoprotein E4 cannot serve as a diagnostic marker because it
is only a risk factor and neither necessary nor sufficient for disease
occurrence.

Since amyloid beta-42 deposition in the brain occurs early in the
pathophysiological cascade, amyloid-based diagnostic tests such as
amyloid imaging on brain positron emission tomography (PET) scans and
reduced levels of amyloid beta-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may
have diagnostic value. Signs of neuronal injury, such as hippocampal and
temporoparietal cortical atrophy on a magnetic resonance image scan,
temporoparietal hypometabolism on a fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan, and
evidence for elevated total tau and phospho-tau levels in CSF, provide
evidence of neuronal damage but are less specific for Alzheimer's
disease. At present, these biomarkers are not fully validated, and many
are available only in tertiary care settings. However, some of them,
along with novel biomarkers, will likely move into wider clinical
practice in the coming years.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p659}**614**

Neurocognitive Disorders

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild

Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease

The prominence of memory loss can cause significant difficulties
relatively early in the course. Social cognition (and thus social
functioning) and procedural memory (e.g., danc-ing, playing musical
instruments) may be relatively preserved for extended periods.

Differential Diagnosis

Other neurocognitive disorders.

Major and mild NCDs due to other neurodegenerative processes (e.g., Lewy
body disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration) share the insidious
onset and gradual decline caused by Alzheimer's disease but have
distinctive core features of their own. In major or mild vascular NCD,
there is typically history of stroke temporally related to the onset of
cognitive impairment, and infarcts or white matter hyperintensities are
judged sufficient to account for the clinical picture. However,
particularly when there is no clear history of stepwise decline, major
or mild vascular NCD can share many clinical features with Alzheimer's
disease.

Other concurrent, active neurological or systemic illness.

Other neurological or systemic illness should be considered if there is
an appropriate temporal relationship and severity to account for the
clinical picture. At the mild NCD level, it may be difficult to
distinguish an Alzheimer's disease etiology from that of another medical
condition (e.g., thyroid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency).

Major depressive disorder.

Particularly at the mild NCD level, the differential diagnosis also
includes major depression. The presence of depression may be associated
with reduced daily functioning and poor concentration that may resemble
an NCD, but improvement with treatment of depression may be useful in
making the distinction.

Comorbidity

Most individuals with Alzheimer's disease are elderly and have multiple
medical conditions that can complicate diagnosis and influence the
clinical course. Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease commonly
co-occurs with cerebrovascular disease, which contributes to the
clinical picture. When a comorbid condition contributes to the NCD in an
individual with Alzheimer's disease, then NCD due to multiple etiologies
should be diagnosed.

Major or Mild Frontotemporal

Neurocognitive Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression.

C. Either (1) or (2):

1\. Behavioral variant:

a\. Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: i. Behavioral
disinhibition.

ii\. Apathy or inertia.

iii\. Loss of sympathy or empathy.

iv\. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior.

v\. Hyperorality and dietary changes.

b\. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p660}Major or Mild Frontotemporal
Neurocognitive Disorder **615**

2\. Language variant:

a\. Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech
production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension.

D. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor
function.

E. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease,
another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or
another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder.

**Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if
either of the following is present; otherwise, **possible frontotemporal
neurocognitive disorder** should be diagnosed:

1\. Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder
genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing.

2\. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe
involvement from neuroimaging.

**Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if
there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not
been performed.

**Coding note:** For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to
frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code
first **331.19 (G31.09)** frontotemporal disease, followed by **294.11
(F02.81)** probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal
lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major
neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration,
without behavioral disturbance, code first **331.19 (G31.09)**
frontotemporal disease, followed by **294.10 (F02.80)** probable major
neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration,
without behavioral disturbance.

For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar
degeneration, code **331.9 (G31.9)** possible major neurocognitive
disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. (**Note:** Do *not*
use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral
disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)
For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar
degeneration, code **331.83**

**(G31.84).** (**Note:** Do *not* use the additional code for
frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but
should still be indicated in writing.) Diagnostic Features

Major or mild frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (NCD) comprises a
number of syndromic variants characterized by the progressive
development of behavioral and personality change and/or language
impairment. The behavioral variant and three language variants
(semantic, agrammatic/nonfluent, and logopenic) exhibit distinct
patterns of brain atrophy and some distinctive neuropathology. The
criteria must be met for either the behavioral or the language variant
to make the diagnosis, but many individuals present with features of
both.

Individuals with behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD
present with varying degrees of apathy or disinhibition. They may lose
interest in socialization, self-care, and personal responsibilities, or
display socially inappropriate behaviors. Insight is usually impaired,
and this often delays medical consultation. The first referral is often
to a psychiatrist. Individuals may develop changes in social style, and
in religious and political beliefs, with repetitive movements, hoarding,
changes in eating behavior, and hyperorality. In later stages, loss of
sphincter control may occur. Cognitive decline is less prominent, and
formal testing may show relatively few deficits in the early stages.
Common neurocognitive symptoms are lack of planning and organization,
distractibility, and poor judgment. Deficits in executive function, such
as poor performance on tests of mental
[]{#index_split_067.html#p661}**616**

Neurocognitive Disorders

flexibility, abstract reasoning, and response inhibition, are present,
but learning and memory are relatively spared, and perceptual-motor
abilities are almost always preserved in the early stages.

Individuals with language-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD
present with primary progressive aphasia with gradual onset, with three
subtypes commonly described: semantic variant, agrammatic/nonfluent
variant, and logopenic variant, and each variant has distinctive
features and corresponding neuropathology.

"Probable" is distinguished from "possible" frontotemporal NCD by the
presence of causative genetic factors (e.g., mutations in the gene
coding for microtubule-associated protein tau) or by the presence of
distinctive atrophy or reduced activity in frontotemporal regions on
structural or functional imaging.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Extrapyramidal features may be prominent in some cases, with an overlap
with syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal
degeneration. Features of motor neuron disease may be present in some
cases (e.g., muscle atrophy, weakness). A subset of individuals develop
visual hallucinations.

Prevalence

Major or mild frontotemporal NCD is a common cause of early-onset NCD in
individuals younger than 65 years. Population prevalence estimates are
in the range of 2--10 per 100,000. Approximately 20%--25% of cases of
frontotemporal NCD occur in individuals older than 65 years.
Frontotemporal NCD accounts for about 5% of all cases of dementia in
unselected autopsy series. Prevalence estimates of behavioral variant
and semantic language variant are higher among males, and prevalence
estimates of nonfluent language variant are higher among females.

Development and Course

Individuals with major or mild frontotemporal NCD commonly present in
the sixth decade of life, although the age at onset varies from the
third to the ninth decades. The disease is gradually progressive, with
median survival being 6--11 years after symptom onset and 3--4 years
after diagnosis. Survival is shorter and decline is faster in major or
mild frontotemporal NCD than in typical Alzheimer's disease.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Approximately 40% of individuals with major or mild frontotemporal NCD
have a family history of early-onset NCD, and approximately 10% show an
autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. A number of genetic factors have
been identified, such as mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule
associated protein tau (MAPT), the granulin gene (GRN), and the C9ORF72
gene. A number of families with causative mutations have been identified
(see the section "Diagnostic Markers" for this disorder), but many
individuals with known familial transmission do not have a known
mutation. The presence of motor neuron disease is associated with a more
rapid deterioration.

Diagnostic Markers

Computed tomography (CT) or structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
may show distinct patterns of atrophy. In behavioral-variant major or
mild frontotemporal NCD, both frontal lobes (especially the medial
frontal lobes) and the anterior temporal lobes are atrophic. In semantic
language--variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD, the middle,
inferior, and anterior temporal lobes are atrophic bilaterally but
asymmetrically, with the []{#index_split_067.html#p662}Major or Mild
Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder **617**

left side usually being more affected. Nonfluent language--variant major
or mild frontotemporal NCD is associated with predominantly left
posterior frontal-insular atrophy.

The logopenic variant of major or mild frontotemporal NCD is associated
with predominantly left posterior perisylvian or parietal atrophy.
Functional imaging demonstrates hy-poperfusion and/or cortical
hypometabolism in the corresponding brain regions, which may be present
in the early stages in the absence of structural abnormality. Emerging
biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid
amyloid-beta and tau levels, and amyloid imaging) may help in the
differential diagnosis, but the distinction from Alzheimer's disease can
remain difficult (the logopenic variant is in fact often a manifestation
of Alzheimer's disease).

In familial cases of frontotemporal NCD, the identification of genetic
mutations may help confirm the diagnosis. Mutations associated with
frontotemporal NCD include the genes encoding microtubule-associated
protein tau (MAPT) and granulin (GRN), C9ORF72, transactive response
DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43, or TARDBP), valosin-containing
protein (VCP), chromatin modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B), and fused in
sarcoma protein (FUS).

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild

Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder

Because of the relative early age at onset of the disorder, the disorder
oftens affects workplace and family life. Because of the involvement of
language and/or behavior, function is often more severely impaired
relatively early in the course. For individuals with the behavioral
variant, prior to diagnostic clarification there may be significant
family disruption, legal involvement, and problems in the workplace
because of socially inappropriate behaviors. The functional impairment
due to behavioral change and language dysfunction, which can include
hyperorality, impulsive wandering, and other dishinhibited behaviors,
may far exceed that due to the cognitive disturbance and may lead to
nursing home placement or institutionalization. These behaviors can be
severely disruptive, even in structured care settings, particularly when
the individuals are otherwise healthy, non-frail, and free of other
medical comorbidities.

Differential Diagnosis

Other neurocognitive disorders.

Other neurodegenerative diseases may be distinguished from major or mild
frontotemporal NCD by their characteristic features. In major or mild
NCD due to Alzheimer's disease, decline in learning and memory is an
early feature.

However, 10%--30% of patients presenting with a syndrome suggestive of
major or mild frontotemporal NCD are found at autopsy to have
Alzheimer's disease pathology. This occurs more frequently in
individuals who present with progressive dysexecutive syndromes in the
absence of behavioral changes or movement disorder or in those with the
logopenic variant.

In major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, core and suggestive features of
Lewy bodies must be present. In major or mild NCD due to Parkinson's
disease, spontaneous parkinsonism emerges well before the cognitive
decline. In major or mild vascular NCD, depending on affected brain
regions, there may also be loss of executive ability and behavioral
changes such as apathy, and this disorder should be considered in the
differential diagnosis. However, history of a cerebrovascular event is
temporally related to the onset of cognitive impairment in major or mild
vascular NCD, and neuroimaging reveals infarctions or white matter
lesions sufficient to account for the clinical picture.

Other neurological conditions.

Major or mild frontotemporal NCD overlaps with progressive supranuclear
palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and motor neuron disease clinically as
well as pathologically. Progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized
by

[]{#index_split_067.html#p663}**618**

Neurocognitive Disorders

supranuclear gaze palsies and axial-predominant parkinsonism.
Pseudobulbar signs may be present, and retropulsion is often prominent.
Neurocognitive assessment shows psychomotor slowing, poor working
memory, and executive dysfunction. Corticobasal degeneration presents
with asymmetric rigidity, limb apraxia, postural instability, myoclonus,
alien limb phenomenon, and cortical sensory loss. Many individuals with
behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD show features of
motor neuron disease, which tend to be mixed upper and predominantly
lower motor neuron disease.

Other mental disorders and medical conditions.

Behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD may be mistaken for
a primary mental disorder, such as major depression, bipolar disorders,
or schizophrenia, and individuals with this variant often present
initially to psychiatry. Over time, the development of progressive
neurocognitive difficulties will help to make the distinction. A careful
medical evaluation will help to exclude treatable causes of NCDs, such
as metabolic disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and infections.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p664}Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder With
Lewy Bodies **619**

For mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, code **331.83
(G31.84).** (**Note:** Do *not* use the additional code for Lewy body
disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be
indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features

Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies (NCDLB), in the
case of major neurocognitive disorder (NCD), corresponds to the
condition known as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The disorder
includes not only progressive cognitive impairment (with early changes
in complex attention and executive function rather than learning and
memory) but also recurrent complex visual hallucinations; and concurrent
symptoms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (which can
be a very early manifestation); as well as hallucinations in other
sensory modalities, depression, and delusions.

The symptoms fluctuate in a pattern that can resemble a delirium, but no
adequate underlying cause can be found. The variable presentation of
NCDLB symptoms reduces the likelihood of all symptoms being observed in
a brief clinic visit and necessitates a thorough assessment of caregiver
observations. The use of assessment scales specifically designed to
assess fluctuation may aid in diagnosis. Another core feature is
spontaneous parkinsonism, which must begin after the onset of cognitive
decline; by convention, major cognitive deficits are observed at least 1
year before the motor symptoms. The parkinsonism must also be
distinguished from neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal signs. Accurate
diagnosis is essential to safe treatment planning, as up to 50% of
individuals with NCDLB have severe sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs, and
these medications should be used with extreme caution in managing the
psychotic manifestations.

The diagnosis of mild NCDLB is appropriate for individuals who present
with the core or suggestive features at a stage when cognitive or
functional impairments are not of sufficient severity to fulfill
criteria for major NCD. However, as for all mild NCDs, there will often
be insufficient evidence to justify any single etiology, and use of the
unspecified diagnosis is most appropriate.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with NCDLB frequently experience repeated falls and syncope
and transient episodes of unexplained loss of consciousness. Autonomic
dysfunction, such as orthostatic hypotension and urinary incontinence,
may be observed. Auditory and other nonvisual hallucinations are common,
as are systematized delusions, delusional misiden-tification, and
depression.

Prevalence

The few population-based prevalence estimates for NCDLB available range
from 0.1% to 5% of the general elderly population, and from 1.7% to
30.5% of all dementia cases. In brain bank (autopsy) series, the
pathological lesions known as Lewy bodies are present in 20%--35% of
cases of dementia. The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1.5:1.

Development and Course

NCDLB is a gradually progressive disorder with insidious onset. However,
there is often a prodromal history of confusional episodes (delirium) of
acute onset, often precipitated by illness or surgery. The distinction
between NCDLB, in which Lewy bodies are primarily cortical in location,
and major or mild NCD due to Parkinson's disease, in which the pathology
is primarily in the basal ganglia, is the order in which the cognitive
and motor symptoms emerge. In NCDLB, the cognitive decline is manifested
early in the course of illness, at least a year before the onset of
motor symptoms (see the section "Differential Di-

[]{#index_split_067.html#p665}**620**

Neurocognitive Disorders

agnosis" for this disorder). Disease course may be characterized by
occasional plateaus but eventually progresses through severe dementia to
death. Average duration of survival is 5--7 years in clinical series.
Onset of symptoms is typically observed from the sixth through the ninth
decades of life, with most cases having their onset when affected
individuals are in their mid-70s.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Familial aggregation may occur, and several risk genes have been
identified, but in most cases of NCDLB, there is no family history.

Diagnostic Markers

The underlying neurodegenerative disease is primarily a synucleinopathy
due to alpha-synuclein misfolding and aggregation. Cognitive testing
beyond the use of a brief screening instrument may be necessary to
define deficits clearly. Assessment scales developed to measure
fluctuation can be useful. The associated condition REM sleep behavior
disorder may be diagnosed through a formal sleep study or identified by
questioning the patient or informant about relevant symptoms.
Neuroleptic sensitivity (challenge) is not recommended as a diagnostic
marker but raises suspicion of NCDLB if it occurs. A diagnosti-cally
suggestive feature is low striatal dopamine transporter uptake on single
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission
tomography (PET) scan.

Other clinically useful markers potentially include relative
preservation of medial temporal structures on computed tomography
(CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan; reduced striatal
dopamine transporter uptake on SPECT/PET scan; generalized low uptake on
SPECT/PET perfusion scan with reduced occipital activity; abnormal (low
uptake) MIBG myocardial scintigraphy suggesting sympathetic denervation;
and prominent slow-wave activity on the electroencephalogram with
temporal lobe transient waves.

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild

Neurocognitive Disorder With Lewy Bodies

Individuals with NCDLB are more functionally impaired than would be
expected for their cognitive deficits when contrasted to individuals
with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. This
is largely a result of motor and autonomic impairments, which cause
problems with toileting, transferring, and eating. Sleep disorders and
prominent psychiatric symptoms may also add to functional difficulties.
Consequently, the quality of life of individuals with NCDLB is often
significantly worse than that of individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

Differential Diagnosis

Major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease.

A key differentiating feature in clinical diagnosis is the temporal
sequence in which the parkinsonism and the NCD appear. For NCD due to
Parkinson's disease, the individual must develop cognitive decline in
the context of established Parkinson's disease; by convention, the
decline should not reach the stage of major NCD until at least 1 year
after Parkinson's is diagnosed.

If less than a year has passed since the onset of motor symptoms, the
diagnosis is NCDLB.

This distinction is clearer at the major NCD level than at the mild NCD
level.

The timing and sequence of parkinsonism and mild NCD may be more
difficult to determine because the onset and clinical presentation can
be ambiguous, and unspecified mild NCD should be diagnosed if the other
core and suggestive features are absent.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p666}Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive
Disorder **621**

Comorbidity

Lewy body pathology frequently coexists with Alzheimer's disease and
cerebrovascular disease pathology, particularly among the oldest age
groups. In Alzheimer's disease, there is concomitant synuclein pathology
in 60% of cases (if amygdala-restricted cases are included). In general,
there is a higher rate of Lewy body pathology in individuals with
dementia than in older individuals without dementia.

Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. The clinical features are consistent with a vascular etiology, as
suggested by either of the following:

1\. Onset of the cognitive deficits is temporally related to one or more
cerebrovascular events.

2\. Evidence for decline is prominent in complex attention (including
processing speed) and frontal-executive function.

C. There is evidence of the presence of cerebrovascular disease from
history, physical examination, and/or neuroimaging considered sufficient
to account for the neurocognitive deficits.

D. The symptoms are not better explained by another brain disease or
systemic disorder.

**Probable vascular neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if one of the
following is present; otherwise **possible vascular neurocognitive
disorder** should be diagnosed: 1. Clinical criteria are supported by
neuroimaging evidence of significant parenchymal injury attributed to
cerebrovascular disease (neuroimaging-supported).

2\. The neurocognitive syndrome is temporally related to one or more
documented cerebrovascular events.

3\. Both clinical and genetic (e.g., cerebral autosomal dominant
arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) evidence
of cerebrovascular disease is present.

**Possible vascular neurocognitive disorder** is diagnosed if the
clinical criteria are met but neuroimaging is not available and the
temporal relationship of the neurocognitive syndrome with one or more
cerebrovascular events is not established.

**Coding note:** For probable major vascular neurocognitive disorder,
with behavioral disturbance, code **290.40 (F01.51).** For probable
major vascular neurocognitive disorder, without behavioral disturbance,
code **290.40 (F01.50).** For possible major vascular neurocognitive
disorder, with or without behavioral disturbance, code **331.9
(G31.9).** An additional medical code for the cerebrovascular disease is
not needed.

For mild vascular neurocognitive disorder, code **331.83 (G31.84).**
(**Note:** Do *not* use an additional code for the vascular disease.
Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in
writing.)

Diagnostic Features

The diagnosis of major or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder (NCD)
requires the establishment of an NCD (Criterion A) and the determination
that cerebrovascular disease is the dominant if not exclusive pathology
that accounts for the cognitive deficits (Criteria B

and C). Vascular etiology may range from large vessel stroke to
microvascular disease; the

[]{#index_split_067.html#p667}**622**

Neurocognitive Disorders

presentation is therefore very heterogeneous, stemming from the types of
vascular lesions and their extent and location. The lesions may be
focal, multifocal, or diffuse and occur in various combinations.

Many individuals with major or mild vascular NCD present with multiple
infarctions, with an acute stepwise or fluctuating decline in cognition,
and intervening periods of stability and even some improvement. Others
may have gradual onset with slow progression, a rapid development of
deficits followed by relative stability, or another complex
presentation. Major or mild vascular NCD with a gradual onset and slow
progression is generally due to small vessel disease leading to lesions
in the white matter, basal ganglia, and/or thalamus. The gradual
progression in these cases is often punctuated by acute events that
leave subtle neurological deficits. The cognitive deficits in these
cases can be attributed to disruption of cortical-subcortical circuits,
and complex attention, particularly speed of information processing, and
executive ability are likely to be affected.

Assessing for the presence of sufficient cerebrovascular disease relies
on history, physical examination, and neuroimaging (Criterion C).
Etiological certainty requires the demonstration of abnormalities on
neuroimaging. The lack of neuroimaging can result in significant
diagnostic inaccuracy by overlooking "silent" brain infarction and white
matter lesions. However, if the neurocognitive impairment is temporally
associated with one or more well-documented strokes, a probable
diagnosis can be made in the absence of neuroimaging. Clinical evidence
of cerebrovascular disease includes documented history of stroke, with
cognitive decline temporally associated with the event, or physical
signs consistent with stroke (e.g., hemiparesis; pseudobulbar syndrome,
visual field defect). Neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\]
or computed tomography \[CT\]) evidence of cerebrovascular disease
comprises one or more of the following: one or more large vessel
infarcts or hemorrhages, a strategically placed single infarct or
hemorrhage (e.g., in angu-lar gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain), two or
more lacunar infarcts outside the brain stem, or extensive and confluent
white matter lesions. The latter is often termed *small vessel disease*
or *subcortical ischemic changes* on clinical neuroimaging evaluations.

For mild vascular NCD, history of a single stroke or extensive white
matter disease is generally sufficient. For major vascular NCD, two or
more strokes, a strategically placed stroke, or a combination of white
matter disease and one or more lacunes is generally necessary.

The disorder must not be better explained by another disorder. For
example, prominent memory deficit early in the course might suggest
Alzheimer\'s disease, early and prominent parkinsonian features would
suggest Parkinson\'s disease, and a close association between onset and
depression would suggest depression.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A neurological assessment often reveals history of stroke and/or
transient ischemic episodes, and signs indicative of brain infarctions.
Also commonly associated are personality and mood changes, abulia,
depression, and emotional lability. The development of late-onset
depressive symptoms accompanied by psychomotor slowing and executive
dysfunction is a common presentation among older adults with progressive
small vessel ischemic disease ("vascular depression").

Prevalence

Major or mild vascular NCD is the second most common cause of NCD after
Alzheimer's disease. In the United States, population prevalence
estimates for vascular dementia range from 0.2% in the 65--70 years age
group to 16% in individuals 80 years and older. Within 3 months
following stroke, 20%--30% of individuals are diagnosed with dementia.
In neuropathology series, the prevalence of vascular dementia increases
from 13% at age 70 years to 44.6% at age 90 years or older, in
comparison with Alzheimer's disease (23.6%--51%) and combined vascular
dementia and Alzheimer's disease (2%--46.4%). Higher prevalence has
[]{#index_split_067.html#p668}Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive
Disorder **623**

been reported in African Americans compared with Caucasians, and in East
Asian countries (e.g., Japan, China). Prevalence is higher in males than
in females.

Development and Course

Major or mild vascular NCD can occur at any age, although the prevalence
increases ex-ponentially after age 65 years. In older individuals,
additional pathologies may partly account for the neurocognitive
deficits. The course may vary from acute onset with partial improvement
to stepwise decline to progressive decline, with fluctuations and
plateaus of varying durations. Pure subcortical major or mild vascular
NCD can have a slowly progressive course that simulates major or mild
NCD due to Alzheimer's disease.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

The neurocognitive outcomes of vascular brain injury are influenced by
neuroplasticity factors such as education, physical exercise, and mental
activity.

Genetic and physiological.

The major risk factors for major or mild vascular NCD are the same as
those for cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension, diabetes,
smoking, obesity, high cholesterol levels, high homocysteine levels,
other risk factors for atherosclerosis and ar-teriolosclerosis, atrial
fibrillation, and other conditions increasing the risk of cerebral
emboli.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is an important risk factor in which amyloid
deposits occur within arterial vessels. Another key risk factor is the
hereditary condition cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with
subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, or CADASIL.

Diagnostic Markers

Structural neuroimaging, using MRI or CT, has an important role in the
diagnostic process. There are no other established biomarkers of major
or mild vascular NCD.

Functional Consequences of

Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder

Major or mild vascular NCD is commonly associated with physical deficits
that cause additional disability.

Differential Diagnosis

Other neurocognitive disorders.

Since incidental brain infarctions and white matter lesions are common
in older individuals, it is important to consider other possible
etiologies when an NCD is present. A history of memory deficit early in
the course, and progressive worsening of memory, language, executive
function, and perceptual-motor abilities in the absence of corresponding
focal lesions on brain imaging, are suggestive of Alzheimer's disease as
the primary diagnosis. Potential biomarkers currently being validated
for Alzheimer's disease, such as cerebrospinal fluid levels of
beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau, and amyloid imaging, may prove to
be helpful in the differential diagnosis. NCD with Lewy bodies is
distinguished from major or mild vascular NCD by its core features of
fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and spontaneous
parkinsonism. While deficits in executive function and language occur in
major or mild vascular NCD, the insidious onset and gradual progression
of behavioral features or language impairment are characteristic of
frontotemporal NCD and are not typical of vascular etiology.

Other medical conditions.

A diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is not made if other diseases
(e.g., brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, toxic or metabolic
disorders) are present and are of sufficient severity to account for the
cognitive impairment.

[]{#index_split_067.html#p669}**624**

Neurocognitive Disorders

Other mental disorders.

A diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is inappropriate if the
symptoms can be entirely attributed to delirium, although delirium may
sometimes be superimposed on a preexisting major or mild vascular NCD,
in which case both diagnoses can be made. If the criteria for major
depressive disorder are met and the cognitive impairment is temporally
related to the likely onset of the depression, major or mild vascular
NCD should not be diagnosed. However, if the NCD preceded the
development of the depression, or the severity of the cognitive
impairment is out of proportion to the severity of the depression, both
should be diagnosed.

Comorbidity

Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease commonly co-occurs with
major or mild vascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses should be made.
Major or mild vascular NCD

and depression frequently co-occur.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Traumatic Brain Injury

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. There is evidence of a traumatic brain injury---that is, an impact to
the head or other mechanisms of rapid movement or displacement of the
brain within the skull, with one or more of the following:

1\. Loss of consciousness.

2\. Posttraumatic amnesia.

3\. Disorientation and confusion.

4\. Neurological signs (e.g., neuroimaging demonstrating injury; a new
onset of seizures; a marked worsening of a preexisting seizure disorder;
visual field cuts; anosmia; hemiparesis).

C. The neurocognitive disorder presents immediately after the occurrence
of the traumatic brain injury or immediately after recovery of
consciousness and persists past the acute post-injury period.

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic
brain injury, with behavioral disturbance: For ICD-9-CM, first code
**907.0** late effect of intracranial injury without skull fracture,

[]{#index_split_067.html#p670}Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due
to Traumatic Brain Injury **625**

Specifiers

Rate the severity of the neurocognitive disorder (NCD), not the
underlying traumatic brain injury (see the section "Development and
Course" for this disorder).

Diagnostic Features

Major or mild NCD due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by an
impact to the head, or other mechanisms of rapid movement or
displacement of the brain within the skull, as can happen with blast
injuries. *Traumatic brain injury* is defined as brain trauma with
specific characteristics that include at least one of the following:
loss of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, disorientation and
confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological signs (e.g., positive
neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked worsening of a
preexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia, hemiparesis)
(Criterion B). To be attributable to TBI, the NCD must present either
immediately after the brain injury occurs or immediately after the
individual recovers consciousness after the injury and persist past the
acute post-injury period (Criterion C).

The cognitive presentation is variable. Difficulties in the domains of
complex attention, executive ability, learning, and memory are common as
well as slowing in speed of information processing and disturbances in
social cognition. In more severe TBI in which there is brain contusion,
intracranial hemorrhage, or penetrating injury, there may be additional
neurocognitive deficits, such as aphasia, neglect, and constructional
dyspraxia.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Major or mild NCD due to TBI may be accompanied by disturbances in
emotional function (e.g., irritability, easy frustration, tension and
anxiety, affective lability); personality changes (e.g., disinhibition,
apathy, suspiciousness, aggression); physical disturbances (e.g.,
headache, fatigue, sleep disorders, vertigo or dizziness, tinnitus or
hyperacusis, photosensitivity, anosmia, reduced tolerance to
psychotropic medications); and, particularly in more severe TBI,
neurological symptoms and signs (e.g., seizures, hemiparesis, visual
disturbances, cranial nerve deficits) and evidence of orthopedic
injuries.

Prevalence

In the United States, 1.7 million TBIs occur annually, resulting in 1.4
million emergency department visits, 275,000 hospitalizations, and
52,000 deaths. About 2% of the population lives with TBI-associated
disability. Males account for 59% of TBIs in the United States.

The most common etiologies of TBI in the United States are falls,
vehicular accidents, and being struck on the head. Collisions and blows
to the head that occur in the course of contact sports are increasingly
recognized as sources of mild TBI, with a concern that repeated mild TBI
may have cumulatively persisting sequelae.

Development and Course

The severity of a TBI is rated at the time of injury/initial assessment
as mild, moderate, or severe according to the thresholds in Table 2.

The severity rating of the TBI itself does not necessarily correspond to
the severity of the resulting NCD. The course of recovery from TBI is
variable, depending not only on the specifics of the injury but also on
cofactors, such as age, prior history of brain damage, or substance
abuse, that may favor or impede recovery.

Neurobehavioral symptoms tend to be most severe in the immediate
aftermath of the TBI. Except in the case of severe TBI, the typical
course is that of complete or substantial improvement in associated
neurocognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and signs.
Neurocognitive symptoms associated with mild TBI tend to resolve within
days to weeks after the injury with complete resolution typical by 3
months. Other symptoms that may potentially co-occur with the
neurological symptoms (e.g., depression, irritability, fatigue,
headache, photosensitivity, sleep disturbance) also tend to resolve in
the weeks following mild TBI. Substantial subsequent deterioration in
these areas should trigger consideration of additional diagnoses.
However, repeated mild TBI may be associated with persisting
neurocognitive disturbance.

With moderate and severe TBI, in addition to persistence of
neurocognitive deficits, there may be associated neurophysiological,
emotional, and behavioral complications.

These include seizures (particularly in the first year),
photosensitivity, hyperacusis, irritability, aggression, depression,
sleep disturbance, fatigue, apathy, inability to resume occupational and
social functioning at pre-injury level, and deterioration in
interpersonal relationships. Moderate and severe TBI have been
associated with increased risk of depression, aggression, and possibly
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

The features of persisting major or mild NCD due to TBI will vary by
age, specifics of the injury, and cofactors. Persisting TBI-related
impairment in an infant or child may be reflected in delays in reaching
developmental milestones (e.g., language acquisition), worse academic
performance, and possibly impaired social development. Among older
teenagers and adults, persisting symptoms may include various
neurocognitive deficits, irritability, hypersensitivity to light and
sound, easy fatigability, and mood changes, including depression,
anxiety, hostility, or apathy. In older individuals with depleted
cognitive reserve, mild TBI is more likely to result in incomplete
recoveries.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Risk factors for traumatic brain injury.

Traumatic brain injury rates vary by age, with

the highest prevalence among individuals younger than 4 years, older
adolescents, and individuals older than 65 years. Falls are the most
common cause of TBI, with motor vehicle accidents being second. Sports
concussions are frequent causes of TBI in older children, teenagers, and
young adults.

Risk factors for neurocognitive disorder after traumatic brain injury.

Repeated concussions can lead to persistent NCD and neuropathological
evidence of traumatic encephalopathy. Co-occurring intoxication with a
substance may increase the severity of a TBI from a motor vehicle
accident, but whether intoxication at the time of injury worsens
neurocognitive outcome is unknown.

Course modifiers.

Mild TBI generally resolves within a few weeks to months, although
resolution may be delayed or incomplete in the context of repeated TBI.
Worse outcome from

[]{#index_split_067.html#p672}Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild
Neurocognitive Disorder **627**

moderate to severe TBI is associated with older age (older than 40
years) and initial clinical pa-rameters, such as low Glasgow Coma Scale
score; worse motor function; pupillary nonreac-tivity; and computed
tomography (CT) evidence of brain injury (e.g., petechial hemorrhages,
subarachnoid hemorrhage, midline shift, obliteration of third
ventricle).

Diagnostic Markers

Beyond neuropsychological testing, CT scanning may reveal petechial
hemorrhages, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or evidence of contusion. Magnetic
resonance image scanning may also reveal hyperintensities suggestive of
microhemorrhages.

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild

Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury With mild NCD due
to TBI, individuals may report reduced cognitive efficiency, difficulty
concentrating, and lessened ability to perform usual activities. With
major NCD due to TBI, an individual may have difficulty in independent
living and self-care. Prominent neuromotor features, such as severe
incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing, may be present in major NCD
due to TBI and may add to functional difficulties. Individuals with TBI
histories report more depressive symptoms, and these can amplify
cognitive complaints and worsen functional outcome. Additionally, loss
of emotional control, including aggressive or inappropriate affect and
apathy, may be present after more severe TBI with greater neurocognitive
impairment. These features may compound difficulties with independent
living and self-care.

Differential Diagnosis

In some instances, severity of neurocognitive symptoms may appear to be
inconsistent with the severity of the TBI. After previously undetected
neurological complications (e.g., chronic hematoma) are excluded, the
possibility of diagnoses such as somatic symptom disorder or factitious
disorder need to be considered. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can
co-occur with the NCD and have overlapping symptoms (e.g., difficulty
concentrating, depressed mood, aggressive behavioral disinhibition).

Comorbidity

Among individuals with substance use disorders, the neurocognitive
effects of the substance contribute to or compound the TBI-associated
neurocognitive change. Some symptoms associated with TBI may overlap
with symptoms found in cases of PTSD, and the two disorders may
co-occur, especially in military populations.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. The neurocognitive impairments do not occur exclusively during the
course of a delirium and persist beyond the usual duration of
intoxication and acute withdrawal.

C. The involved substance or medication and duration and extent of use
are capable of producing the neurocognitive impairment.

D. The temporal course of the neurocognitive deficits is consistent with
the timing of substance or medication use and abstinence (e.g., the
deficits remain stable or improve after a period of abstinence).

[]{#index_split_067.html#p673}**628**

Neurocognitive Disorders

E. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical
condition or is not better explained by another mental disorder.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-induced neurocognitive disorders are indicated in
the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not
there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of
substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is
"1," and the clinician should record "mild \[substance\] use disorder"
before the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder (e.g., "mild
inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major neurocognitive
disorder"). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position
character is "2," and the clinician should record "moderate
\[substance\] use disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder,"
depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid substance use disorder, then the 4th position
character is "9," and the clinician should record only the
substance-induced neurocognitive disorder. For some classes of
substances (i.e., alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics), it is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild substance use disorder with a
substance-induced neurocognitive disorder; only a comorbid moderate or
severe substance use disorder, or no substance use disorder, can be
diagnosed. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be
indicated in writing.

Recording Procedures

ICD-9-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder
begins with the specific substance/medication (e.g., alcohol) that is
presumed to be causing the neurocognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code
is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based
on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the
classes, the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases in
which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific
class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance" should
be used.

The name of the disorder (i.e., \[specific substance\]-induced major
neurocognitive disorder or \[specific substance\]-induced mild
neurocognitive disorder) is followed by the type in the case of alcohol
(i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type),
followed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). Unlike the
recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the
substance/medication-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a
single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the
substance use disorder. For example, in the case of persistent
amnestic-confabulatory symptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use
disorder, the diagnosis is 291.1 alcohol-induced major neurocognitive
disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. An additional
diagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. If the
substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a
comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of
inhalants), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g.,
292.82 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder).

ICD-10-CM.

The name of the substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder
begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to
be causing the neurocognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected
from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For
substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for "other
substance" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged
to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is
unknown, the category "unknown substance"

should be used.

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the disorder (i.e., \[specific substance\]-induced major
neurocognitive disorder or \[specific substance\]-induced mild
neurocognitive disorder), followed by the type in the case of alcohol
(i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type),
followed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). For example,
in the case of persistent amnestic-confabulatory symptoms in a man with
a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.26 severe alcohol
use disorder with alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder,
amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. A separate diagnosis of the
comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If the
substance-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid
substance use disorder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants),
no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F18.988
inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder).

Diagnostic Features

Substance/medication-induced major or mild NCD is characterized by
neurocognitive impairments that persist beyond the usual duration of
intoxication and acute withdrawal (Criterion B). Initially, these
manifestations can reflect slow recovery of brain functions from a
period of prolonged substance use, and improvements in neurocognitive as
well as

[]{#index_split_072.html#p675}**630**

Neurocognitive Disorders

brain imaging indicators may be seen over many months. If the disorder
continues for an extended period, *persistent* should be specified. The
given substance and its use must be known to be capable of causing the
observed impairments (Criterion C). While nonspecific decrements in a
range of cognitive abilities can occur with nearly any substance of
abuse and a variety of medications, some patterns occur more frequently
with selected drug classes. For example, NCD due to sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines, barbiturates) may show
greater disturbances in memory than in other cognitive functions. NCD
induced by alcohol frequently manifests with a combination of
impairments in executive-function and memory and learning domains. The
temporal course of the substance-induced NCD must be consistent with
that of use of the given substance (Criterion D). In alcohol-induced
amnestic confabulatory (Korsakoff's) NCD, the features include prominent
amnesia (severe difficulty learning new information with rapid
forgetting) and a tendency to confabulate. These manifestations may
co-occur with signs of thiamine encephalopathy (Wernicke's
encephalopathy) with associated features such as nystagmus and ataxia.
Ophthalmoplegia of Wernicke's encephalopathy is typically characterized
by a lateral gaze paralysis.

In addition to or independent of the more common neurocognitive symptoms
related to methamphetamine use (e.g., difficulties with learning and
memory; executive function), methamphetamine use can also be associated
with evidence of vascular injury (e.g., focal weakness, unilateral
incoordination, asymmetrical reflexes). The most common neurocognitive
profile approximates that seen in vascular NCD.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Intermediate-duration NCD induced by drugs with central nervous system
depressant effects may manifest with added symptoms of increased
irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and dysphoria.
Intermediate-duration NCD induced by stimulant drugs may manifest with
rebound depression, hypersomnia, and apathy. In severe forms of
substance/medication-induced major NCD (e.g., associated with long-term
alcohol use), there may be prominent neuromotor features, such as
incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing. There may also be loss of
emotional control, including aggressive or inappropriate affect, or
apathy.

Prevalence

The prevalence of these conditions is not known. Prevalence figures for
substance abuse are available, and substance/medication-induced major or
mild NCDs are more likely in those who are older, have longer use, and
have other risk factors such as nutritional deficits.

For alcohol abuse, the rate of mild NCD of intermediate duration is
approximately 30%--

40% in the first 2 months of abstinence. Mild NCD may persist,
particularly in those who do not achieve stable abstinence until after
age 50 years. Major NCD is rare and may result from concomitant
nutritional deficits, as in alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory NCD.

For individuals quitting cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids,
phencyclidine, and sedative, hypnotics, or anxiolytics,
substance/medication-induced mild NCD of intermediate duration may occur
in one-third or more, and there is some evidence that these substances
may also be associated with persistent mild NCD. Major NCD associated
with these substances is rare, if it occurs at all. In the case of
methamphetamine, cerebrovascular disease can also occur, resulting in
diffuse or focal brain injury that can be of mild or major
neurocognitive levels. Solvent exposure has been linked to both major
and mild NCD of both intermediate and persistent duration.

The presence of NCD induced by cannabis and various hallucinogens is
controversial.

With cannabis, intoxication is accompanied by various neurocognitive
disturbances, but these tend to clear with abstinence.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p676}Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild
Neurocognitive Disorder **631**

Development and Course

Substance use disorders tend to commence during adolescence and peak in
the 20s and 30s. Although longer history of severe substance use
disorder is associated with greater likelihood of NCD, the relationships
are not straightforward, with substantial and even complete recovery of
neurocognitive functions being common among individuals who achieve
stable abstinence prior to age 50 years. Substance/medication-induced
major or mild NCD is most likely to become persistent in individuals who
continue abuse of substances past age 50 years, presumably because of a
combination of lessened neural plasticity and beginnings of other
age-related brain changes. Earlier commencement of abuse, particularly
of alcohol, may lead to defects in later neural development (e.g., later
stages of maturation of frontal circuitries), which may have effects on
social cognition as well as other neurocognitive abilities. For
alcohol-induced NCD, there may be an additive effect of aging and
alcohol-induced brain injury.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Risk factors for substance/medication-induced NCDs include older age,
longer use, and persistent use past age 50 years. In addition, for
alcohol-induced NCD, long-term nutritional deficiencies, liver disease,
vascular risk factors, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease
may contribute to risk.

Diagnostic Markers

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of individuals with chronic alcohol
abuse frequently reveals cortical thinning, white matter loss, and
enlargement of sulci and ventricles. While neuroimaging abnormalities
are more common in those with NCDs, it is possible to observe NCDs
without neuroimaging abnormalities, and vice versa. Specialized
techniques (e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) may reveal damage to
specific white matter tracts. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy may reveal
reduction in *N*-acetylaspartate, and increase in markers of
inflammation (e.g., myoinositol) or white matter injury (e.g., choline).
Many of these brain imaging changes and neurocognitive manifestations
reverse following successful abstinence. In individuals with
methamphetamine use disorder, MRI may also reveal hyperintensities
suggestive of microhemorrhages or larger areas of infarction.

Functional Consequences of Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild
Neurocognitive Disorder

The functional consequences of substance/medication-induced mild NCD are
sometimes augmented by reduced cognitive efficiency and difficulty
concentrating beyond that seen in many other NCDs. In addition, at both
major and mild levels, substance/medication-induced NCDs may have
associated motor syndromes that increase the level of functional
impairment.

Differential Diagnosis

Individuals with substance use disorders, substance intoxication, and
substance withdrawal are at increased risk for other conditions that may
independently, or through a compounding effect, result in neurocognitive
disturbance. These include history of traumatic brain injury and
infections that can accompany substance use disorder (e.g., HIV,
hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Therefore, presence of
substance/medication-induced major or mild NCD should be differentiated
from NCDs arising outside the context of substance use, intoxication,
and withdrawal, including these accompanying conditions (e.g., traumatic
brain injury).

[]{#index_split_072.html#p677}**632**

Neurocognitive Disorders

Comorbidity

Substance use disorders, substance intoxication, and substance
withdrawal are highly comorbid with other mental disorders. Comorbid
posttraumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorders, depressive and
bipolar disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders can contribute to
neurocognitive impairment in substance users. Traumatic brain injury
occurs more frequently with substance use, complicating efforts to
determine the etiology of NCD

in such cases. Severe, long-term alcohol use disorder can be associated
with major organ system disease, including cerebrovascular disease and
cirrhosis. Amphetamine-induced NCD may be accompanied by major or mild
vascular NCD, also secondary to amphetamine use.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to HIV Infection

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. There is documented infection with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV).

C. The neurocognitive disorder is not better explained by non-HIV
conditions, including secondary brain diseases such as progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis.

D. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical
condition and is not better explained by a mental disorder.

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection,
with behavioral disturbance, code first **042 (B20)** HIV infection,
followed by **294.11 (F02.81)** major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV
infection, with behavioral disturbance. For major neurocognitive
disorder due to HIV infection, without behavioral disturbance, code
first **042 (B20)** HIV infection, followed by **294.10 (F02.80)** major
neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, without behavioral
disturbance.

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, code **331.83
(G31.84).** (**Note:** Do *not* use the additional code for HIV
infection. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be
indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features

HIV disease is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus
type-1 (HIV-1), which is acquired through exposure to bodily fluids of
an infected person through injection drug use, unprotected sexual
contact, or accidental or iatrogenic exposure (e.g., contaminated blood
supply, needle puncture injury to medical personnel). HIV infects
several types of cells, most particularly immune cells. Over time, the
infection can cause severe depletion of "T-helper" (CD4) lymphocytes,
resulting in severe immunocompromise, often leading to opportunistic
infections and neoplasms. This advanced form of HIV infection is termed
*acquired immune deficiency syndrome* (AIDS). Diagnosis of HIV is
confirmed by established laboratory methods such as enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay for HIV antibody with Western blot confirmation
and/or polymerase chain reaction--based assays for HIV.

Some individuals with HIV infection develop an NCD, which generally
shows a "subcortical pattern" with prominently impaired executive
function, slowing of processing speed, problems with more demanding
attentional tasks, and difficulty in learning new information, but fewer
problems with recall of learned information. In major NCD, slowing may
be prominent. Language difficulties, such as aphasia, are uncommon,
although reductions in fluency may be observed. HIV pathogenic processes
can affect any part of the brain; therefore, other patterns are
possible.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p678}Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due
to HIV Infection **633**

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Major or mild NCD due to HIV infection is usually more prevalent in
individuals with prior episodes of severe immunosuppression, high viral
loads in the cerebrospinal fluid, and indicators of advanced HIV disease
such as anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Individuals with advanced NCD may
experience prominent neuromotor features such as severe incoordination,
ataxia, and motor slowing. There may be loss of emotional control,
including aggressive or inappropriate affect or apathy.

Prevalence

Depending on stage of HIV disease, approximately one-third to over
one-half of HIV-infected individuals have at least mild neurocognitive
disturbance, but some of these disturbances may not meet the full
criteria for mild NCD. An estimated 25% of individuals with HIV will
have signs and symptoms that meet criteria for mild NCD, and in fewer
than 5% would criteria for major NCD be met.

Development and Course

An NCD due to HIV infection can resolve, improve, slowly worsen, or have
a fluctuating course. Rapid progression to profound neurocognitive
impairment is uncommon in the context of currently available combination
antiviral treatment; consequently, an abrupt change in mental status in
an individual with HIV may prompt an evaluation of other medical sources
for the cognitive change, including secondary infections. Because HIV
infection preferentially affects subcortical regions over the course of
illness, including deep white matter, the progression of the disorder
follows a "subcortical" pattern. Since HIV

can affect a variety of brain regions, and the illness can take on many
different trajectories depending on associated comorbidities and
consequences of HIV, the overall course of an NCD due to HIV infection
has considerable heterogeneity. A subcortical neurocognitive profile may
interact with age over the life course, when psychomotor slowing and
motor impairments such as slowed gait may occur as a consequence of
other age-related conditions so that the overall progression may appear
more pronounced in later life.

In developed countries, HIV disease is primarily a condition of adults,
with acquisition via risky behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, injection
drug use) beginning in late adolescence and peaking during young and
middle adulthood. In developing countries, particularly sub-Saharan
Africa, where HIV testing and antiretroviral treatments for pregnant
women are not readily available, perinatal transmission is common. The
NCD in such infants and children may present primarily as
neurodevelopmental delay. As individuals treated for HIV survive into
older age, additive and interactive neurocognitive effects of HIV and
aging, including other NCDs (e.g., due to Alzheimer's disease, due to
Parkinson's disease), are possible.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Risk and prognostic factors for HIV infection.

Risk factors for HIV infection include injection drug use, unprotected
sex, and unprotected blood supply and other iatrogenic factors.

Risk and prognostic factors for major or mild neurocognitive disorder
due to HIV infection.

Paradoxically, NCD due to HIV infection has not declined significantly
with the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy, although the most
severe presentations (consistent with the diagnosis of major NCD) have
decreased sharply. Contributory factors may include inadequate control
of HIV in the central nervous system (CNS), the evolution of
drug-resistant viral strains, the effects of chronic long-term systemic
and brain inflammation, and the effects of comorbid factors such as
aging, drug abuse, past history of CNS

trauma, and co-infections, such as with the hepatitis C virus. Chronic
exposure to antiretroviral drugs also raises the possibility of
neurotoxicity, although this has not been definitively established.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p679}**634**

Neurocognitive Disorders

Diagnostic Markers

Serum HIV testing is required for the diagnosis. In addition, HIV
characterization of the cerebrospinal fluid may be helpful if it reveals
a disproportionately high viral load in cerebrospinal fluid versus in
the plasma. Neuroimaging (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\]) may
reveal reduction in total brain volume, cortical thinning, reduction in
white matter volume, and patchy areas of abnormal white matter
(hyperintensities). MRI or lumbar puncture may be helpful to exclude a
specific medical condition such as cryptococcus infection or herpes
encephalitis that may contribute to CNS changes in the context of AIDS.
Specialized techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging may reveal
damage to specific white matter tracts.

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild

Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection

Functional consequences of major or mild NCD due to HIV infection are
variable across individuals. Thus, impaired executive abilities and
slowed information processing may substantially interfere with the
complex disease management decisions required for adherence to the
combined antiretroviral therapy regimen. The likelihood of comorbid
disease may further create functional challenges.

Differential Diagnosis

In the presence of comorbidities, such as other infections (e.g.,
hepatitis C virus, syphilis), drug abuse (e.g., methamphetamine abuse),
or prior head injury or neurodevelopmental conditions, major or mild NCD
due to HIV infection can be diagnosed provided there is evidence that
infection with HIV has worsened any NCDs due to such preexisting or
comorbid conditions. Among older adults, onset of neurocognitive decline
related to cerebrovascular disease or neurodegeneration (e.g., major or
mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease) may need to be differentiated. In
general, stable, fluctuating (without progression) or improving
neurocognitive status would favor an HIV etiology, whereas steady or
stepwise deterioration would suggest neurodegenerative or vascular
etiology. Because more severe immunodeficiency can result in
opportunistic infections of the brain (e.g., toxoplasmosis;
cryptococcosis) and neoplasia (e.g., CNS lymphoma), sudden onset of an
NCD or sudden worsening of that disorder demands active investigation of
non-HIV etiologies.

Comorbidity

HIV disease is accompanied by chronic systemic and neuro-inflammation
that can be associated with cerebrovascular disease and metabolic
syndrome. These complications can be part of the pathogenesis of major
or mild NCD due to HIV infection. HIV frequently co-occurs with
conditions such as substance use disorders when the substance has been
injected and other sexually transmitted disorders.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Prion Disease

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. There is insidious onset, and rapid progression of impairment is
common.

C. There are motor features of prion disease, such as myoclonus or
ataxia, or biomarker evidence.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p680}Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due
to Prion Disease **635**

D. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical
condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder.

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease,
with behavioral disturbance, code first **046.79 (A81.9)** prion
disease, followed by **294.11 (F02.81)** major neurocognitive disorder
due to prion disease, with behavioral disturbance. For major
neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease, without behavioral
disturbance, code first **046.79 (A81.9)** prion disease, followed by
**294.10 (F02.80)** major neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease,
without behavioral disturbance.

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease, code **331.83
(G31.84).** (**Note:** Do *not* use the additional code for prion
disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be
indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features

The classification of major or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to
prion disease includes NCDs due to a group of subacute spongiform
encephalopathies (including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker
syndrome, and fatal insomnia) caused by transmissible agents known as
*prions.*

The most common type is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, typically
referred to as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Variant CJD is much
rarer and is associated with transmission of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, also called "mad cow disease." Typically, individuals
with CJD present with neurocognitive deficits, ataxia, and abnormal
movements such as myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia; a startle reflex is
also common. Typically, the history reveals rapid progression to major
NCD over as little as 6 months, and thus the disorder is typically seen
only at the major level. However, many individuals with the disorder may
have atypical presentations, and the disease can be confirmed only by
biopsy or at autopsy. Individuals with variant CJD may present with a
greater preponderance of psychiatric symptoms, characterized a by low
mood, withdrawal, and anxiety. Prion disease is typically not diagnosed
without at least one of the characteristic biomarker features:
recognized lesions on magnetic resonance imaging with DWI
(diffusion-weighted imaging) or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery), tau or 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid, characteristic
triphasic waves on electroencephalogram, or, for rare familial forms,
family history or genetic testing.

Prevalence

The annual incidence of sporadic CJD is approximately one or two cases
per million people. Prevalence is unknown but very low given the short
survival.

Development and Course

Prion disease may develop at any age in adults---the peak age for the
sporadic CJD is approximately 67 years---although it has been reported
to occur in individuals spanning the teenage years to late life.
Prodromal symptoms of prion disease may include fatigue, anxiety,
problems with appetite or sleeping, or difficulties with concentration.
After several weeks, these symptoms may be followed by incoordination,
altered vision, or abnormal gait or other movements that may be
myoclonic, choreoathetoid, or ballistic, along with a rapidly
progressive dementia. The disease typically progresses very rapidly to
the major level of impairment over several months. More rarely, it can
progress over 2 years and appear similar in its course to other NCDs.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p681}**636**

Neurocognitive Disorders

Risk Factors and Prognosis

Environmental.

Cross-species transmission of prion infections, with agents that are
closely related to the human form, has been demonstrated (e.g., the
outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy inducing variant CJD in the
United Kingdom during the mid-1990s). Transmission by corneal
transplantation and by human growth factor injection has been
documented, and anecdotal cases of transmission to health care workers
have been reported.

Genetic and physiological.

There is a genetic component in up to 15% of cases, associated with an
autosomal dominant mutation.

Diagnostic Markers

Prion disease can be definitively confirmed only by biopsy or at
autopsy. Although there are no distinctive findings on cerebrospinal
fluid analysis across the prion diseases, reliable biomarkers are being
developed and include 14-3-3 protein (particularly for sporadic CJD) as
well as tau protein. Magnetic resonance brain imaging is currently
considered the most sensitive diagnostic test when DWI is performed,
with the most common finding being multifocal gray matter
hyperintensities in subcortical and cortical regions. In some
individuals, the electroencephalogram reveals periodic sharp, often
triphasic and synchronous discharges at a rate of 0.5--2 Hz at some
point during the course of the disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Other major neurocognitive disorders.

Major NCD due to prion disease may appear

similar in its course to other NCDs, but prion diseases are typically
distinguished by their rapid progression and prominent cerebellar and
motor symptoms.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Parkinson's Disease

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. The disturbance occurs in the setting of established Parkinson's
disease.

C. There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment.

D. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical
condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder.

**Major or mild neurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson's

**331.83 (G31.84).**

(**Note:** Do *not* use the additional code for Parkinson's disease.
Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in
writing.) Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of major or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due
to Parkinson's disease is cognitive decline following the onset of
Parkinson's disease. The disturbance must occur in the setting of
established Parkinson's disease (Criterion B), and deficits must have
developed gradually (Criterion C). The NCD is viewed as *probably* due
to Parkinson's disease when there is no evidence of another disorder
that might be contributing to the cognitive decline *and* when the
Parkinson's disease clearly precedes onset of the NCD. The NCD is
considered *possibly* due to Parkinson's disease *either* when there is
no evidence of another disorder that might be contributing to the
cognitive decline *or* when the Parkinson's disease precedes onset of
the NCD, but not both.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Frequently present features include apathy, depressed mood, anxious
mood, hallucinations, delusions, personality changes, rapid eye movement
sleep behavior disorder, and excessive daytime sleepiness.

Prevalence

The prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the United States steadily
increases with age from approximately 0.5% between ages 65 and 69 to 3%
at age 85 years and older. Parkinson's disease is more common in males
than in females. Among individuals with Parkinson's disease, as many as
75% will develop a major NCD sometime in the course of their disease.

The prevalence of mild NCD in Parkinson's disease has been estimated at
27%.

Development and Course

Onset of Parkinson's disease is typically between the sixth and ninth
decades of life, with most expression in the early 60s. Mild NCD often
develops relatively early in the course of Parkinson's disease, whereas
major impairment typically does not occur until late.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Risk factors for Parkinson's disease include exposure to herbicides and
pesticides.

Genetic and physiological.

Potential risk factors for NCD among individuals with Parkinson's
disease include older age at disease onset and increasing duration of
disease.

Diagnostic Markers

Neuropsychological testing, with a focus on tests that do not rely on
motor function, is critical in detecting the core cognitive deficits,
particularly at the mild NCD phase. Structural neuroimaging and dopamine
transporter scans, such as DaT scans, may differentiate Lewy
body--related dementias (Parkinson's and dementia with Lewy bodies) from
non--

[]{#index_split_072.html#p683}**638**

Neurocognitive Disorders

Lewy body--related dementias (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and can
sometimes be helpful in the evaluation of major or mild NCD due to
Parkinson's disease.

Differential Diagnosis

Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies.

This distinction is based substantially on the timing and sequence of
motor and cognitive symptoms. For NCD to be attributed to Parkinson's
disease, the motor and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease must be
present well before (by convention, at least 1 year prior) cognitive
decline has reached the level of major NCD, whereas in major or mild NCD
with Lewy bodies, cognitive symptoms begin shortly before, or concurrent
with, motor symptoms. For mild NCD, the timing is harder to establish
because the diagnosis itself is less clear and the two disorders exist
on a continuum. Unless Parkinson's disease has been established for some
time prior to the onset of cognitive decline, or typical features of
major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies are present, it is preferable to
diagnose unspecified mild NCD.

Major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease.

The motor features

are the key to distinguishing major or mild NCD due to Parkinson's
disease from major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease. However, the
two disorders can co-occur.

Major or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder.

Major or mild vascular NCD may present with parkinsonian features such
as psychomotor slowing that may occur as a consequence of subcortical
small vessel disease. However, the parkinsonian features typically are
not sufficient for a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and the course of
the NCD usually has a clear association with cerebrovascular changes.

Neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (e.g.,
neurodegenerative disorders).

When a diagnosis of major or mild NCD due to Parkinson's disease is
being considered, the distinction must also be made from other brain
disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal
degeneration, multiple system atrophy, tumors, and hydrocephalus.

Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism.

Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism can occur in

individuals with other NCDs, particularly when dopamine-blocking drugs
are prescribed for the behavioral manifestations of such disorders

Other medical conditions.

Delirium and NCDs due to side effects of dopamine-blocking drugs and
other medical conditions (e.g., sedation or impaired cognition, severe
hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency) must also be ruled out.

Comorbidity

Parkinson's disease may coexist with Alzheimer's disease and
cerebrovascular disease, especially in older individuals. The
compounding of multiple pathological features may diminish the
functional abilities of individuals with Parkinson's disease. Motor
symptoms and frequent co-occurrence of depression or apathy can make
functional impairment worse.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Huntington's Disease

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. There is insidious onset and gradual progression.

C. There is clinically established Huntington's disease, or risk for
Huntington's disease based on family history or genetic testing.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p684}Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due
to Huntington's Disease **639**

D. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical
condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder.

disease, with behavioral disturbance, code first **333.4 (G10)**

**331.83 (G31.84).**

(**Note:** Do *not* use the additional code for Huntington's disease.
Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in
writing.) Diagnostic Features

Progressive cognitive impairment is a core feature of Huntington's
disease, with early changes in executive function (i.e., processing
speed, organization, and planning) rather than learning and memory.
Cognitive and associated behavioral changes often precede the emergence
of the typical motor abnormalities of bradykinesia (i.e., slowing of
voluntary movement) and chorea (i.e., involuntary jerking movements). A
diagnosis of definite Huntington's disease is given in the presence of
unequivocal, extrapyramidal motor abnormalities in an individual with
either a family history of Huntington's disease or genetic testing
showing a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene, located on
chromosome 4.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Depression, irritability, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and
apathy are frequently, and psychosis more rarely, associated with
Huntington's disease and often precede the onset of motor symptoms.

Prevalence

Neurocognitive deficits are an eventual outcome of Huntington's disease;
the worldwide prevalence is estimated to be 2.7 per 100,000. The
prevalence of Huntington's disease in North America, Europe, and
Australia is 5.7 per 100,000, with a much lower prevalence of 0.40 per
100,000 in Asia.

Development and Course

The average age at diagnosis of Huntington's disease is approximately 40
years, although this varies widely. Age at onset is inversely correlated
with CAG expansion length. Juve-nile Huntington's disease (onset before
age 20) may present more commonly with bradykinesia, dystonia, and
rigidity than with the choreic movements characteristic of the
adult-onset disorder. The disease is gradually progressive, with median
survival approximately 15 years after motor symptom diagnosis.

Phenotypic expression of Huntington's disease varies by presence of
motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Psychiatric and cognitive
abnormalities can predate the motor abnormality by at least 15 years.
Initial symptoms requiring care often include irritabity, anxiety, or
depressed mood. Other behavioral disturbances may include pronounced
apathy, disinhibition, impulsivity, and impaired insight, with apathy
often becoming more progressive over time. Early movement symptoms may
involve the appearance of fidgetiness of the extremities as well as mild
*apraxia* (i.e., difficulty with purposeful movements), particularly
with fine motor tasks. As the disorder progresses, other motor problems
include impaired gait ( *ataxia*) and postural instability. Motor
impairment eventually affects speech production ( *dysarthria*) such
that the speech becomes very difficult to understand,
[]{#index_split_072.html#p685}**640**

Neurocognitive Disorders

which may result in significant distress resulting from the
communication barrier in the context of comparatively intact cognition.
Advanced motor disease severely affects gait with progressive ataxia.
Eventually individuals become nonambulatory. End-stage motor disease
impairs motor control of eating and swallowing, typically a major
contributor to the death of the individual from aspiration pneumonia.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

The genetic basis of Huntington's disease is a fully penetrant autosomal
dominant expansion of the CAG trincleotide, often called a *CAG repeat*
in the huntingtin gene. A repeat length of 36 or more is invariably
associated with Huntington's disease, with longer repeat lengths
associated with early age at onset. A CAG repeat length of 36 or more is
invariably associated with Huntington's disease.

Diagnostic Markers

Genetic testing is the primary laboratory test for the determination of
Huntington's disease, which is an autosomal dominant disorder with
complete penetrance. The trinucleotide CAG is observed to have a repeat
expansion in the gene that encodes huntingtin protein on chromosome 4. A
diagnosis of Huntington's disease is not made in the presence of the
gene expansion alone, but the diagnosis is made only after symptoms
become manifest. Some individuals with a positive family history request
genetic testing in a presymp-tomatic stage. Associated features may also
include neuroimaging changes; volume loss in the basal ganglia,
particularly the caudate nucleus and putamen, is well known to occur and
progresses over the course of illness. Other structural and functional
changes have been observed in brain imaging but remain research
measures.

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild

Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease

In the prodromal phase of illness and at early diagnosis, occupational
decline is most common, with most individuals reporting some loss of
ability to engage in their typical work.

The emotional, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of Huntington's
disease, such as disinhibition and personality changes, are highly
associated with functional decline. Cognitive deficits that contribute
most to functional decline may include speed of processing, initiation,
and attention rather than memory impairment. Given that Huntington's
disease onset occurs in productive years of life, it may have a very
disruptive effect on performance in the work setting as well as social
and family life. As the disease progresses, disability from problems
such as impaired gait, dysarthria, and impulsive or irritable behaviors
may substantially add to the level of impairment and daily care needs,
over and above the care needs attributable to the cognitive decline.
Severe choreic movements may substantially interfere with provision of
care such as bathing, dressing, and toileting.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders.

Early symptoms of Huntington's disease may include instability of mood,
irritability, or compulsive behaviors that may suggest another mental
disorder. However, genetic testing or the development of motor symptoms
will distinguish the presence of Huntington's disease.

Other neurocognitive disorders.

The early symptoms of Huntington's disease, particularly symptoms of
executive dysfunction and impaired psychomotor speed, may resemble other
neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), such as major or mild vascular NCD.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p686}Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due
to Another Medical Condition **641**

Other movement disorders.

Huntington's disease must also be differentiated from other disorders or
conditions associated with chorea, such as Wilson's disease,
drug-induced tardive dyskinesia, Sydenham's chorea, systemic lupus
erythematosus, or senile chorea.

Rarely, individuals may present with a course similar to that of
Huntington's disease but without positive genetic testing; this is
considered to be a Huntington's disease pheno-copy that results from a
variety of potential genetic factors.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Another Medical Condition

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings that the neurocognitive disorder is the
pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.

C. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental
disorder or another specific neurocognitive disorder (e.g., Alzheimer's
disease, HIV infection).

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to another
medical condition, with behavioral disturbance, code first the other
medical condition, followed by the major neurocognitive disorder due to
another medical condition, with behavioral disturbance (e.g., 340
\[G35\] multiple sclerosis, **294.11 \[F02.81\]** major neurocognitive
disorder due to multiple sclerosis, with behavioral disturbance). For
major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, without
behavioral disturbance, code first the other medical condition, followed
by the major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition,
without behavioral disturbance (e.g., 340 \[G35\] multiple sclerosis,
**294.10 \[F02.80\]** major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple
sclerosis, without behavioral disturbance).

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, code
**331.83 (G31.84).**

(**Note:** Do *not* use the additional code for the other medical
condition. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be
indicated in writing.) Diagnostic Features

A number of other medical conditions can cause neurocognitive disorders
(NCDs). These conditions include structural lesions (e.g., primary or
secondary brain tumors, subdural hematoma, slowly progressive or
normal-pressure hydrocephalus), hypoxia related to hy-poperfusion from
heart failure, endocrine conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism,
hypercalcemia, hypoglycemia), nutritional conditions (e.g., deficiencies
of thiamine or niacin), other infectious conditions (e.g.,
neurosyphilis, cryptococcosis), immune disorders (e.g., temporal
arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), hepatic or renal failure,
metabolic conditions (e.g., Kufs' disease, adrenoleukodystrophy,
metachromatic leukodystrophy, other storage diseases of adulthood and
childhood), and other neurological conditions (e.g., epilepsy, multiple
sclerosis). Unusual causes of central nervous system injury, such as
electrical shock or intracranial radiation, are generally evident from
the history. The temporal association between the onset or exacerbation
of the medical condition and the development of the cognitive deficit
offers the greatest support that the NCD is induced by the medical
condition. Diagnostic certainty regarding this relationship may be
increased if the neurocognitive deficits ameliorate partially or
stabilize in the context of treatment of the medical condition.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p687}**642**

Neurocognitive Disorders

Development and Course

Typically the course of the NCD progresses in a manner that is
commensurate with progression of the underlying medical disorder. In
circumstances where the medical disorder is treatable (e.g.,
hypothyroidism), the neurocognitive deficit may improve or at least not
progress.

When the medical condition has a deteriorative course (e.g., secondary
progressive multiple sclerosis), the neurocognitive deficits will
progress along with the temporal course of illness.

Diagnostic Markers

Associated physical examination and laboratory findings and other
clinical features depend on the nature and severity of the medical
condition.

Differential Diagnosis

Other major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

The presence of an attributable medical

condition does not entirely exclude the possibility of another major or
mild NCD. If cognitive deficits persist following successful treatment
of an associated medical condition, then another etiology may be
responsible for the cognitive decline.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

Due to Multiple Etiologies

Diagnostic Criteria

 

A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings that the neurocognitive disorder is the
pathophysiological consequence of more than one etiological process,
excluding substances (e.g., neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's
disease with subsequent development of vascular neurocognitive
disorder).

**Note:** Please refer to the diagnostic criteria for the various
neurocognitive disorders due to specific medical conditions for guidance
on establishing the particular etiologies.

C. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental
disorder and do not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.

**Coding note:** For major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple
etiologies, with behavioral disturbance, code **294.11 (F02.81)**; for
major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, without
behavioral disturbance, code **294.10 (F02.80).** All of the etiological
medical conditions (with the exception of vascular disease) should be
coded and listed separately immediately before major neurocognitive
disorder due to multiple etiologies (e.g., **331.0**

**\[G30.9\]** Alzheimer's disease; **331.82 \[G31.83\]** Lewy body
disease; **294.11 \[F02.81\]** major neurocognitive disorder due to
multiple etiologies, with behavioral disturbance).

When a cerebrovascular etiology is contributing to the neurocognitive
disorder, the diagnosis of vascular neurocognitive disorder should be
listed in addition to major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple
etiologies. For example, for a presentation of major neurocognitive
disorder due to both Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease, with
behavioral disturbance, code the following: **331.0 (G30.9)**
Alzheimer's disease; **294.11 (F02.81)** major neurocognitive disorder
due to multiple etiologies, with behavioral disturbance; **290.40
(F01.51)** major vascular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral
disturbance.

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, code
**331.83 (G31.84).** (**Note:** Do *not* use the additional codes for
the etiologies. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still
be indicated in writing.)

[]{#index_split_072.html#p688}Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder

**643**

This category is included to cover the clinical presentation of a
neurocognitive disorder (NCD) for which there is evidence that multiple
medical conditions have played a probable role in the development of the
NCD. In addition to evidence indicative of the presence of multiple
medical conditions that are known to cause NCD (i.e., findings from the
history and physical examination, and laboratory findings), it may be
helpful to refer to the diagnostic criteria and text for the various
medical etiologies (e.g., NCD due to Parkinson's disease) for more
information on establishing the etiological connection for that
particular medical condition.

Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder

**799.59 (R41.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a neurocognitive disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified neurocognitive disorder category is used in situations in
which the precise etiology cannot be determined with sufficient
certainty to make an etiological attribution.

**Coding note:** For unspecified major or mild neurocognitive disorder,
code 799.59 (R41.9).

(**Note:** Do *not* use additional codes for any presumed etiological
medical conditions. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but may be
indicated in writing.)

[]{#index_split_072.html#p689} *This page intentionally left blank*

[]{#index_split_072.html#p690}**Personality**

**Disorders**

This chapter begins with a general definition of personality disorder
that applies to each of the 10 specific personality disorders. A
*personality disorder* is an enduring pattern of inner experience and
behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the
individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in
adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to
distress or impairment.

With any ongoing review process, especially one of this complexity,
different viewpoints emerge, and an effort was made to accommodate them.
Thus, personality disorders are included in both Sections II and III.
The material in Section II represents an update of text associated with
the same criteria found in DSM-IV-TR, whereas Section III includes the
proposed research model for personality disorder diagnosis and
conceptualization developed by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality
Disorders Work Group. As this field evolves, it is hoped that both
versions will serve clinical practice and research initiatives,
respectively.

The following personality disorders are included in this chapter.

• **Paranoid personality disorder** is a pattern of distrust and
suspiciousness such that others' motives are interpreted as malevolent.

• **Schizoid personality disorder** is a pattern of detachment from
social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression.

• **Schizotypal personality disorder** is a pattern of acute discomfort
in close relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions, and
eccentricities of behavior.

• **Antisocial personality disorder** is a pattern of disregard for, and
violation of, the rights of others.

• **Borderline personality disorder** is a pattern of instability in
interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked
impulsivity.

• **Histrionic personality disorder** is a pattern of excessive
emotionality and attention seeking.

• **Narcissistic personality disorder** is a pattern of grandiosity,
need for admiration, and lack of empathy.

• **Avoidant personality disorder** is a pattern of social inhibition,
feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation.

• **Dependent personality disorder** is a pattern of submissive and
clinging behavior related to an excessive need to be taken care of.

• **Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder** is a pattern of
preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control.

• **Personality change due to another medical condition** is a
persistent personality disturbance that is judged to be due to the
direct physiological effects of a medical condition (e.g., frontal lobe
lesion).

• **Other specified personality disorder and unspecified personality
disorder** is a category provided for two situations: 1) the
individual's personality pattern meets the general criteria for a
personality disorder, and traits of several different personality
disorders are present, but the criteria for any specific personality
disorder are not met; **645**

[]{#index_split_072.html#p691}**646**

Personality Disorders

or 2) the individual's personality pattern meets the general criteria
for a personality disorder, but the individual is considered to have a
personality disorder that is not included in the DSM-5 classification
(e.g., passive-aggressive personality disorder).

The personality disorders are grouped into three clusters based on
descriptive similarities.

Cluster A includes paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality
disorders. Individuals with these disorders often appear odd or
eccentric. Cluster B includes antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and
narcissistic personality disorders. Individuals with these disorders
often appear dramatic, emotional, or erratic. Cluster C includes
avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders.
Individuals with these disorders often appear anxious or fearful. It
should be noted that this clustering system, although useful in some
research and educational situations, has serious limitations and has not
been consistently validated.

Moreover, individuals frequently present with co-occurring personality
disorders from different clusters. Prevalence estimates for the
different clusters suggest 5.7% for disorders in Cluster A, 1.5% for
disorders in Cluster B, 6.0% for disorders in Cluster C, and 9.1% for
any personality disorder, indicating frequent co-occurrence of disorders
from different clusters. Data from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic
Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions suggest that approximately 15%
of U.S. adults have at least one personality disorder.

Dimensional Models for Personality Disorders

The diagnostic approach used in this manual represents the categorical
perspective that personality disorders are qualitatively distinct
clinical syndromes. An alternative to the categorical approach is the
dimensional perspective that personality disorders represent maladaptive
variants of personality traits that merge imperceptibly into normality
and into one another. See Section III for a full description of a
dimensional model for personality disorders. The DSM-IV personality
disorder clusters (i.e., odd-eccentric, dramatic-emotional, and
anxious-fearful) may also be viewed as dimensions representing spectra
of personality dysfunction on a continuum with other mental disorders.
The alternative dimensional models have much in common and together
appear to cover the important areas of personality dysfunction. Their
integration, clinical utility, and relationship with the personality
disorder diagnostic categories and various aspects of personality
dysfunction are under active investigation.

General Personality Disorder

Criteria

A. An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates
markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture. This pattern
is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas:

1\. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other
people, and events).

2\. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and
appropriateness of emotional response).

3\. Interpersonal functioning.

4\. Impulse control.

B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range
of personal and social situations.

C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p692}General Personality Disorder

**647**

D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be
traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood.

E. The enduring pattern is not better explained as a manifestation or
consequence of another mental disorder.

F. The enduring pattern is not attributable to the physiological effects
of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition (e.g., head trauma).

Diagnostic Features

*Personality traits* are enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to,
and thinking about the environment and oneself that are exhibited in a
wide range of social and personal contexts.

Only when personality traits are inflexible and maladaptive and cause
significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they
constitute personality disorders. The essential feature of a personality
disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that
deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture and
is manifested in at least two of the following areas: cognition,
affectivity, interpersonal functioning, or impulse control (Criterion
A). This enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad
range of personal and social situations (Criterion B) and leads to
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The pattern is
stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least
to adolescence or early adulthood (Criterion D). The pattern is not
better explained as a manifestation or consequence of another mental
disorder (Criterion E) and is not attributable to the physiological
effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure to
a toxin) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma) (Criterion F).
Specific diagnostic criteria are also provided for each of the
personality disorders included in this chapter.

The diagnosis of personality disorders requires an evaluation of the
individual's long-term patterns of functioning, and the particular
personality features must be evident by early adulthood. The personality
traits that define these disorders must also be distinguished from
characteristics that emerge in response to specific situational
stressors or more transient mental states (e.g., bipolar, depressive, or
anxiety disorders; substance intoxication). The clinician should assess
the stability of personality traits over time and across different
situations. Although a single interview with the individual is sometimes
sufficient for making the diagnosis, it is often necessary to conduct
more than one interview and to space these over time. Assessment can
also be complicated by the fact that the characteristics that define a
personality disorder may not be considered problematic by the individual
(i.e., the traits are often ego-syntonic). To help overcome this
difficulty, supplementary information from other informants may be
helpful.

Development and Course

The features of a personality disorder usually become recognizable
during adolescence or early adult life. By definition, a personality
disorder is an enduring pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaving that
is relatively stable over time. Some types of personality disorder
(notably, antisocial and borderline personality disorders) tend to
become less evident or to remit with age, whereas this appears to be
less true for some other types (e.g., obsessive-compulsive and
schizotypal personality disorders).

Personality disorder categories may be applied with children or
adolescents in those relatively unusual instances in which the
individual's particular maladaptive personality traits appear to be
pervasive, persistent, and unlikely to be limited to a particular
developmental stage or another mental disorder. It should be recognized
that the traits of a personality disorder that appear in childhood will
often not persist unchanged into adult life.

For a personality disorder to be diagnosed in an individual younger than
18 years, the features must have been present for at least 1 year. The
one exception to this is antisocial per-

[]{#index_split_072.html#p693}**648**

Personality Disorders

sonality disorder, which cannot be diagnosed in individuals younger than
18 years. Although, by definition, a personality disorder requires an
onset no later than early adulthood, individuals may not come to
clinical attention until relatively late in life. A personality disorder
may be exacerbated following the loss of significant supporting persons
(e.g., a spouse) or previously stabilizing social situations (e.g., a
job). However, the development of a change in personality in middle
adulthood or later life warrants a thorough evaluation to determine the
possible presence of a personality change due to another medical
condition or an unrecognized substance use disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Judgments about personality functioning must take into account the
individual's ethnic, cultural, and social background. Personality
disorders should not be confused with problems associated with
acculturation following immigration or with the expression of habits,
customs, or religious and political values professed by the individual's
culture of origin. It is useful for the clinician, especially when
evaluating someone from a different background, to obtain additional
information from informants who are familiar with the person's cultural
background.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Certain personality disorders (e.g., antisocial personality disorder)
are diagnosed more frequently in males. Others (e.g., borderline,
histrionic, and dependent personality disorders) are diagnosed more
frequently in females. Although these differences in prevalence probably
reflect real gender differences in the presence of such patterns,
clinicians must be cautious not to overdiagnose or underdiagnose certain
personality disorders in females or in males because of social
stereotypes about typical gender roles and behaviors.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders and personality traits.

Many of the specific criteria for the personality disorders describe
features (e.g., suspiciousness, dependency, insensitivity) that are also
characteristic of episodes of other mental disorders. A personality
disorder should be diagnosed only when the defining characteristics
appeared before early adulthood, are typical of the individual's
long-term functioning, and do not occur exclusively during an episode of
another mental disorder. It may be particularly difficult (and not
particularly useful) to distinguish personality disorders from
persistent mental disorders such as persistent depressive disorder that
have an early onset and an enduring, relatively stable course. Some
personality disorders may have a "spectrum" relationship to other mental
disorders (e.g., schizotypal personality disorder with schizophrenia;
avoidant personality disorder with social anxiety disorder \[social
phobia\]) based on phenomenological or biological similarities or
familial aggregation.

Personality disorders must be distinguished from personality traits that
do not reach the threshold for a personality disorder. Personality
traits are diagnosed as a personality disorder only when they are
inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional
impairment or subjective distress.

Psychotic disorders.

For the three personality disorders that may be related to the psychotic
disorders (i.e., paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal), there is an
exclusion criterion stating that the pattern of behavior must not have
occurred exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar or
depressive disorder with psychotic features, or another psychotic
disorder. When an individual has a persistent mental disorder (e.g.,
schizophrenia) that was preceded by a preexisting personality disorder,
the personality disorder should also be recorded, followed by
"premorbid" in parentheses.

Anxiety and depressive disorders.

The clinician must be cautious in diagnosing personality disorders
during an episode of a depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder, be-

**649**

cause these conditions may have cross-sectional symptom features that
mimic personality traits and may make it more difficult to evaluate
retrospectively the individual's long-term patterns of functioning.

Posttraumatic stress disorder.

When personality changes emerge and persist after an

individual has been exposed to extreme stress, a diagnosis of
posttraumatic stress disorder should be considered.

Substance use disorders.

When an individual has a substance use disorder, it is important not to
make a personality disorder diagnosis based solely on behaviors that are
consequences of substance intoxication or withdrawal or that are
associated with activities in the service of sustaining substance use
(e.g., antisocial behavior).

Personality change due to another medical condition.

When enduring changes in personality arise as a result of the
physiological effects of another medical condition (e.g., brain tumor),
a diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition
should be considered.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of paranoid personality disorder is a pattern of
pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their motives
are interpreted as malevolent. This pattern begins by early adulthood
and is present in a variety of contexts.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p695}**650**

Personality Disorders

Individuals with this disorder assume that other people will exploit,
harm, or deceive them, even if no evidence exists to support this
expectation (Criterion A1). They suspect on the basis of little or no
evidence that others are plotting against them and may attack them
suddenly, at any time and without reason. They often feel that they have
been deeply and irreversibly injured by another person or persons even
when there is no objective evidence for this. They are preoccupied with
unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of their friends
and associates, whose actions are minutely scrutinized for evidence of
hostile intentions (Criterion A2). Any perceived deviation from
trustworthiness or loyalty serves to support their underlying
assumptions. They are so amazed when a friend or associate shows loyalty
that they cannot trust or believe it. If they get into trouble, they
expect that friends and associates will either attack or ignore them.

Individuals with paranoid personality disorder are reluctant to confide
in or become close to others because they fear that the information they
share will be used against them (Criterion A3). They may refuse to
answer personal questions, saying that the information is "nobody's
business." They read hidden meanings that are demeaning and threatening
into benign remarks or events (Criterion A4). For example, an individual
with this disorder may misinterpret an honest mistake by a store clerk
as a deliberate attempt to short-change, or view a casual humorous
remark by a coworker as a serious character attack.

Compliments are often misinterpreted (e.g., a compliment on a new
acquisition is misinterpreted as a criticism for selfishness; a
compliment on an accomplishment is misinterpreted as an attempt to
coerce more and better performance). They may view an offer of help as a
criticism that they are not doing well enough on their own.

Individuals with this disorder persistently bear grudges and are
unwilling to forgive the insults, injuries, or slights that they think
they have received (Criterion A5). Minor slights arouse major hostility,
and the hostile feelings persist for a long time. Because they are
constantly vigilant to the harmful intentions of others, they very often
feel that their character or reputation has been attacked or that they
have been slighted in some other way. They are quick to counterattack
and react with anger to perceived insults (Criterion A6). Individuals
with this disorder may be pathologically jealous, often suspecting that
their spouse or sexual partner is unfaithful without any adequate
justification (Criterion A7). They may gather trivial and circumstantial
"evidence" to support their jealous beliefs.

They want to maintain complete control of intimate relationships to
avoid being betrayed and may constantly question and challenge the
whereabouts, actions, intentions, and fidelity of their spouse or
partner.

Paranoid personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the pattern of
behavior occurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a
bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, or
another psychotic disorder, or if it is attributable to the
physiological effects of a neurological (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy)
or another medical condition (Criterion B).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with paranoid personality disorder are generally difficult
to get along with and often have problems with close relationships.
Their excessive suspiciousness and hostility may be expressed in overt
argumentativeness, in recurrent complaining, or by quiet, apparently
hostile aloofness. Because they are hypervigilant for potential threats,
they may act in a guarded, secretive, or devious manner and appear to be
"cold" and lacking in tender feelings. Although they may appear to be
objective, rational, and unemotional, they more often display a labile
range of affect, with hostile, stubborn, and sarcastic expressions
predominating. Their combative and suspicious nature may elicit a
hostile response in others, which then serves to confirm their original
expectations.

Because individuals with paranoid personality disorder lack trust in
others, they have an excessive need to be self-sufficient and a strong
sense of autonomy. They also need to

[]{#index_split_072.html#p696}Paranoid Personality Disorder

**651**

have a high degree of control over those around them. They are often
rigid, critical of others, and unable to collaborate, although they have
great difficulty accepting criticism themselves. They may blame others
for their own shortcomings. Because of their quickness to counterattack
in response to the threats they perceive around them, they may be
litigious and frequently become involved in legal disputes. Individuals
with this disorder seek to confirm their preconceived negative notions
regarding people or situations they encounter, attributing malevolent
motivations to others that are projections of their own fears. They may
exhibit thinly hidden, unrealistic grandiose fantasies, are often
attuned to issues of power and rank, and tend to develop negative
stereotypes of others, particularly those from population groups
distinct from their own. Attracted by simplistic formulations of the
world, they are often wary of ambiguous situations. They may be
perceived as "fanatics"

and form tightly knit "cults" or groups with others who share their
paranoid belief systems.

Particularly in response to stress, individuals with this disorder may
experience very brief psychotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours). In
some instances, paranoid personality disorder may appear as the
premorbid antecedent of delusional disorder or schizophrenia.
Individuals with paranoid personality disorder may develop major
depressive disorder and may be at increased risk for agoraphobia and
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Alcohol and other substance use disorders
frequently occur. The most common co-occurring personality disorders
appear to be schizotypal, schizoid, narcissistic, avoidant, and
borderline.

Prevalence

A prevalence estimate for paranoid personality based on a probability
subsample from Part II of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication
suggests a prevalence of 2.3%, while the National Epidemiologic Survey
on Alcohol and Related Conditions data suggest a prevalence of paranoid
personality disorder of 4.4%.

Development and Course

Paranoid personality disorder may be first apparent in childhood and
adolescence with solitariness, poor peer relationships, social anxiety,
underachievement in school, hypersensitivity, peculiar thoughts and
language, and idiosyncratic fantasies. These children may appear to be
"odd" or "eccentric" and attract teasing. In clinical samples, this
disorder appears to be more commonly diagnosed in males.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

There is some evidence for an increased prevalence of paranoid
personality disorder in relatives of probands with schizophrenia and for
a more specific familial relationship with delusional disorder,
persecutory type.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Some behaviors that are influenced by sociocultural contexts or specific
life circumstances may be erroneously labeled paranoid and may even be
reinforced by the process of clinical evaluation. Members of minority
groups, immigrants, political and economic refugees, or individuals of
different ethnic backgrounds may display guarded or defensive behaviors
because of unfamiliarity (e.g., language barriers or lack of knowledge
of rules and regulations) or in response to the perceived neglect or
indifference of the majority society. These behaviors can, in turn,
generate anger and frustration in those who deal with these individuals,
thus setting up a vicious cycle of mutual mistrust, which should not be
confused with paranoid personality disorder. Some ethnic groups also
display culturally related behaviors that can be misinterpreted as
paranoid.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p697}**652**

Personality Disorders

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.

Paranoid personality disorder can

be distinguished from delusional disorder, persecutory type;
schizophrenia; and a bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic
features because these disorders are all characterized by a period of
persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations). For
an additional diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder to be given,
the personality disorder must have been present before the onset of
psychotic symptoms and must persist when the psychotic symptoms are in
remission. When an individual has another persistent mental disorder
(e.g., schizophrenia) that was preceded by paranoid personality
disorder, paranoid personality disorder should also be recorded,
followed by "premorbid" in parentheses.

Personality change due to another medical condition.

Paranoid personality disorder

must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical
condition, in which the traits that emerge are attributable to the
direct effects of another medical condition on the central nervous
system.

Substance use disorders.

Paranoid personality disorder must be distinguished from symptoms that
may develop in association with persistent substance use.

Paranoid traits associated with physical handicaps.

The disorder must also be distinguished from paranoid traits associated
with the development of physical handicaps (e.g., a hearing impairment).

Other personality disorders and personality traits.

Other personality disorders may be

confused with paranoid personality disorder because they have certain
features in common.

It is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on
differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual
has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality
disorders in addition to paranoid personality disorder, all can be
diagnosed. Paranoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality
disorder share the traits of suspiciousness, interpersonal aloofness,
and paranoid ideation, but schizotypal personality disorder also
includes symptoms such as magical thinking, unusual perceptual
experiences, and odd thinking and speech. Individuals with behaviors
that meet criteria for schizoid personality disorder are often perceived
as strange, eccentric, cold, and aloof, but they do not usually have
prominent paranoid ideation. The tendency of individuals with paranoid
personality disorder to react to minor stimuli with anger is also seen
in borderline and histrionic personality disorders. However, these
disorders are not necessarily associated with pervasive suspiciousness.
People with avoidant personality disorder may also be reluctant to
confide in others, but more from fear of being embarrassed or found
inadequate than from fear of others' malicious intent. Although
antisocial behavior may be present in some individuals with paranoid
personality disorder, it is not usually motivated by a desire for
personal gain or to exploit others as in antisocial personality
disorder, but rather is more often attributable to a desire for revenge.
Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may occasionally
display suspiciousness, social withdrawal, or alienation, but this
derives primarily from fears of having their imperfections or flaws
revealed.

Paranoid traits may be adaptive, particularly in threatening
environments. Paranoid personality disorder should be diagnosed only
when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause
significant functional impairment or subjective distress.

Schizoid Personality Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**301.20 (F60.1)**

A. A pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a
restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings,
beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as
indicated by four (or more) of the following:

[]{#index_split_072.html#p698}Schizoid Personality Disorder

**653**

1\. Neither desires nor enjoys close relationships, including being part
of a family.

2\. Almost always chooses solitary activities.

3\. Has little, if any, interest in having sexual experiences with
another person.

4\. Takes pleasure in few, if any, activities.

5\. Lacks close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives.

6\. Appears indifferent to the praise or criticism of others.

7\. Shows emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affectivity.

B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a
bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another
psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder and is not attributable
to the physiological effects of another medical condition.

**Note:**

If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add
"premorbid," i.e., "schizoid personality disorder (premorbid)."

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of schizoid personality disorder is a pervasive
pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range
of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings. This pattern begins
by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.

Individuals with schizoid personality disorder appear to lack a desire
for intimacy, seem indifferent to opportunities to develop close
relationships, and do not seem to derive much satisfaction from being
part of a family or other social group (Criterion A1). They prefer
spending time by themselves, rather than being with other people. They
often appear to be socially isolated or "loners" and almost always
choose solitary activities or hobbies that do not include interaction
with others (Criterion A2). They prefer mechanical or abstract tasks,
such as computer or mathematical games. They may have very little
interest in having sexual experiences with another person (Criterion A3)
and take pleasure in few, if any, activities (Criterion A4). There is
usually a reduced experience of pleasure from sensory, bodily, or
interpersonal experiences, such as walking on a beach at sunset or
having sex. These individuals have no close friends or confidants,
except possibly a first-degree relative (Criterion A5).

Individuals with schizoid personality disorder often seem indifferent to
the approval or criticism of others and do not appear to be bothered by
what others may think of them (Criterion A6). They may be oblivious to
the normal subtleties of social interaction and often do not respond
appropriately to social cues so that they seem socially inept or
superficial and self-absorbed. They usually display a "bland" exterior
without visible emotional reactivity and rarely reciprocate gestures or
facial expressions, such as smiles or nods (Criterion A7). They claim
that they rarely experience strong emotions such as anger and joy.

They often display a constricted affect and appear cold and aloof.
However, in those very unusual circumstances in which these individuals
become at least temporarily comfortable in revealing themselves, they
may acknowledge having painful feelings, particularly related to social
interactions.

Schizoid personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the pattern of
behavior occurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a
bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another
psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder, or if it is
attributable to the physiological effects of a neurological (e.g.,
temporal lobe epilepsy) or another medical condition (Criterion B).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with schizoid personality disorder may have particular
difficulty expressing anger, even in response to direct provocation,
which contributes to the impression that

[]{#index_split_072.html#p699}**654**

Personality Disorders

they lack emotion. Their lives sometimes seem directionless, and they
may appear to

"drift" in their goals. Such individuals often react passively to
adverse circumstances and have difficulty responding appropriately to
important life events. Because of their lack of social skills and lack
of desire for sexual experiences, individuals with this disorder have
few friendships, date infrequently, and often do not marry. Occupational
functioning may be impaired, particularly if interpersonal involvement
is required, but individuals with this disorder may do well when they
work under conditions of social isolation. Particularly in response to
stress, individuals with this disorder may experience very brief
psychotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours). In some instances,
schizoid personality disorder may appear as the premorbid antecedent of
delusional disorder or schizophrenia. Individuals with this disorder may
sometimes develop major depressive disorder.

Schizoid personality disorder most often co-occurs with schizotypal,
paranoid, and avoidant personality disorders.

Prevalence

Schizoid personality disorder is uncommon in clinical settings. A
prevalence estimate for schizoid personality based on a probability
subsample from Part II of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication
suggests a prevalence of 4.9%. Data from the 2001--2002

National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions suggest
a prevalence of 3.1%.

Development and Course

Schizoid personality disorder may be first apparent in childhood and
adolescence with solitariness, poor peer relationships, and
underachievement in school, which mark these children or adolescents as
different and make them subject to teasing.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Schizoid personality disorder may have increased prevalence in the
relatives of individuals with schizophrenia or schizotypal personality
disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Individuals from a variety of cultural backgrounds sometimes exhibit
defensive behaviors and interpersonal styles that may be erroneously
labeled as "schizoid." For example, those who have moved from rural to
metropolitan environments may react with "emotional freezing" that may
last for several months and manifest as solitary activities, constricted
affect, and other deficits in communication. Immigrants from other
countries are sometimes mistakenly perceived as cold, hostile, or
indifferent.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Schizoid personality disorder is diagnosed slightly more often in males
and may cause more impairment in them.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.

Schizoid personality disorder can

be distinguished from delusional disorder, schizophrenia, and a bipolar
or depressive disorder with psychotic features because these disorders
are all characterized by a period of persistent psychotic symptoms
(e.g., delusions and hallucinations). To give an additional diagnosis of
schizoid personality disorder, the personality disorder must have been
present before the onset of psychotic symptoms and must persist when the
psychotic symptoms []{#index_split_072.html#p700}Schizotypal Personality
Disorder

**655**

are in remission. When an individual has a persistent psychotic disorder
(e.g., schizophrenia) that was preceded by schizoid personality
disorder, schizoid personality disorder should also be recorded,
followed by "premorbid" in parentheses.

Autism spectrum disorder.

There may be great difficulty differentiating individuals with schizoid
personality disorder from those with milder forms of autism spectrum
disorder, which may be differentiated by more severely impaired social
interaction and stereotyped behaviors and interests.

Personality change due to another medical condition.

Schizoid personality disorder

must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical
condition, in which the traits that emerge are attributable to the
effects of another medical condition on the central nervous system.

Substance use disorders.

Schizoid personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms
that may develop in association with persistent substance use.

Other personality disorders and personality traits.

Other personality disorders may be

confused with schizoid personality disorder because they have certain
features in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among
these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features.
However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria
for one or more personality disorders in addition to schizoid
personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although characteristics of
social isolation and restricted affectivity are common to schizoid,
schizotypal, and paranoid personality disorders, schizoid personality
disorder can be distinguished from schizotypal personality disorder by
the lack of cognitive and perceptual distortions and from paranoid
personality disorder by the lack of suspiciousness and paranoid
ideation. The social isolation of schizoid personality disorder can be
distinguished from that of avoidant personality disorder, which is
attributable to fear of being embarrassed or found inadequate and
excessive anticipation of rejection. In contrast, people with schizoid
personality disorder have a more pervasive detachment and limited desire
for social intimacy. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder may also show an apparent social detachment stemming from
devotion to work and discomfort with emotions, but they do have an
underlying capacity for intimacy.

Individuals who are "loners" may display personality traits that might
be considered schizoid. Only when these traits are inflexible and
maladaptive and cause significant functional impairment or subjective
distress do they constitute schizoid personality disorder.

Schizotypal Personality Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**301.22 (F21)**

A. A pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by
acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as
well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of
behavior, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of
contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: 1. Ideas of
reference (excluding delusions of reference).

2\. Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is
inconsistent with subcultural norms (e.g., superstitiousness, belief in
clairvoyance, telepathy, or

"sixth sense"; in children and adolescents, bizarre fantasies or
preoccupations).

3\. Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions.

4\. Odd thinking and speech (e.g., vague, circumstantial, metaphorical,
overelaborate, or stereotyped).

5\. Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p701}**656**

Personality Disorders

6\. Inappropriate or constricted affect.

7\. Behavior or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or peculiar.

8\. Lack of close friends or confidants other than first-degree
relatives.

9\. Excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with familiarity and
tends to be associated with paranoid fears rather than negative
judgments about self.

B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a
bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another
psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.

**Note:** If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add
"premorbid," e.g., "schizotypal personality disorder (premorbid)."

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of schizotypal personality disorder is a pervasive
pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort
with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by
cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior. This
pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of
contexts.

Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder often have ideas of
reference (i.e., incorrect interpretations of casual incidents and
external events as having a particular and unusual meaning specifically
for the person) (Criterion A1). These should be distinguished from
delusions of reference, in which the beliefs are held with delusional
conviction. These individuals may be superstitious or preoccupied with
paranormal phenomena that are outside the norms of their subculture
(Criterion A2). They may feel that they have special powers to sense
events before they happen or to read others' thoughts. They may believe
that they have magical control over others, which can be implemented
directly (e.g., believing that their spouse's taking the dog out for a
walk is the direct result of thinking an hour earlier it should be done)
or indirectly through compliance with magical rituals (e.g., walking
past a specific object three times to avoid a certain harmful outcome).

Perceptual alterations may be present (e.g., sensing that another person
is present or hearing a voice murmuring his or her name) (Criterion A3).
Their speech may include unusual or idiosyncratic phrasing and
construction. It is often loose, digressive, or vague, but without
actual derailment or incoherence (Criterion A4). Responses can be either
overly concrete or overly abstract, and words or concepts are sometimes
applied in unusual ways (e.g., the individual may state that he or she
was not "talkable" at work).

Individuals with this disorder are often suspicious and may have
paranoid ideation (e.g., believing their colleagues at work are intent
on undermining their reputation with the boss) (Criterion A5). They are
usually not able to negotiate the full range of affects and
interpersonal cuing required for successful relationships and thus often
appear to interact with others in an inappropriate, stiff, or
constricted fashion (Criterion A6). These individuals are often
considered to be odd or eccentric because of unusual mannerisms, an
often unkempt manner of dress that does not quite "fit together," and
inattention to the usual social conventions (e.g., the individual may
avoid eye contact, wear clothes that are ink stained and ill-fitting,
and be unable to join in the give-and-take banter of coworkers)
(Criterion A7).

Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder experience
interpersonal relatedness as problematic and are uncomfortable relating
to other people. Although they may express unhappiness about their lack
of relationships, their behavior suggests a decreased desire for
intimate contacts. As a result, they usually have no or few close
friends or confidants other than a first-degree relative (Criterion A8).
They are anxious in social situations, particularly those involving
unfamiliar people (Criterion A9). They will interact with other
individuals when they have to but prefer to keep to themselves because
they feel that they are different and just do not "fit in." Their social
anxiety does not easily abate, []{#index_split_072.html#p702}Schizotypal
Personality Disorder

**657**

even when they spend more time in the setting or become more familiar
with the other people, because their anxiety tends to be associated with
suspiciousness regarding others'

motivations. For example, when attending a dinner party, the individual
with schizotypal personality disorder will not become more relaxed as
time goes on, but rather may become increasingly tense and suspicious.

Schizotypal personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the pattern
of behavior occurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a
bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another
psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder (Criterion B).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder often seek treatment
for the associated symptoms of anxiety or depression rather than for the
personality disorder features per se.

Particularly in response to stress, individuals with this disorder may
experience transient psychotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours),
although they usually are insufficient in duration to warrant an
additional diagnosis such as brief psychotic disorder or
schizophreniform disorder. In some cases, clinically significant
psychotic symptoms may develop that meet criteria for brief psychotic
disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or
schizophrenia. Over half may have a history of at least one major
depressive episode.

From 30% to 50% of individuals diagnosed with this disorder have a
concurrent diagnosis of major depressive disorder when admitted to a
clinical setting. There is considerable co-occurrence with schizoid,
paranoid, avoidant, and borderline personality disorders.

Prevalence

In community studies of schizotypal personality disorder, reported rates
range from 0.6%

in Norwegian samples to 4.6% in a U.S. community sample. The prevalence
of schizotypal personality disorder in clinical populations seems to be
infrequent (0%--1.9%), with a higher estimated prevalence in the general
population (3.9%) found in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol
and Related Conditions.

Development and Course

Schizotypal personality disorder has a relatively stable course, with
only a small proportion of individuals going on to develop schizophrenia
or another psychotic disorder.

Schizotypal personality disorder may be first apparent in childhood and
adolescence with solitariness, poor peer relationships, social anxiety,
underachievement in school, hypersensitivity, peculiar thoughts and
language, and bizarre fantasies. These children may appear "odd" or
"eccentric" and attract teasing.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Schizotypal personality disorder appears to aggregate familially and is
more prevalent among the first-degree biological relatives of
individuals with schizophrenia than among the general population. There
may also be a modest increase in schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders in the relatives of probands with schizotypal personality
disorder.

Cultural-Related Diagnostic Issues

Cognitive and perceptual distortions must be evaluated in the context of
the individual's cultural milieu. Pervasive culturally determined
characteristics, particularly those regarding religious beliefs and
rituals, can appear to be schizotypal to the uninformed outsider (e.g.,
voodoo, speaking in tongues, life beyond death, shamanism, mind reading,
sixth sense, evil eye, magical beliefs related to health and illness).

[]{#index_split_072.html#p703}**658**

Personality Disorders

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Schizotypal personality disorder may be slightly more common in males.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.

Schizotypal personality disorder

can be distinguished from delusional disorder, schizophrenia, and a
bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features because these
disorders are all characterized by a period of persistent psychotic
symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations). To give an additional
diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder, the personality disorder
must have been present before the onset of psychotic symptoms and
persist when the psychotic symptoms are in remission. When an individual
has a persistent psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia) that was
preceded by schizotypal personality disorder, schizotypal personality
disorder should also be recorded, followed by "premorbid" in
parentheses.

Neurodevelopmental disorders.

There may be great difficulty differentiating children with schizotypal
personality disorder from the heterogeneous group of solitary, odd
children whose behavior is characterized by marked social isolation,
eccentricity, or peculiar-ities of language and whose diagnoses would
probably include milder forms of autism spectrum disorder or language
communication disorders. Communication disorders may be differentiated
by the primacy and severity of the disorder in language and by the
characteristic features of impaired language found in a specialized
language assessment.

Milder forms of autism spectrum disorder are differentiated by the even
greater lack of social awareness and emotional reciprocity and
stereotyped behaviors and interests.

Personality change due to another medical condition.

Schizotypal personality disorder must be distinguished from personality
change due to another medical condition, in which the traits that emerge
are attributable to the effects of another medical condition on the
central nervous system.

Substance use disorders.

Schizotypal personality disorder must also be distinguished from
symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.

Other personality disorders and personality traits.

Other personality disorders may

be confused with schizotypal personality disorder because they have
certain features in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish
among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic
features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet
criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to
schizotypal personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although
paranoid and schizoid personality disorders may also be characterized by
social detachment and restricted affect, schizotypal personality
disorder can be distinguished from these two diagnoses by the presence
of cognitive or perceptual distortions and marked eccentricity or
oddness. Close relationships are limited in both schizotypal personality
disorder and avoidant personality disorder; however, in avoidant
personality disorder an active desire for relationships is constrained
by a fear of rejection, whereas in schizotypal personality disorder
there is a lack of desire for relationships and persistent detachment.
Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may also display
suspiciousness, social withdrawal, or alienation, but in narcissistic
personality disorder these qualities derive primarily from fears of
having imperfections or flaws revealed. Individuals with borderline
personality disorder may also have transient, psychotic-like symptoms,
but these are usually more closely related to affective shifts in
response to stress (e.g., intense anger, anxiety, disappointment) and
are usually more dissociative (e.g., derealization, depersonalization).
In contrast, individuals with schizotypal personality disorder are more
likely to have enduring psychotic-like symptoms that may worsen under
stress but are less likely to be invariably associated with pronounced
affective symptoms. Although social isolation may occur in borderline
personality []{#index_split_072.html#p704}Antisocial Personality
Disorder

disorder, it is usually secondary to repeated interpersonal failures due
to angry outbursts and frequent mood shifts, rather than a result of a
persistent lack of social contacts and desire for intimacy. Furthermore,
individuals with schizotypal personality disorder do not usually
demonstrate the impulsive or manipulative behaviors of the individual
with borderline personality disorder. However, there is a high rate of
co-occurrence between the two disorders, so that making such
distinctions is not always feasible. Schizotypal features during
adolescence may be reflective of transient emotional turmoil, rather
than an enduring personality disorder.

**Cluster B Personality Disorders**

Antisocial Personality Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**301.7 (F60.2)**

A. A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of
others, occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by three (or more) of
the following: 1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to
lawful behaviors, as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are
grounds for arrest.

2\. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or
conning others for personal profit or pleasure.

3\. Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead.

4\. Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical
fights or assaults.

5\. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others.

6\. Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to
sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations.

7\. Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or
rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.

B. The individual is at least age 18 years.

C. There is evidence of conduct disorder with onset before age 15 years.

D. The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the
course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is a pervasive
pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that
begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.
This pattern has also been referred to as *psychopathy,* *sociopathy,*
or *dyssocial personality disorder.* Because deceit and manipulation are
central features of antisocial personality disorder, it may be
especially helpful to integrate information acquired from systematic
clinical assessment with information collected from collateral sources.

For this diagnosis to be given, the individual must be at least age 18
years (Criterion B) and must have had a history of some symptoms of
conduct disorder before age 15 years (Criterion C). Conduct disorder
involves a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the
basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules
are violated. The specific behaviors characteristic of conduct disorder
fall into one of four categories: aggression to people and animals,
destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or serious violation of
rules.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p705}**660**

Personality Disorders

The pattern of antisocial behavior continues into adulthood. Individuals
with antisocial personality disorder fail to conform to social norms
with respect to lawful behavior (Criterion A1). They may repeatedly
perform acts that are grounds for arrest (whether they are arrested or
not), such as destroying property, harassing others, stealing, or
pursuing illegal occupations. Persons with this disorder disregard the
wishes, rights, or feelings of others. They are frequently deceitful and
manipulative in order to gain personal profit or pleasure (e.g., to
obtain money, sex, or power) (Criterion A2). They may repeatedly lie,
use an alias, con others, or malinger. A pattern of impulsivity may be
manifested by a failure to plan ahead (Criterion A3). Decisions are made
on the spur of the moment, without forethought and without consideration
for the consequences to self or others; this may lead to sudden changes
of jobs, residences, or relationships. Individuals with antisocial
personality disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and may
repeatedly get into physical fights or commit acts of physical assault
(including spouse beating or child beating) (Criterion A4). (Aggressive
acts that are required to defend oneself or someone else are not
considered to be evidence for this item.) These individuals also display
a reckless disregard for the safety of themselves or others (Criterion
A5). This may be evidenced in their driving behavior (i.e., recurrent
speeding, driving while intoxicated, multiple accidents). They may
engage in sexual behavior or substance use that has a high risk for
harmful consequences. They may neglect or fail to care for a child in a
way that puts the child in danger.

Individuals with antisocial personality disorder also tend to be
consistently and extremely irresponsible (Criterion A6). Irresponsible
work behavior may be indicated by significant periods of unemployment
despite available job opportunities, or by abandonment of several jobs
without a realistic plan for getting another job. There may also be a
pattern of repeated absences from work that are not explained by illness
either in themselves or in their family. Financial irresponsibility is
indicated by acts such as defaulting on debts, failing to provide child
support, or failing to support other dependents on a regular basis.
Individuals with antisocial personality disorder show little remorse for
the consequences of their acts (Criterion A7). They may be indifferent
to, or provide a superficial rationaliza-tion for, having hurt,
mistreated, or stolen from someone (e.g., "life's unfair," "losers
deserve to lose"). These individuals may blame the victims for being
foolish, helpless, or deserving their fate (e.g., "he had it coming
anyway"); they may minimize the harmful consequences of their actions;
or they may simply indicate complete indifference. They generally fail
to compensate or make amends for their behavior. They may believe that
everyone is out to "help number one" and that one should stop at nothing
to avoid being pushed around.

The antisocial behavior must not occur exclusively during the course of
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with antisocial personality disorder frequently lack empathy
and tend to be callous, cynical, and contemptuous of the feelings,
rights, and sufferings of others. They may have an inflated and arrogant
self-appraisal (e.g., feel that ordinary work is beneath them or lack a
realistic concern about their current problems or their future) and may
be excessively opinionated, self-assured, or cocky. They may display a
glib, superficial charm and can be quite voluble and verbally facile
(e.g., using technical terms or jargon that might impress someone who is
unfamiliar with the topic). Lack of empathy, inflated self-appraisal,
and superficial charm are features that have been commonly included in
traditional conceptions of psychopathy that may be particularly
distinguishing of the disorder and more predictive of recidivism in
prison or forensic settings, where criminal, delinquent, or aggressive
acts are likely to be nonspecific. These individuals may also be
irresponsible and exploitative in their sexual relationships. They may
have a history of many []{#index_split_072.html#p706}Antisocial
Personality Disorder

**661**

sexual partners and may never have sustained a monogamous relationship.
They may be irresponsible as parents, as evidenced by malnutrition of a
child, an illness in the child resulting from a lack of minimal hygiene,
a child's dependence on neighbors or nonresident relatives for food or
shelter, a failure to arrange for a caretaker for a young child when the
individual is away from home, or repeated squandering of money required
for household necessities. These individuals may receive dishonorable
discharges from the armed services, may fail to be self-supporting, may
become impoverished or even homeless, or may spend many years in penal
institutions. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder are more
likely than people in the general population to die prematurely by
violent means (e.g., suicide, accidents, homicides).

Individuals with antisocial personality disorder may also experience
dysphoria, including complaints of tension, inability to tolerate
boredom, and depressed mood. They may have associated anxiety disorders,
depressive disorders, substance use disorders, somatic symptom disorder,
gambling disorder, and other disorders of impulse control. Individuals
with antisocial personality disorder also often have personality
features that meet criteria for other personality disorders,
particularly borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality
disorders. The likelihood of developing antisocial personality disorder
in adult life is increased if the individual experienced childhood onset
of conduct disorder (before age 10 years) and accompanying
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Child abuse or neglect, unstable or erratic parenting, or inconsistent
parental discipline may increase the likelihood that conduct disorder
will evolve into antisocial personality disorder.

Prevalence

Twelve-month prevalence rates of antisocial personality disorder, using
criteria from previous DSMs, are between 0.2% and 3.3%. The highest
prevalence of antisocial personality disorder (greater than 70%) is
among most severe samples of males with alcohol use disorder and from
substance abuse clinics, prisons, or other forensic settings. Prevalence
is higher in samples affected by adverse socioeconomic (i.e., poverty)
or sociocultural (i.e., migration) factors.

Development and Course

Antisocial personality disorder has a chronic course but may become less
evident or remit as the individual grows older, particularly by the
fourth decade of life. Although this remission tends to be particularly
evident with respect to engaging in criminal behavior, there is likely
to be a decrease in the full spectrum of antisocial behaviors and
substance use. By definition, antisocial personality cannot be diagnosed
before age 18 years.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Antisocial personality disorder is more common among the first-degree
biological relatives of those with the disorder than in the general
population.

The risk to biological relatives of females with the disorder tends to
be higher than the risk to biological relatives of males with the
disorder. Biological relatives of individuals with this disorder are
also at increased risk for somatic symptom disorder and substance use
disorders. Within a family that has a member with antisocial personality
disorder, males more often have antisocial personality disorder and
substance use disorders, whereas females more often have somatic symptom
disorder. However, in such families, there is an increase in prevalence
of all of these disorders in both males and females compared with the
general population. Adoption studies indicate that both genetic and
environmental factors contribute to the risk of developing antisocial
personality disorder. Both adopted and biological children of parents
with antisocial personality disorder have an increased
[]{#index_split_072.html#p707}**662**

Personality Disorders

risk of developing antisocial personality disorder, somatic symptom
disorder, and substance use disorders. Adopted-away children resemble
their biological parents more than their adoptive parents, but the
adoptive family environment influences the risk of developing a
personality disorder and related psychopathology.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Antisocial personality disorder appears to be associated with low
socioeconomic status and urban settings. Concerns have been raised that
the diagnosis may at times be misapplied to individuals in settings in
which seemingly antisocial behavior may be part of a protective survival
strategy. In assessing antisocial traits, it is helpful for the
clinician to consider the social and economic context in which the
behaviors occur.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Antisocial personality disorder is much more common in males than in
females. There has been some concern that antisocial personality
disorder may be underdiagnosed in females, particularly because of the
emphasis on aggressive items in the definition of conduct disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

The diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is not given to
individuals younger than 18 years and is given only if there is a
history of some symptoms of conduct disorder before age 15 years. For
individuals older than 18 years, a diagnosis of conduct disorder is
given only if the criteria for antisocial personality disorder are not
met.

Substance use disorders.

When antisocial behavior in an adult is associated with a substance use
disorder, the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is not made
unless the signs of antisocial personality disorder were also present in
childhood and have continued into adulthood. When substance use and
antisocial behavior both began in childhood and continued into
adulthood, both a substance use disorder and antisocial personality
disorder should be diagnosed if the criteria for both are met, even
though some antisocial acts may be a consequence of the substance use
disorder (e.g., illegal selling of drugs, thefts to obtain money for
drugs).

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.

Antisocial behavior that occurs exclusively during the course of
schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder should not be diagnosed as
antisocial personality disorder.

Other personality disorders.

Other personality disorders may be confused with antisocial personality
disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore
important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in
their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in
addition to antisocial personality disorder, all can be diagnosed.
Individuals with antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic
personality disorder share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib,
superficial, exploitative, and lack empathy.

However, narcissistic personality disorder does not include
characteristics of impulsivity, aggression, and deceit. In addition,
individuals with antisocial personality disorder may not be as needy of
the admiration and envy of others, and persons with narcissistic
personality disorder usually lack the history of conduct disorder in
childhood or criminal behavior in adulthood. Individuals with antisocial
personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder share a
tendency to be impulsive, superficial, excitement seeking, reckless,
seductive, and manipulative, but persons with histrionic personality
disorder tend to be more exaggerated in their emotions and do not
characteristically engage in antisocial behaviors. Individuals with
histrionic and borderline personality disorders are
[]{#index_split_072.html#p708}Borderline Personality Disorder

**663**

manipulative to gain nurturance, whereas those with antisocial
personality disorder are manipulative to gain profit, power, or some
other material gratification. Individuals with antisocial personality
disorder tend to be less emotionally unstable and more aggressive than
those with borderline personality disorder. Although antisocial behavior
may be present in some individuals with paranoid personality disorder,
it is not usually motivated by a desire for personal gain or to exploit
others as in antisocial personality disorder, but rather is more often
attributable to a desire for revenge.

Criminal behavior not associated with a personality disorder.

Antisocial personality

disorder must be distinguished from criminal behavior undertaken for
gain that is not accompanied by the personality features characteristic
of this disorder. Only when antisocial personality traits are
inflexible, maladaptive, and persistent and cause significant functional
impairment or subjective distress do they constitute antisocial
personality disorder.

Borderline Personality Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**301.83 (F60.3)**

A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships,
self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, beginning by early
adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or
more) of the following:

1\. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. (**Note:** Do
not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion
5.)

2\. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships
characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and
devaluation.

3\. Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image
or sense of self.

4\. Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging
(e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating).
(**Note:** Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered
in Criterion 5.)

5\. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or
self-mutilating behavior.

6\. Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g.,
intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a
few hours and only rarely more than a few days).

7\. Chronic feelings of emptiness.

8\. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g.,
frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).

9\. Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative
symptoms.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of borderline personality disorder is a pervasive
pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and
affects, and marked impulsivity that begins by early adulthood and is
present in a variety of contexts.

Individuals with borderline personality disorder make frantic efforts to
avoid real or imagined abandonment (Criterion 1). The perception of
impending separation or rejection, or the loss of external structure,
can lead to profound changes in self-image, affect, cognition, and
behavior. These individuals are very sensitive to environmental
circumstances. They experience intense abandonment fears and
inappropriate anger even when faced with a realistic time-limited
separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans (e.g., sudden
despair in reaction to a clinician's announcing the end of the hour;
panic or fury when someone important to them is just a few minutes late
or must cancel an appointment). They may believe that this "abandonment"
implies they are "bad." These abandonment fears are related to an
intolerance of being alone and a need to have other people with them.
Their frantic []{#index_split_072.html#p709}**664**

Personality Disorders

efforts to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as
self-mutilating or suicidal behaviors, which are described separately in
Criterion 5.

Individuals with borderline personality disorder have a pattern of
unstable and intense relationships (Criterion 2). They may idealize
potential caregivers or lovers at the first or second meeting, demand to
spend a lot of time together, and share the most intimate details early
in a relationship. However, they may switch quickly from idealizing
other people to devaluing them, feeling that the other person does not
care enough, does not give enough, or is not "there" enough. These
individuals can empathize with and nurture other people, but only with
the expectation that the other person will "be there" in return to meet
their own needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden and
dramatic shifts in their view of others, who may alternatively be seen
as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive.

Such shifts often reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose
nurturing qualities had been idealized or whose rejection or abandonment
is expected.

There may be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and
persistently unstable self-image or sense of self (Criterion 3). There
are sudden and dramatic shifts in self-image, characterized by shifting
goals, values, and vocational aspirations. There may be sudden changes
in opinions and plans about career, sexual identity, values, and types
of friends. These individuals may suddenly change from the role of a
needy supplicant for help to that of a righteous avenger of past
mistreatment. Although they usually have a self-image that is based on
being bad or evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have
feelings that they do not exist at all. Such experiences usually occur
in situations in which the individual feels a lack of a meaningful
relationship, nurturing, and support. These individuals may show worse
performance in unstructured work or school situations.

Individuals with borderline personality disorder display impulsivity in
at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (Criterion 4).
They may gamble, spend money irresponsibly, binge eat, abuse substances,
engage in unsafe sex, or drive recklessly. Individuals with this
disorder display recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or
self-mutilating behavior (Criterion 5). Completed suicide occurs in
8%--10% of such individuals, and self-mutilative acts (e.g., cutting or
burning) and suicide threats and attempts are very common. Recurrent
suicidality is often the reason that these individuals present for help.

These self-destructive acts are usually precipitated by threats of
separation or rejection or by expectations that the individual assumes
increased responsibility. Self-mutilation may occur during dissociative
experiences and often brings relief by reaffirming the ability to feel
or by expiating the individual's sense of being evil.

Individuals with borderline personality disorder may display affective
instability that is due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense
episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours
and only rarely more than a few days) (Criterion 6). The basic dysphoric
mood of those with borderline personality disorder is often disrupted by
periods of anger, panic, or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of
well-being or satisfaction. These episodes may reflect the individual's
extreme reactivity to interpersonal stresses. Individuals with
borderline personality disorder may be troubled by chronic feelings of
emptiness (Criterion 7). Easily bored, they may constantly seek
something to do.

Individuals with this disorder frequently express inappropriate, intense
anger or have difficulty controlling their anger (Criterion 8). They may
display extreme sarcasm, enduring bitterness, or verbal outbursts. The
anger is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen as neglectful,
withholding, uncaring, or abandoning. Such expressions of anger are
often followed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they
have of being evil. During periods of extreme stress, transient paranoid
ideation or dissociative symptoms (e.g., depersonalization) may occur
(Criterion 9), but these are generally of insufficient severity or
duration to warrant an additional diagnosis. These episodes occur most
frequently in response to a real or imagined abandonment. Symptoms tend
to be transient, lasting minutes or hours. The real or perceived return
of the caregiver's nurturance may result in a remission of symptoms.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p710}Borderline Personality Disorder

**665**

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with borderline personality disorder may have a pattern of
undermining themselves at the moment a goal is about to be realized
(e.g., dropping out of school just before graduation; regressing
severely after a discussion of how well therapy is going; destroying a
good relationship just when it is clear that the relationship could
last). Some individuals develop psychotic-like symptoms (e.g.,
hallucinations, body-image distortions, ideas of reference, hypnagogic
phenomena) during times of stress. Individuals with this disorder may
feel more secure with transitional objects (i.e., a pet or inanimate
possession) than in interpersonal relationships. Premature death from
suicide may occur in individuals with this disorder, especially in those
with co-occurring depressive disorders or substance use disorders.
Physical handicaps may result from self-inflicted abuse behaviors or
failed suicide attempts. Recurrent job losses, interrupted education,
and separation or divorce are common. Physical and sexual abuse,
neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental loss are more common in
the childhood histories of those with borderline personality disorder.
Common co-occurring disorders include depressive and bipolar disorders,
substance use disorders, eating disorders (notably bulimia nervosa),
posttraumatic stress disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder. Borderline personality disorder also frequently co-occurs with
the other personality disorders.

Prevalence

The median population prevalence of borderline personality disorder is
estimated to be 1.6% but may be as high as 5.9%. The prevalence of
borderline personality disorder is about 6% in primary care settings,
about 10% among individuals seen in outpatient mental health clinics,
and about 20% among psychiatric inpatients. The prevalence of borderline
personality disorder may decrease in older age groups.

Development and Course

There is considerable variability in the course of borderline
personality disorder. The most common pattern is one of chronic
instability in early adulthood, with episodes of serious affective and
impulsive dyscontrol and high levels of use of health and mental health
resources. The impairment from the disorder and the risk of suicide are
greatest in the young-adult years and gradually wane with advancing age.
Although the tendency toward intense emotions, impulsivity, and
intensity in relationships is often lifelong, individuals who engage in
therapeutic intervention often show improvement beginning sometime
during the first year. During their 30s and 40s, the majority of
individuals with this disorder attain greater stability in their
relationships and vocational functioning. Follow-up studies of
individuals identified through outpatient mental health clinics indicate
that after about 10 years, as many as half of the individuals no longer
have a pattern of behavior that meets full criteria for borderline
personality disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Borderline personality disorder is about five times more common among
first-degree biological relatives of those with the disorder than in the
general population. There is also an increased familial risk for
substance use disorders, antisocial personality disorder, and depressive
or bipolar disorders.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The pattern of behavior seen in borderline personality disorder has been
identified in many settings around the world. Adolescents and young
adults with identity problems (especially when accompanied by substance
use) may transiently display behaviors that misleadingly

[]{#index_split_072.html#p711}**666**

Personality Disorders

give the impression of borderline personality disorder. Such situations
are characterized by emotional instability, "existential" dilemmas,
uncertainty, anxiety-provoking choices, conflicts about sexual
orientation, and competing social pressures to decide on careers.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Borderline personality disorder is diagnosed predominantly (about 75%)
in females.

Differential Diagnosis

Depressive and bipolar disorders.

Borderline personality disorder often co-occurs with

depressive or bipolar disorders, and when criteria for both are met,
both may be diagnosed.

Because the cross-sectional presentation of borderline personality
disorder can be mimicked by an episode of depressive or bipolar
disorder, the clinician should avoid giving an additional diagnosis of
borderline personality disorder based only on cross-sectional
presentation without having documented that the pattern of behavior had
an early onset and a long-standing course.

Other personality disorders.

Other personality disorders may be confused with borderline personality
disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore
important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in
their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in
addition to borderline personality disorder, all can be diagnosed.
Although histrionic personality disorder can also be characterized by
attention seeking, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions,
borderline personality disorder is distinguished by
self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships, and
chronic feelings of deep emptiness and loneliness. Paranoid ideas or
illusions may be present in both borderline personality disorder and
schizotypal personality disorder, but these symptoms are more transient,
interpersonally reactive, and responsive to external structuring in
borderline personality disorder. Although paranoid personality disorder
and narcissistic personality disorder may also be characterized by an
angry reaction to minor stimuli, the relative stability of self-image,
as well as the relative lack of self-destructiveness, impulsivity, and
abandonment concerns, distinguishes these disorders from borderline
personality disorder. Although antisocial personality disorder and
borderline personality disorder are both characterized by manipulative
behavior, individuals with antisocial personality disorder are
manipulative to gain profit, power, or some other material
gratification, whereas the goal in borderline personality disorder is
directed more toward gaining the concern of caretakers. Both dependent
personality disorder and borderline personality disorder are
characterized by fear of abandonment; however, the individual with
borderline personality disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of
emotional emptiness, rage, and demands, whereas the individual with
dependent personality disorder reacts with increasing appeasement and
submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement relationship to provide
caregiving and support. Borderline personality disorder can further be
distinguished from dependent personality disorder by the typical pattern
of unstable and intense relationships.

Personality change due to another medical condition.

Borderline personality disorder must be distinguished from personality
change due to another medical condition, in which the traits that emerge
are attributable to the effects of another medical condition on the
central nervous system.

Substance use disorders.

Borderline personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms
that may develop in association with persistent substance use.

Identity problems.

Borderline personality disorder should be distinguished from an identity
problem, which is reserved for identity concerns related to a
developmental phase (e.g., adolescence) and does not qualify as a mental
disorder.

[]{#index_split_072.html#p712}Histrionic Personality Disorder

**667**

Histrionic Personality Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**301.50 (F60.4)**

A pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking,
beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as
indicated by five (or more) of the following: 1. Is uncomfortable in
situations in which he or she is not the center of attention.

2\. Interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate
sexually seductive or provocative behavior.

3\. Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions.

4\. Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self.

5\. Has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and
lacking in detail.

6\. Shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression
of emotion.

7\. Is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances).

8\. Considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of histrionic personality disorder is pervasive
and excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior. This pattern
begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.

[]{#index_split_073.html}

Individuals with histrionic personality disorder are uncomfortable or
feel unappreciated when they are not the center of attention (Criterion
1). Often lively and dramatic, they tend to draw attention to themselves
and may initially charm new acquaintances by their enthusiasm, apparent
openness, or flirtatiousness. These qualities wear thin, however, as
these individuals continually demand to be the center of attention. They
commandeer the role of "the life of the party." If they are not the
center of attention, they may do something dramatic (e.g., make up
stories, create a scene) to draw the focus of attention to themselves.

This need is often apparent in their behavior with a clinician (e.g.,
being flattering, bringing gifts, providing dramatic descriptions of
physical and psychological symptoms that are replaced by new symptoms
each visit).

The appearance and behavior of individuals with this disorder are often
inappropriately sexually provocative or seductive (Criterion 2). This
behavior not only is directed toward persons in whom the individual has
a sexual or romantic interest but also occurs in a wide variety of
social, occupational, and professional relationships beyond what is
appropriate for the social context. Emotional expression may be shallow
and rapidly shifting (Criterion 3). Individuals with this disorder
consistently use physical appearance to draw attention to themselves
(Criterion 4). They are overly concerned with impressing others by their
appearance and expend an excessive amount of time, energy, and money on
clothes and grooming. They may "fish for compliments" regarding
appearance and may be easily and excessively upset by a critical comment
about how they look or by a photograph that they regard as unflattering.

These individuals have a style of speech that is excessively
impressionistic and lacking in detail (Criterion 5). Strong opinions are
expressed with dramatic flair, but underlying reasons are usually vague
and diffuse, without supporting facts and details. For example, an
individual with histrionic personality disorder may comment that a
certain individual is a wonderful human being, yet be unable to provide
any specific examples of good qualities to support this opinion.
Individuals with this disorder are characterized by self-dramatization,
theatricality, and an exaggerated expression of emotion (Criterion 6).
They may embarrass friends and acquaintances by an excessive public
display of emotions (e.g., embracing casual acquaintances with excessive
ardor, sobbing uncontrollably on minor
[]{#index_split_073.html#p713}**668**

Personality Disorders

sentimental occasions, having temper tantrums). However, their emotions
often seem to be turned on and off too quickly to be deeply felt, which
may lead others to accuse the individual of faking these feelings.

Individuals with histrionic personality disorder have a high degree of
suggestibility (Criterion 7). Their opinions and feelings are easily
influenced by others and by current fads.

They may be overly trusting, especially of strong authority figures whom
they see as magically solving their problems. They have a tendency to
play hunches and to adopt convictions quickly. Individuals with this
disorder often consider relationships more intimate than they actually
are, describing almost every acquaintance as "my dear, dear friend" or
referring to physicians met only once or twice under professional
circumstances by their first names (Criterion 8).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with histrionic personality disorder may have difficulty
achieving emotional intimacy in romantic or sexual relationships.
Without being aware of it, they often act out a role (e.g., "victim" or
"princess") in their relationships to others. They may seek to control
their partner through emotional manipulation or seductiveness on one
level, while displaying a marked dependency on them at another level.
Individuals with this disorder often have impaired relationships with
same-sex friends because their sexually provocative interpersonal style
may seem a threat to their friends' relationships. These individuals may
also alienate friends with demands for constant attention. They often
become depressed and upset when they are not the center of attention.
They may crave novelty, stimulation, and excitement and have a tendency
to become bored with their usual routine. These individuals are often
intolerant of, or frustrated by, situations that involve delayed
gratification, and their actions are often directed at obtaining
immediate satisfaction. Although they often initiate a job or project
with great enthusiasm, their interest may lag quickly. Longer-term
relationships may be neglected to make way for the excitement of new
relationships.

The actual risk of suicide is not known, but clinical experience
suggests that individuals with this disorder are at increased risk for
suicidal gestures and threats to get attention and coerce better
caregiving. Histrionic personality disorder has been associated with
higher rates of somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder
(functional neurological symptom disorder), and major depressive
disorder. Borderline, narcissistic, antisocial, and dependent
personality disorders often co-occur.

Prevalence

Data from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and
Related Conditions suggest a prevalence of histrionic personality of
1.84%.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Norms for interpersonal behavior, personal appearance, and emotional
expressiveness vary widely across cultures, genders, and age groups.
Before considering the various traits (e.g., emotionality,
seductiveness, dramatic interpersonal style, novelty seeking,
sociability, charm, impressionability, a tendency to somatization) to be
evidence of histrionic personality disorder, it is important to evaluate
whether they cause clinically significant impairment or distress.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

In clinical settings, this disorder has been diagnosed more frequently
in females; however, the sex ratio is not significantly different from
the sex ratio of females within the respective clinical setting. In
contrast, some studies using structured assessments report similar
prevalence rates among males and females.

Differential Diagnosis

Other personality disorders and personality traits.

Other personality disorders may

be confused with histrionic personality disorder because they have
certain features in common. It is therefore important to distinguish
among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic
features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet
criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to histrionic
personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although borderline
personality disorder can also be characterized by attention seeking,
manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions, it is
distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close
relationships, and chronic feelings of deep emptiness and identity
disturbance. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder and
histrionic personality disorder share a tendency to be impulsive,
superficial, excitement seeking, reckless, seductive, and manipulative,
but persons with histrionic personality disorder tend to be more
exaggerated in their emotions and do not characteristically engage in
antisocial behaviors. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder
are manipulative to gain nurturance, whereas those with antisocial
personality disorder are manipulative to gain profit, power, or some
other material gratification. Although individuals with narcissistic
personality disorder also crave attention from others, they usually want
praise for their "superiority," whereas individuals with histrionic
personality disorder are willing to be viewed as fragile or dependent if
this is instrumental in getting attention. Individuals with narcissistic
personality disorder may exaggerate the intimacy of their relationships
with other people, but they are more apt to emphasize the "VIP" status
or wealth of their friends. In dependent personality disorder, the
individual is excessively dependent on others for praise and guidance,
but is without the flamboyant, exaggerated, emotional features of
individuals with histrionic personality disorder.

Many individuals may display histrionic personality traits. Only when
these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause
significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they
constitute histrionic personality disorder.

Personality change due to another medical condition.

Histrionic personality disorder

must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical
condition, in which the traits that emerge are attributable to the
effects of another medical condition on the central nervous system.

Substance use disorders.

The disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop
in association with persistent substance use.

Personality Disorders

6\. Is interpersonally exploitative (i.e., takes advantage of others to
achieve his or her own ends).

7\. Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the
feelings and needs of others.

8\. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of
him or her.

9\. Shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a
pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of
empathy that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of
contexts.

Individuals with this disorder have a grandiose sense of self-importance
(Criterion 1).

They routinely overestimate their abilities and inflate their
accomplishments, often appearing boastful and pretentious. They may
blithely assume that others attribute the same value to their efforts
and may be surprised when the praise they expect and feel they deserve
is not forthcoming. Often implicit in the inflated judgments of their
own accomplishments is an underestimation (devaluation) of the
contributions of others. Individuals with narcissistic personality
disorder are often preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success,
power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love (Criterion 2). They may
ruminate about "long overdue" admiration and privilege and compare
themselves favorably with famous or privileged people.

Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they are
superior, special, or unique and expect others to recognize them as such
(Criterion 3). They may feel that they can only be understood by, and
should only associate with, other people who are special or of high
status and may attribute "unique," "perfect," or "gifted" qualities to
those with whom they associate. Individuals with this disorder believe
that their needs are special and beyond the ken of ordinary people.
Their own self-esteem is enhanced (i.e., "mirrored") by the idealized
value that they assign to those with whom they associate. They are
likely to insist on having only the "top" person (doctor, lawyer,
hairdresser, instructor) or being affiliated with the "best"
institutions but may devalue the credentials of those who disappoint
them.

Individuals with this disorder generally require excessive admiration
(Criterion 4). Their self-esteem is almost invariably very fragile. They
may be preoccupied with how well they are doing and how favorably they
are regarded by others. This often takes the form of a need for constant
attention and admiration. They may expect their arrival to be greeted
with great fanfare and are astonished if others do not covet their
possessions. They may constantly fish for compliments, often with great
charm. A sense of entitlement is evident in these individuals'
unreasonable expectation of especially favorable treatment (Criterion
5). They expect to be catered to and are puzzled or furious when this
does not happen. For example, they may assume that they do not have to
wait in line and that their priorities are so important that others
should defer to them, and then get irritated when others fail to assist
"in their very important work." This sense of entitlement, combined with
a lack of sensitivity to the wants and needs of others, may result in
the conscious or unwitting exploitation of others (Criterion 6). They
expect to be given whatever they want or feel they need, no matter what
it might mean to others. For example, these individuals may expect great
dedication from others and may overwork them without regard for the
impact on their lives. They tend to form friendships or romantic
relationships only if the other person seems likely to advance their
purposes or otherwise enhance their self-esteem. They often usurp
special privileges and extra resources that they believe they deserve
because they are so special.

Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder generally have a lack
of empathy and have difficulty recognizing the desires, subjective
experiences, and feelings of others (Criterion 7). They may assume that
others are totally concerned about their welfare. They tend to discuss
their own concerns in inappropriate and lengthy detail, while failing to
recognize that others also have feelings and needs. They are often
contemptuous and impatient with
[]{#index_split_073.html#p716}Narcissistic Personality Disorder

**671**

others who talk about their own problems and concerns. These individuals
may be oblivious to the hurt their remarks may inflict (e.g.,
exuberantly telling a former lover that "I am now in the relationship of
a lifetime!"; boasting of health in front of someone who is sick). When
recognized, the needs, desires, or feelings of others are likely to be
viewed disparagingly as signs of weakness or vulnerability. Those who
relate to individuals with narcissistic personality disorder typically
find an emotional coldness and lack of reciprocal interest.

These individuals are often envious of others or believe that others are
envious of them (Criterion 8). They may begrudge others their successes
or possessions, feeling that they better deserve those achievements,
admiration, or privileges. They may harshly devalue the contributions of
others, particularly when those individuals have received acknowledgment
or praise for their accomplishments. Arrogant, haughty behaviors
characterize these individuals; they often display snobbish, disdainful,
or patronizing attitudes (Criterion 9). For example, an individual with
this disorder may complain about a clumsy waiter's "rudeness" or
"stupidity"

or conclude a medical evaluation with a condescending evaluation of the
physician.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic
personality disorder very sensitive to "injury" from criticism or
defeat. Although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may haunt
these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded,
hollow, and empty. They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant
counterattack. Such experiences often lead to social withdrawal or an
appearance of humility that may mask and protect the grandiosity.
Interpersonal relations are typically impaired because of problems
derived from entitlement, the need for admiration, and the relative
disregard for the sensitivities of others. Though overweening ambition
and confidence may lead to high achievement, performance may be
disrupted because of intolerance of criticism or defeat.

Sometimes vocational functioning can be very low, reflecting an
unwillingness to take a risk in competitive or other situations in which
defeat is possible. Sustained feelings of shame or humiliation and the
attendant self-criticism may be associated with social withdrawal,
depressed mood, and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) or major
depressive disorder. In contrast, sustained periods of grandiosity may
be associated with a hypomanic mood. Narcissistic personality disorder
is also associated with anorexia nervosa and substance use disorders
(especially related to cocaine). Histrionic, borderline, antisocial, and
paranoid personality disorders may be associated with narcissistic
personality disorder.

Prevalence

Prevalence estimates for narcissistic personality disorder, based on
DSM-IV definitions, range from 0% to 6.2% in community samples.

Development and Course

Narcissistic traits may be particularly common in adolescents and do not
necessarily indicate that the individual will go on to have narcissistic
personality disorder. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder
may have special difficulties adjusting to the onset of physical and
occupational limitations that are inherent in the aging process.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Of those diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, 50%--75% are
male.

Personality Disorders

common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders
based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an
individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more
personality disorders in addition to narcissistic personality disorder,
all can be diagnosed. The most useful feature in discriminating
narcissistic personality disorder from histrionic, antisocial, and
borderline personality disorders, in which the interactive styles are
coquettish, callous, and needy, respectively, is the grandiosity
characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder. The relative
stability of self-image as well as the relative lack of
self-destructiveness, impulsivity, and abandonment concerns also help
distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from borderline
personality disorder. Excessive pride in achievements, a relative lack
of emotional display, and disdain for others' sensitivities help
distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from histrionic
personality disorder. Although individuals with borderline, histrionic,
and narcissistic personality disorders may require much attention, those
with narcissistic personality disorder specifically need that attention
to be admiring. Individuals with antisocial and narcissistic personality
disorders share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial,
exploitative, and unempathic. However, narcissistic personality disorder
does not necessarily include characteristics of impulsivity, aggression,
and deceit. In addition, individuals with antisocial personality
disorder may not be as needy of the admiration and envy of others, and
persons with narcissistic personality disorder usually lack the history
of conduct disorder in childhood or criminal behavior in adulthood. In
both narcissistic personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder, the individual may profess a commitment to
perfectionism and believe that others cannot do things as well. In
contrast to the accompanying self-criticism of those with
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, individuals with narcissistic
personality disorder are more likely to believe that they have achieved
perfection. Suspiciousness and social withdrawal usually distinguish
those with schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder from those with
narcissistic personality disorder. When these qualities are present in
individuals with narcissistic personality disorder, they derive
primarily from fears of having imperfections or flaws revealed.

Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might
be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible,
maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment
or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic personality
disorder.

Mania or hypomania.

Grandiosity may emerge as part of manic or hypomanic episodes, but the
association with mood change or functional impairments helps distinguish
these episodes from narcissistic personality disorder.

Substance use disorders.

Narcissistic personality disorder must also be distinguished from
symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.

**Cluster C Personality Disorders**

Avoidant Personality Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**301.82 (F60.6)**

A pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and
hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, beginning by early adulthood
and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of
the following:

1\. Avoids occupational activities that involve significant
interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism, disapproval, or
rejection.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p718}Avoidant Personality Disorder

2\. Is unwilling to get involved with people unless certain of being

3\. Shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of
being shamed or ridiculed.

4\. Is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social
situations.

5\. Is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of
inadequacy.

6\. Views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to
others.

7\. Is unusually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any
new activities because they may prove embarrassing.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of avoidant personality disorder is a pervasive
pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and
hypersensitivity to negative evaluation that begins by early adulthood
and is present in a variety of contexts.

Individuals with avoidant personality disorder avoid work activities
that involve significant interpersonal contact because of fears of
criticism, disapproval, or rejection (Criterion 1). Offers of job
promotions may be declined because the new responsibilities might result
in criticism from coworkers. These individuals avoid making new friends
unless they are certain they will be liked and accepted without
criticism (Criterion 2). Until they pass stringent tests proving the
contrary, other people are assumed to be critical and disapproving.
Individuals with this disorder will not join in group activities unless
there are repeated and generous offers of support and nurturance.
Interpersonal intimacy is often difficult for these individuals,
although they are able to establish intimate relationships when there is
assurance of uncritical acceptance. They may act with restraint, have
difficulty talking about themselves, and withhold intimate feelings for
fear of being exposed, ridiculed, or shamed (Criterion 3).

Because individuals with this disorder are preoccupied with being
criticized or rejected in social situations, they may have a markedly
low threshold for detecting such reactions (Criterion 4). If someone is
even slightly disapproving or critical, they may feel extremely hurt.
They tend to be shy, quiet, inhibited, and "invisible" because of the
fear that any attention would be degrading or rejecting. They expect
that no matter what they say, others will see it as "wrong," and so they
may say nothing at all. They react strongly to subtle cues that are
suggestive of mockery or derision. Despite their longing to be active
participants in social life, they fear placing their welfare in the
hands of others. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder are
inhibited in new interpersonal situations because they feel inadequate
and have low self-esteem (Criterion 5). Doubts concerning social
competence and personal appeal become especially manifest in settings
involving interactions with strangers. These individuals believe
themselves to be socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to
others (Criterion 6). They are unusually reluctant to take personal
risks or to engage in any new activities because these may prove
embarrassing (Criterion 7). They are prone to exaggerate the potential
dangers of ordinary situations, and a restricted lifestyle may result
from their need for certainty and security. Someone with this disorder
may cancel a job interview for fear of being embarrassed by not dressing
appropriately. Marginal somatic symptoms or other problems may become
the reason for avoiding new activities.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with avoidant personality disorder often vigilantly appraise
the movements and expressions of those with whom they come into contact.
Their fearful and tense demeanor may elicit ridicule and derision from
others, which in turn confirms their self-doubts. These individuals are
very anxious about the possibility that they will react to criticism
with blushing or crying. They are described by others as being "shy,"
"timid,"

[]{#index_split_073.html#p719}**674**

Personality Disorders

"lonely," and "isolated." The major problems associated with this
disorder occur in social and occupational functioning. The low
self-esteem and hypersensitivity to rejection are associated with
restricted interpersonal contacts. These individuals may become
relatively isolated and usually do not have a large social support
network that can help them weather crises. They desire affection and
acceptance and may fantasize about idealized relationships with others.
The avoidant behaviors can also adversely affect occupational
functioning because these individuals try to avoid the types of social
situations that may be important for meeting the basic demands of the
job or for advancement.

Other disorders that are commonly diagnosed with avoidant personality
disorder include depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders, especially
social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Avoidant personality disorder
is often diagnosed with dependent personality disorder, because
individuals with avoidant personality disorder become very attached to
and dependent on those few other people with whom they are friends.
Avoidant personality disorder also tends to be diagnosed with borderline
personality disorder and with the Cluster A personality disorders (i.e.,
paranoid, schizoid, or schizotypal personality disorders).

Prevalence

Data from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and
Related Conditions suggest a prevalence of about 2.4% for avoidant
personality disorder.

Development and Course

The avoidant behavior often starts in infancy or childhood with shyness,
isolation, and fear of strangers and new situations. Although shyness in
childhood is a common precursor of avoidant personality disorder, in
most individuals it tends to gradually dissipate as they get older. In
contrast, individuals who go on to develop avoidant personality disorder
may become increasingly shy and avoidant during adolescence and early
adulthood, when social relationships with new people become especially
important. There is some evidence that in adults, avoidant personality
disorder tends to become less evident or to remit with age. This
diagnosis should be used with great caution in children and adolescents,
for whom shy and avoidant behavior may be developmentally appropriate.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

There may be variation in the degree to which different cultural and
ethnic groups regard diffidence and avoidance as appropriate. Moreover,
avoidant behavior may be the result of problems in acculturation
following immigration.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Avoidant personality disorder appears to be equally frequent in males
and females.

Differential Diagnosis

Anxiety disorders.

There appears to be a great deal of overlap between avoidant personality
disorder and social anxiety disorder (social phobia), so much so that
they may be alternative conceptualizations of the same or similar
conditions. Avoidance also characterizes both avoidant personality
disorder and agoraphobia, and they often co-occur.

Other personality disorders and personality traits.

Other personality disorders may

be confused with avoidant personality disorder because they have certain
features in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among
these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features.
However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria
for one or more personality disorders in addition to avoidant
personality dis-

[]{#index_split_073.html#p720}Dependent Personality Disorder

**675**

order, all can be diagnosed. Both avoidant personality disorder and
dependent personality disorder are characterized by feelings of
inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and a need for reassurance.
Although the primary focus of concern in avoidant personality disorder
is avoidance of humiliation and rejection, in dependent personality
disorder the focus is on being taken care of. However, avoidant
personality disorder and dependent personality disorder are particularly
likely to co-occur. Like avoidant personality disorder, schizoid
personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder are
characterized by social isolation. However, individuals with avoidant
personality disorder want to have relationships with others and feel
their loneliness deeply, whereas those with schizoid or schizotypal
personality disorder may be content with and even prefer their social
isolation. Paranoid personality disorder and avoidant personality
disorder are both characterized by a reluctance to confide in others.
However, in avoidant personality disorder, this reluctance is
attributable more to a fear of being embarrassed or being found
inadequate than to a fear of others' malicious intent.

Many individuals display avoidant personality traits. Only when these
traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant
functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute avoidant
personality disorder.

Personality change due to another medical condition.

Avoidant personality disorder

must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical
condition, in which the traits that emerge are attributable to the
effects of another medical condition on the central nervous system.

Substance use disorders.

Avoidant personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms
that may develop in association with persistent substance use.

Dependent Personality Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**301.6 (F60.7)**

A pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to
submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation, beginning by
early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by
five (or more) of the following: 1. Has difficulty making everyday
decisions without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from
others.

2\. Needs others to assume responsibility for most major areas of his or
her life.

3\. Has difficulty expressing disagreement with others because of fear
of loss of support or approval. (**Note:** Do not include realistic
fears of retribution.) 4. Has difficulty initiating projects or doing
things on his or her own (because of a lack of self-confidence in
judgment or abilities rather than a lack of motivation or energy).

5\. Goes to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance and support from
others, to the point of volunteering to do things that are unpleasant.

6\. Feels uncomfortable or helpless when alone because of exaggerated
fears of being unable to care for himself or herself.

7\. Urgently seeks another relationship as a source of care and support
when a close relationship ends.

8\. Is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to take care
of himself or herself.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of dependent personality disorder is a pervasive
and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and
clinging behavior and fears of separation.

This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of
contexts. The dependent

[]{#index_split_073.html#p721}**676**

Personality Disorders

and submissive behaviors are designed to elicit caregiving and arise
from a self-perception of being unable to function adequately without
the help of others.

Individuals with dependent personality disorder have great difficulty
making everyday decisions (e.g., what color shirt to wear to work or
whether to carry an umbrella) without an excessive amount of advice and
reassurance from others (Criterion 1). These individuals tend to be
passive and to allow other people (often a single other person) to take
the initiative and assume responsibility for most major areas of their
lives (Criterion 2). Adults with this disorder typically depend on a
parent or spouse to decide where they should live, what kind of job they
should have, and which neighbors to befriend. Adolescents with this
disorder may allow their parent(s) to decide what they should wear, with
whom they should associate, how they should spend their free time, and
what school or college they should attend. This need for others to
assume responsibility goes beyond age-appropriate and
situation-appropriate requests for assistance from others (e.g., the
specific needs of children, elderly persons, and handicapped persons).
Dependent personality disorder may occur in an individual who has a
serious medical condition or disability, but in such cases the
difficulty in taking responsibility must go beyond what would normally
be associated with that condition or disability.

Because they fear losing support or approval, individuals with dependent
personality disorder often have difficulty expressing disagreement with
other individuals, especially those on whom they are dependent
(Criterion 3). These individuals feel so unable to function alone that
they will agree with things that they feel are wrong rather than risk
losing the help of those to whom they look for guidance. They do not get
appropriately angry at others whose support and nurturance they need for
fear of alienating them. If the individual's concerns regarding the
consequences of expressing disagreement are realistic (e.g., realistic
fears of retribution from an abusive spouse), the behavior should not be
considered to be evidence of dependent personality disorder.

Individuals with this disorder have difficulty initiating projects or
doing things independently (Criterion 4). They lack self-confidence and
believe that they need help to begin and carry through tasks. They will
wait for others to start things because they believe that as a rule
others can do them better. These individuals are convinced that they are
incapable of functioning independently and present themselves as inept
and requiring constant assistance. They are, however, likely to function
adequately if given the assurance that someone else is supervising and
approving. There may be a fear of becoming or appearing to be more
competent, because they may believe that this will lead to abandonment.
Because they rely on others to handle their problems, they often do not
learn the skills of independent living, thus perpetuating dependency.

Individuals with dependent personality disorder may go to excessive
lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others, even to the point
of volunteering for unpleasant tasks if such behavior will bring the
care they need (Criterion 5). They are willing to submit to what others
want, even if the demands are unreasonable. Their need to maintain an
important bond will often result in imbalanced or distorted
relationships. They may make extraordinary self-sacrifices or tolerate
verbal, physical, or sexual abuse. (It should be noted that this
behavior should be considered evidence of dependent personality disorder
only when it can clearly be established that other options are available
to the individual.) Individuals with this disorder feel uncomfortable or
helpless when alone, because of their exaggerated fears of being unable
to care for themselves (Criterion 6). They will "tag along"

with important others just to avoid being alone, even if they are not
interested or involved in what is happening.

When a close relationship ends (e.g., a breakup with a lover; the death
of a caregiver), individuals with dependent personality disorder may
urgently seek another relationship to provide the care and support they
need (Criterion 7). Their belief that they are unable to function in the
absence of a close relationship motivates these individuals to become
quickly and indiscriminately attached to another individual. Individuals
with this disorder are often []{#index_split_073.html#p722}Dependent
Personality Disorder

**677**

preoccupied with fears of being left to care for themselves (Criterion
8). They see themselves as so totally dependent on the advice and help
of an important other person that they worry about being abandoned by
that person when there are no grounds to justify such fears. To be
considered as evidence of this criterion, the fears must be excessive
and unrealistic. For example, an elderly man with cancer who moves into
his son's household for care is exhibiting dependent behavior that is
appropriate given this person's life circumstances.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals with dependent personality disorder are often characterized
by pessimism and self-doubt, tend to belittle their abilities and
assets, and may constantly refer to themselves as "stupid." They take
criticism and disapproval as proof of their worthlessness and lose faith
in themselves. They may seek overprotection and dominance from others.
Occupational functioning may be impaired if independent initiative is
required. They may avoid positions of responsibility and become anxious
when faced with decisions. Social relations tend to be limited to those
few people on whom the individual is dependent. There may be an
increased risk of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and
adjustment disorders. Dependent personality disorder often co-occurs
with other personality disorders, especially borderline, avoidant, and
histrionic personality disorders. Chronic physical illness or separation
anxiety disorder in childhood or adolescence may predispose the
individual to the development of this disorder.

Prevalence

Data from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and
Related Conditions yielded an estimated prevalence of dependent
personality disorder of 0.49%, and dependent personality was estimated,
based on a probability subsample from Part II of the National
Comorbidity Survey Replication, to be 0.6%.

Development and Course

This diagnosis should be used with great caution, if at all, in children
and adolescents, for whom dependent behavior may be developmentally
appropriate.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The degree to which dependent behaviors are considered to be appropriate
varies substantially across different age and sociocultural groups. Age
and cultural factors need to be considered in evaluating the diagnostic
threshold of each criterion. Dependent behavior should be considered
characteristic of the disorder only when it is clearly in excess of the
individual's cultural norms or reflects unrealistic concerns. An
emphasis on passivity, politeness, and deferential treatment is
characteristic of some societies and may be misinterpreted as traits of
dependent personality disorder. Similarly, societies may differentially
foster and discourage dependent behavior in males and females.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

In clinical settings, dependent personality disorder has been diagnosed
more frequently in females, although some studies report similar
prevalence rates among males and females.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders and medical conditions.

Dependent personality disorder must

be distinguished from dependency arising as a consequence of other
mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders, panic disorder,
agoraphobia) and as a result of other medical conditions.

Personality Disorders

Other personality disorders and personality traits.

Other personality disorders may be

confused with dependent personality disorder because they have certain
features in common. It is therefore important to distinguish among these
disorders based on differences in their characteristic features.
However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria
for one or more personality disorders in addition to dependent
personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although many personality
disorders are characterized by dependent features, dependent personality
disorder can be distinguished by its predominantly submissive, reactive,
and clinging behavior. Both dependent personality disorder and
borderline personality disorder are characterized by fear of
abandonment; however, the individual with borderline personality
disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of emotional emptiness,
rage, and demands, whereas the individual with dependent personality
disorder reacts with increasing appeasement and submissiveness and
urgently seeks a replacement relationship to provide caregiving and
support. Borderline personality disorder can further be distinguished
from dependent personality disorder by a typical pattern of unstable and
intense relationships. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder,
like those with dependent personality disorder, have a strong need for
reassurance and approval and may appear childlike and clinging. However,
unlike dependent personality disorder, which is characterized by
self-effacing and docile behavior, histrionic personality disorder is
characterized by gregarious flamboyance with active demands for
attention. Both dependent personality disorder and avoidant personality
disorder are characterized by feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity
to criticism, and a need for reassurance; however, individuals with
avoidant personality disorder have such a strong fear of humiliation and
rejection that they withdraw until they are certain they will be
accepted. In contrast, individuals with dependent personality disorder
have a pattern of seeking and maintaining connections to important
others, rather than avoiding and withdrawing from relationships.

Many individuals display dependent personality traits. Only when these
traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant
functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute
dependent personality disorder.

Personality change due to another medical condition.

Dependent personality disorder must be distinguished from personality
change due to another medical condition, in which the traits that emerge
are attributable to the effects of another medical condition on the
central nervous system.

Substance use disorders.

Dependent personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms
that may develop in association with persistent substance use.

Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**301.4 (F60.5)**

A pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism,
and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility,
openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a
variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:

1\. Is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or
schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost.

2\. Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is
unable to complete a project because his or her own overly strict
standards are not met).

3\. Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of
leisure activities and friendships (not accounted for by obvious
economic necessity).

4\. Is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of
morality, ethics, or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious
identification).

5\. Is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they
have no sentimental value.

6\. Is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they
submit to exactly his or her way of doing things.

7\. Adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money
is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes.

8\. Shows rigidity and stubbornness.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a
preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and
interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and
efficiency. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a
variety of contexts.

Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder attempt to
maintain a sense of control through painstaking attention to rules,
trivial details, procedures, lists, schedules, or form to the extent
that the major point of the activity is lost (Criterion 1). They are
excessively careful and prone to repetition, paying extraordinary
attention to detail and repeatedly checking for possible mistakes. They
are oblivious to the fact that other people tend to become very annoyed
at the delays and inconveniences that result from this behavior. For
example, when such individuals misplace a list of things to be done,
they will spend an inordinate amount of time looking for the list rather
than spending a few moments recreating it from memory and proceeding to
accomplish the tasks. Time is poorly allocated, and the most important
tasks are left to the last moment. The perfectionism and self-imposed
high standards of performance cause significant dysfunction and distress
in these individuals. They may become so involved in making every detail
of a project absolutely perfect that the project is never finished
(Criterion 2). For example, the completion of a written report is
delayed by numerous time-consuming rewrites that all come up short of
"perfection." Deadlines are missed, and aspects of the individual's life
that are not the current focus of activity may fall into disarray.

Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder display
excessive devotion to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure
activities and friendships (Criterion 3).

This behavior is not accounted for by economic necessity. They often
feel that they do not have time to take an evening or a weekend day off
to go on an outing or to just relax. They may keep postponing a
pleasurable activity, such as a vacation, so that it may never occur.

When they do take time for leisure activities or vacations, they are
very uncomfortable unless they have taken along something to work on so
they do not "waste time." There may be a great concentration on
household chores (e.g., repeated excessive cleaning so that "one could
eat off the floor"). If they spend time with friends, it is likely to be
in some kind of formally organized activity (e.g., sports). Hobbies or
recreational activities are approached as serious tasks requiring
careful organization and hard work to master. The emphasis is on perfect
performance. These individuals turn play into a structured task (e.g.,
correcting an infant for not putting rings on the post in the right
order; telling a toddler to ride his or her tri-cycle in a straight
line; turning a baseball game into a harsh "lesson").

Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may be
excessively conscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of
morality, ethics, or values (Criterion 4). They may force themselves and
others to follow rigid moral principles and very strict standards of
performance. They may also be mercilessly self-critical about their own
mistakes. Individuals with this disorder are rigidly deferential to
authority and rules and insist on quite literal compliance, with no rule
bending for extenuating circumstances. For example, the individual will
not lend a quarter to a friend who needs one to make a telephone call
because "neither a borrower nor a lender be" or because it would be
"bad" for []{#index_split_073.html#p725}**680**

Personality Disorders

the person's character. These qualities should not be accounted for by
the individual's cultural or religious identification.

Individuals with this disorder may be unable to discard worn-out or
worthless objects, even when they have no sentimental value (Criterion
5). Often these individuals will admit to being "pack rats." They regard
discarding objects as wasteful because "you never know when you might
need something" and will become upset if someone tries to get rid of the
things they have saved. Their spouses or roommates may complain about
the amount of space taken up by old parts, magazines, broken appliances,
and so on.

Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are reluctant
to delegate tasks or to work with others (Criterion 6). They stubbornly
and unreasonably insist that everything be done their way and that
people conform to their way of doing things. They often give very
detailed instructions about how things should be done (e.g., there is
one and only one way to mow the lawn, wash the dishes, build a doghouse)
and are surprised and irritated if others suggest creative alternatives.
At other times they may reject offers of help even when behind schedule
because they believe no one else can do it right.

Individuals with this disorder may be miserly and stingy and maintain a
standard of living far below what they can afford, believing that
spending must be tightly controlled to provide for future catastrophes
(Criterion 7). Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is
characterized by rigidity and stubbornness (Criterion 8). Individuals
with this disorder are so concerned about having things done the one
"correct" way that they have trouble going along with anyone else's
ideas. These individuals plan ahead in meticulous detail and are
unwilling to consider changes. Totally wrapped up in their own
perspective, they have difficulty acknowledging the viewpoints of
others. Friends and colleagues may become frustrated by this constant
rigidity. Even when individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder recognize that it may be in their interest to compromise, they
may stubbornly refuse to do so, arguing that it is "the principle of the
thing."

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

When rules and established procedures do not dictate the correct answer,
decision making may become a time-consuming, often painful process.
Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may have such
difficulty deciding which tasks take priority or what is the best way of
doing some particular task that they may never get started on anything.
They are prone to become upset or angry in situations in which they are
not able to maintain control of their physical or interpersonal
environment, although the anger is typically not expressed directly. For
example, an individual may be angry when service in a restaurant is
poor, but instead of complaining to the management, the individual
ruminates about how much to leave as a tip. On other occasions, anger
may be expressed with righteous indignation over a seemingly minor
matter. Individuals with this disorder may be especially attentive to
their relative status in dominance-submission relationships and may
display excessive deference to an authority they respect and excessive
resistance to authority they do not respect.

Individuals with this disorder usually express affection in a highly
controlled or stilted fashion and may be very uncomfortable in the
presence of others who are emotionally expressive. Their everyday
relationships have a formal and serious quality, and they may be stiff
in situations in which others would smile and be happy (e.g., greeting a
lover at the airport). They carefully hold themselves back until they
are sure that whatever they say will be perfect. They may be preoccupied
with logic and intellect, and intolerant of affective behavior in
others. They often have difficulty expressing tender feelings, rarely
paying compliments. Individuals with this disorder may experience
occupational difficulties and distress, particularly when confronted
with new situations that demand flexibility and compromise.

Individuals with anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety
disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and specific phobias,
and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)

[]{#index_split_073.html#p726}Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder
**681**

have an increased likelihood of having a personality disturbance that
meets criteria for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Even so,
it appears that the majority of individuals with OCD do not have a
pattern of behavior that meets criteria for this personality disorder.
Many of the features of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
overlap with

"type A" personality characteristics (e.g., preoccupation with work,
competitiveness, time urgency), and these features may be present in
people at risk for myocardial infarction.

There may be an association between obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder and depressive and bipolar disorders and eating disorders.

Prevalence

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is one of the most prevalent
personality disorders in the general population, with estimated
prevalence ranging from 2.1% to 7.9%.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

In assessing an individual for obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, the clinician should not include those behaviors that reflect
habits, customs, or interpersonal styles that are culturally sanctioned
by the individual's reference group. Certain cultures place substantial
emphasis on work and productivity; the resulting behaviors in members of
those societies need not be considered indications of
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

In systematic studies, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder appears
to be diagnosed about twice as often among males.

Differential Diagnosis

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Despite the similarity in names, OCD is usually easily distinguished
from obsessive-compulsive personality disorder by the presence of true
obsessions and compulsions in OCD. When criteria for both
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and OCD are met, both
diagnoses should be recorded.

Hoarding disorder.

A diagnosis of hoarding disorder should be considered especially when
hoarding is extreme (e.g., accumulated stacks of worthless objects
present a fire hazard and make it difficult for others to walk through
the house). When criteria for both obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder and hoarding disorder are met, both diagnoses should be
recorded.

Other personality disorders and personality traits.

Other personality disorders may

be confused with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder because they
have certain features in common. It is, therefore, important to
distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their
characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in
addition to obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, all can be
diagnosed. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may also
profess a commitment to perfectionism and believe that others cannot do
things as well, but these individuals are more likely to believe that
they have achieved perfection, whereas those with obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder are usually self-critical. Individuals with
narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder lack generosity but will
indulge themselves, whereas those with obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder adopt a miserly spending style toward both self and others.
Both schizoid personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder may be characterized by an apparent formality and social
detachment. In obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, this stems
from discomfort with emotions and excessive devotion to work, whereas in
schizoid personality disorder there is a fundamental lack of capacity
for intimacy.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p727}**682**

Personality Disorders

Obsessive-compulsive personality traits in moderation may be especially
adaptive, particularly in situations that reward high performance. Only
when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause
significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they
constitute obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.

Personality change due to another medical condition.

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder must be distinguished from
personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits
emerge attributable to the effects of another medical condition on the
central nervous system.

Substance use disorders.

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder must also be distinguished
from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance
use.

**Other Personality Disorders**

Personality Change

Due to Another Medical Condition

Diagnostic Criteria

**310.1 (F07.0)**

A. A persistent personality disturbance that represents a change from
the individual's previous characteristic personality pattern.

**Note:** In children, the disturbance involves a marked deviation from
normal development or a significant change in the child's usual behavior
patterns, lasting at least 1 year.

B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct
pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.

C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder
(including another mental disorder due to another medical condition).

D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
delirium.

E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

*Specify* whether:

**Labile type:** If the predominant feature is affective lability.

**Disinhibited type:** If the predominant feature is poor impulse
control as evidenced by sexual indiscretions, *etc.*

**Aggressive type:** If the predominant feature is aggressive behavior.

**Apathetic type:** If the predominant feature is marked apathy and
indifference.

**Paranoid type:** If the predominant feature is suspiciousness or
paranoid ideation.

**Other type:** If the presentation is not characterized by any of the
above subtypes.

**Combined type:** If more than one feature predominates in the clinical
picture.

**Unspecified type**

**Coding note:** Include the name of the other medical condition (e.g.,
310.1 \[F07.0\] personality change due to temporal lobe epilepsy). The
other medical condition should be coded and listed separately
immediately before the personality disorder due to another medical
condition (e.g., 345.40 \[G40.209\] temporal lobe epilepsy; 310.1
\[F07.0\] personality change due to temporal lobe epilepsy).

[]{#index_split_073.html#p728}Personality Change Due to Another Medical
Condition **683**

Subtypes

The particular personality change can be specified by indicating the
symptom presentation that predominates in the clinical presentation.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of a personality change due to another medical
condition is a persistent personality disturbance that is judged to be
due to the direct pathophysiological effects of a medical condition. The
personality disturbance represents a change from the individual's
previous characteristic personality pattern. In children, this condition
may be manifested as a marked deviation from normal development rather
than as a change in a stable personality pattern (Criterion A). There
must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory
findings that the personality change is the direct physiological
consequence of another medical condition (Criterion B). The diagnosis is
not given if the disturbance is better explained by another mental
disorder (Criterion C). The diagnosis is not given if the disturbance
occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The
disturbance must also cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning (Criterion E).

Common manifestations of the personality change include affective
instability, poor impulse control, outbursts of aggression or rage
grossly out of proportion to any precipitating psychosocial stressor,
marked apathy, suspiciousness, or paranoid ideation. The phenomenology
of the change is indicated using the subtypes listed in the criteria
set. An individual with the disorder is often characterized by others as
"not himself \[or herself\]."

Although it shares the term "personality" with the other personality
disorders, this diagnosis is distinct by virtue of its specific
etiology, different phenomenology, and more variable onset and course.

The clinical presentation in a given individual may depend on the nature
and localiza-tion of the pathological process. For example, injury to
the frontal lobes may yield symptoms such as lack of judgment or
foresight, facetiousness, disinhibition, and euphoria.

Right hemisphere strokes have often been shown to evoke personality
changes in association with unilateral spatial neglect, anosognosia
(i.e., inability of the individual to recognize a bodily or functional
deficit, such as the existence of hemiparesis), motor im-persistence,
and other neurological deficits.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A variety of neurological and other medical conditions may cause
personality changes, including central nervous system neoplasms, head
trauma, cerebrovascular disease, Huntington's disease, epilepsy,
infectious conditions with central nervous system involvement (e.g.,
HIV), endocrine conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypo-and
hyperadre-nocorticism), and autoimmune conditions with central nervous
system involvement (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus). The associated
physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and patterns of
prevalence and onset reflect those of the neurological or other medical
condition involved.

Differential Diagnosis

Chronic medical conditions associated with pain and disability.

Chronic medical conditions associated with pain and disability can also
be associated with changes in personality. The diagnosis of personality
change due to another medical condition is given only if a direct
pathophysiological mechanism can be established. This diagnosis is not
given if the change is due to a behavioral or psychological adjustment
or response to another medical condition (e.g., dependent behaviors that
result from a need for the assistance of others following a severe head
trauma, cardiovascular disease, or dementia).

[]{#index_split_073.html#p729}**684**

Personality Disorders

Delirium or major neurocognitive disorder.

Personality change is a frequently associated

feature of a delirium or major neurocognitive disorder. A separate
diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition is not
given if the change occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium.
However, the diagnosis of personality change due to another medical
condition may be given in addition to the diagnosis of major
neurocognitive disorder if the personality change is a prominent part of
the clinical presentation.

Another mental disorder due to another medical condition.

The diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition is
not given if the disturbance is better explained by another mental
disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., depressive disorder due
to brain tumor).

Substance use disorders.

Personality changes may also occur in the context of substance use
disorders, especially if the disorder is long-standing. The clinician
should inquire carefully about the nature and extent of substance use.
If the clinician wishes to indicate an etiological relationship between
the personality change and substance use, the unspecified category for
the specific substance (e.g., unspecified stimulant-related disorder)
can be used.

Other mental disorders.

Marked personality changes may also be an associated feature of other
mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia; delusional disorder; depressive
and bipolar disorders; other specified and unspecified disruptive
behavior, impulse-control, and conduct disorders; panic disorder).
However, in these disorders, no specific physiological factor is judged
to be etiologically related to the personality change.

Other personality disorders.

Personality change due to another medical condition can be distinguished
from a personality disorder by the requirement for a clinically
significant change from baseline personality functioning and the
presence of a specific etiological medical condition.

Other Specified Personality Disorder

**301.89 (F60.89)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a personality disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the personality disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified personality disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific personality
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified personality
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "mixed personality
features").

Unspecified Personality Disorder

**301.9 (F60.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a personality disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the personality disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
personality disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses *not* to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific personality disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p730}**Paraphilic**

**Disorders**

Paraphilic disorders included in this manual are voyeuristic disorder
(spying on others in private activities), exhibitionistic disorder
(exposing the genitals), frotteuristic disorder (touching or rubbing
against a nonconsenting individual), sexual masochism disorder
(undergoing humiliation, bondage, or suffering), sexual sadism disorder
(inflicting humiliation, bondage, or suffering), pedophilic disorder
(sexual focus on children), fetishistic disorder (using nonliving
objects or having a highly specific focus on nongenital body parts), and
transvestic disorder (engaging in sexually arousing cross-dressing).

These disorders have traditionally been selected for specific listing
and assignment of explicit diagnostic criteria in DSM for two main
reasons: they are relatively common, in relation to other paraphilic
disorders, and some of them entail actions for their satisfaction that,
because of their noxiousness or potential harm to others, are classed as
criminal offenses. The eight listed disorders do not exhaust the list of
possible paraphilic disorders.

Many dozens of distinct paraphilias have been identified and named, and
almost any of them could, by virtue of its negative consequences for the
individual or for others, rise to the level of a paraphilic disorder.
The diagnoses of the other specified and unspecified paraphilic
disorders are therefore indispensable and will be required in many
cases.

In this chapter, the order of presentation of the listed paraphilic
disorders generally corresponds to common classification schemes for
these conditions. The first group of disorders is based on *anomalous
activity preferences.* These disorders are subdivided into *courtship
disorders,* which resemble distorted components of human courtship
behavior (voyeuristic disorder, exhibitionistic disorder, and
frotteuristic disorder), and *algolagnic* *disorders,* which involve
pain and suffering (sexual masochism disorder and sexual sadism
disorder). The second group of disorders is based on *anomalous target
preferences.* These disorders include one directed at other humans
(pedophilic disorder) and two directed elsewhere (fetishistic disorder
and transvestic disorder).

The term *paraphilia* denotes any intense and persistent sexual interest
other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory
fondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human
partners. In some circumstances, the criteria "intense and persistent"
may be difficult to apply, such as in the assessment of persons who are
very old or medically ill and who may not have "intense" sexual
interests of any kind. In such circumstances, the term *paraphilia* may
be defined as any sexual interest greater than or equal to normophilic
sexual interests. There are also specific paraphilias that are generally
better described as *preferential* sexual interests than as intense
sexual interests.

Some paraphilias primarily concern the individual's erotic activities,
and others primarily concern the individual's erotic targets. Examples
of the former would include intense and persistent interests in
spanking, whipping, cutting, binding, or strangulating another person,
or an interest in these activities that equals or exceeds the
individual's interest in copulation or equivalent interaction with
another person. Examples of the latter would include intense or
preferential sexual interest in children, corpses, or amputees (as a
class), as well as intense or preferential interest in nonhuman animals,
such as horses or dogs, or in inanimate objects, such as shoes or
articles made of rubber.

A *paraphilic disorder* is a paraphilia that is currently causing
distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose
satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, to **685**

[]{#index_split_073.html#p731}**686**

Paraphilic Disorders

others. A paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for
having a paraphilic disorder, and a paraphilia by itself does not
necessarily justify or require clinical intervention.

In the diagnostic criteria set for each of the listed paraphilic
disorders, Criterion A specifies the qualitative nature of the
paraphilia (e.g., an erotic focus on children or on exposing the
genitals to strangers), and Criterion B specifies the negative
consequences of the paraphilia (i.e., distress, impairment, or harm to
others). In keeping with the distinction between paraphilias and
paraphilic disorders, the term *diagnosis* should be reserved for
individuals who meet both Criteria A and B (i.e., individuals who have a
paraphilic disorder). If an individual meets Criterion A but not
Criterion B for a particular paraphilia---a circumstance that might
arise when a benign paraphilia is discovered during the clinical
investigation of some other condition--- then the individual may be said
to have that paraphilia but not a paraphilic disorder.

It is not rare for an individual to manifest two or more paraphilias. In
some cases, the paraphilic foci are closely related and the connection
between the paraphilias is intuitively comprehensible (e.g., foot
fetishism and shoe fetishism). In other cases, the connection between
the paraphilias is not obvious, and the presence of multiple paraphilias
may be coincidental or else related to some generalized vulnerability to
anomalies of psychosexual development. In any event, comorbid diagnoses
of separate paraphilic disorders may be warranted if more than one
paraphilia is causing suffering to the individual or harm to others.

Because of the two-pronged nature of diagnosing paraphilic disorders,
clinician-rated or self-rated measures and severity assessments could
address either the strength of the paraphilia itself or the seriousness
of its consequences. Although the distress and impairment stipulated in
the Criterion B are special in being the immediate or ultimate result of
the paraphilia and not primarily the result of some other factor, the
phenomena of reactive depression, anxiety, guilt, poor work history,
impaired social relations, and so on are not unique in themselves and
may be quantified with multipurpose measures of psychosocial functioning
or quality of life.

The most widely applicable framework for assessing the strength of a
paraphilia itself is one in which examinees' paraphilic sexual
fantasies, urges, or behaviors are evaluated in relation to their
normophilic sexual interests and behaviors. In a clinical interview or
on self-administered questionnaires, examinees can be asked whether
their paraphilic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors are weaker than,
approximately equal to, or stronger than their normophilic sexual
interests and behaviors. This same type of comparison can be, and
usually is, employed in psychophysiological measures of sexual interest,
such as penile plethysmography in males or viewing time in males and
females.

Voyeuristic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.82 (F65.3)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the
process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity, as manifested by
fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting
person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

C. The individual experiencing the arousal and/or acting on the urges is
at least 18 years of age.

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable
to individuals living in institutional or other settings where
opportunities to engage in voyeuristic behavior are restricted.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p732}Voyeuristic Disorder

**687**

**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a
nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5
years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Specifiers

The "in full remission" specifier does not address the continued
presence or absence of voyeurism per se, which may still be present
after behaviors and distress have remitted.

Diagnostic Features

The diagnostic criteria for voyeuristic disorder can apply both to
individuals who more or less freely disclose this paraphilic interest
and to those who categorically deny any sexual arousal from observing an
unsuspecting person who is naked, disrobing, or engaged in sexual
activity despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. If
disclosing individuals also report distress or psychosocial problems
because of their voyeuristic sexual preferences, they could be diagnosed
with voyeuristic disorder. On the other hand, if they declare no
distress, demonstrated by lack of anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame,
about these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in other important
areas of functioning because of this sexual interest, and their
psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act on it, they
could be ascertained as having voyeuristic sexual interest but should
*not* be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder.

Nondisclosing individuals include, for example, individuals known to
have been spying repeatedly on unsuspecting persons who are naked or
engaging in sexual activity on separate occasions but who deny any urges
or fantasies concerning such sexual behavior, and who may report that
known episodes of watching unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons
were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of
observing unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons but contest any
significant or sustained sexual interest in this behavior. Since these
individuals deny having fantasies or impulses about watching others nude
or involved in sexual activity, it follows that they would also reject
feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses.
Despite their nondisclosing stance, such individuals may be diagnosed
with voyeuristic disorder. Recurrent voyeuristic behavior constitutes
sufficient support for voyeurism (by fulfilling Criterion A) and
simultaneously demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated behavior
is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion B).

"Recurrent" spying on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in
sexual activity (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion)
may, as a general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on
separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this
criterion if there were multiple occasions of watching the same victim
or if there is corroborating evidence of a distinct or preferential
interest in secret watching of naked or sexually active unsuspecting
persons. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a
sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis; the criteria may
also be met if the individual acknowledges intense voyeuristic sexual
interest.

The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of
voyeurism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be
understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure
that the sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting naked or
sexually active others is not merely transient.

Adolescence and puberty generally increase sexual curiosity and
activity. To alleviate the risk of pathologizing normative sexual
interest and behavior during pubertal adolescence, the minimum age for
the diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years (Criterion C).

Prevalence

Voyeuristic acts are the most common of potentially law-breaking sexual
behaviors. The population prevalence of voyeuristic disorder is unknown.
However, based on voyeuris-

[]{#index_split_073.html#p733}**688**

Paraphilic Disorders

tic sexual acts in nonclinical samples, the highest possible lifetime
prevalence for voyeuristic disorder is approximately 12% in males and 4%
in females.

Development and Course

Adult males with voyeuristic disorder often first become aware of their
sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting persons during
adolescence. However, the minimum age for a diagnosis of voyeuristic
disorder is 18 years because there is substantial difficulty in
differentiating it from age-appropriate puberty-related sexual curiosity
and activity. The persistence of voyeurism over time is unclear.
Voyeuristic disorder, however, per definition requires one or more
contributing factors that may change over time with or without
treatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual
frustration, loneliness), psychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality, and
sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity to
act out sexually by spying on unsuspecting naked or sexually active
persons. Therefore, the course of voyeuristic disorder is likely to vary
with age.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Voyeurism is a necessary precondition for voyeuristic disorder; hence,
risk factors for voyeurism should also increase the rate of voyeuristic
disorder.

Environmental.

Childhood sexual abuse, substance misuse, and sexual preoccupation/

hypersexuality have been suggested as risk factors, although the causal
relationship to voyeurism is uncertain and the specificity unclear.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Voyeuristic disorder is very uncommon among females in clinical
settings, while the male-to-female ratio for single sexually arousing
voyeuristic acts might be 3:1.

Differential Diagnosis

Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.

Conduct disorder in adolescents

and antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional
norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest
in secretly watching unsuspecting others who are naked or engaging in
sexual activity should be lacking.

Substance use disorders.

Substance use disorders might involve single voyeuristic episodes by
intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sexual
interest in secretly watching unsuspecting persons being naked or
engaging in sexual activity. Hence, recurrent voyeuristic sexual
fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is
not intoxicated suggest that voyeuristic disorder might be present.

Comorbidity

Known comorbidities in voyeuristic disorder are largely based on
research with males suspected of or convicted for acts involving the
secret watching of unsuspecting nude or sexually active persons. Hence,
these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals with voyeuristic
disorder. Conditions that occur comorbidly with voyeuristic disorder
include hypersexuality and other paraphilic disorders, particularly
exhibitionistic disorder. Depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and substance
use disorders; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and conduct
disorder and antisocial personality disorder are also frequent comorbid
conditions.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p734}Exhibitionistic Disorder

**689**

Exhibitionistic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.4 (F65.2)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
arousal from the exposure of one's genitals to an unsuspecting person,
as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting
person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

*Specify* whether:

**Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children**
**Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to physically mature
individuals** **Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal
children and to physically** **mature individuals**

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable
to individuals living in institutional or other settings where
opportunities to expose one's genitals are restricted.

**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a
nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5
years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Subtypes

The subtypes for exhibitionistic disorder are based on the age or
physical maturity of the nonconsenting individuals to whom the
individual prefers to expose his or her genitals. The nonconsenting
individuals could be prepubescent children, adults, or both. This
specifier should help draw adequate attention to characteristics of
victims of individuals with exhibitionistic disorder to prevent
co-occurring pedophilic disorder from being overlooked. However,
indications that the individual with exhibitionistic disorder is
sexually attracted to exposing his or her genitals to children should
not preclude a diagnosis of pedophilic disorder.

Specifiers

The "in full remission" specifier does not address the continued
presence or absence of exhibitionism per se, which may still be present
after behaviors and distress have remitted.

Diagnostic Features

The diagnostic criteria for exhibitionistic disorder can apply both to
individuals who more or less freely disclose this paraphilia and to
those who categorically deny any sexual attraction to exposing their
genitals to unsuspecting persons despite substantial objective evidence
to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report psychosocial
difficulties because of their sexual attractions or preferences for
exposing, they may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder. In
contrast, if they declare no distress (exemplified by absence of
anxiety, obsessions, and guilt or shame about these paraphilic impulses)
and are not impaired by this sexual interest in other important areas of
functioning, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories
indicate that they do not act on them, they could be ascertained as
having exhibitionistic sexual interest but *not* be diagnosed with
exhibitionistic disorder.

Examples of nondisclosing individuals include those who have exposed
themselves repeatedly to unsuspecting persons on separate occasions but
who deny any urges or fan-

[]{#index_split_073.html#p735}**690**

Paraphilic Disorders

tasies about such sexual behavior and who report that known episodes of
exposure were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past
episodes of sexual behavior involving genital exposure but refute any
significant or sustained sexual interest in such behavior. Since these
individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving genital exposure,
it follows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or
socially impaired by such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed
with exhibitionistic disorder despite their negative self-report.
Recurrent exhibitionistic behavior constitutes sufficient support for
exhibitionism (Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that this
paraphilically motivated behavior is causing harm to others (Criterion
B).

"Recurrent" genital exposure to unsuspecting others (i.e., multiple
victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be
interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer
victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there were
multiple occasions of exposure to the same victim, or if there is
corroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in genital
exposure to unsuspecting persons. Note that multiple victims, as
suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for
diagnosis, as criteria may be met by an individual's acknowledging
intense exhibitionistic sexual interest with distress and/or impairment.

The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of
exhibitionism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be
understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure
that the sexual interest in exposing one's genitals to unsuspecting
others is not merely transient. This might be expressed in clear
evidence of repeated behaviors or distress over a nontransient period
shorter than 6 months.

Prevalence

The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder is unknown. However, based on
exhibitionistic sexual acts in nonclinical or general populations, the
highest possible prevalence for exhibitionistic disorder in the male
population is 2%--4%. The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder in
females is even more uncertain but is generally believed to be much
lower than in males.

Development and Course

Adult males with exhibitionistic disorder often report that they first
became aware of sexual interest in exposing their genitals to
unsuspecting persons during adolescence, at a somewhat later time than
the typical development of normative sexual interest in women or men.
Although there is no minimum age requirement for the diagnosis of
exhibitionistic disorder, it may be difficult to differentiate
exhibitionistic behaviors from age-appropriate sexual curiosity in
adolescents. Whereas exhibitionistic impulses appear to emerge in
adolescence or early adulthood, very little is known about persistence
over time. By definition, exhibitionistic disorder requires one or more
contributing factors, which may change over time with or without
treatment; subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual
frustration, loneliness), mental disorder comorbidity, hypersexuality,
and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity
to act out sexually by exposing the genitals to unsuspecting persons.
Therefore, the course of exhibitionistic disorder is likely to vary with
age. As with other sexual preferences, advancing age may be associated
with decreasing exhibitionistic sexual preferences and behavior.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Since exhibitionism is a necessary precondition for exhibitionistic
disorder, risk factors for exhibitionism should also increase the rate
of exhibitionistic disorder. Antisocial history, antisocial personality
disorder, alcohol misuse, and pedophilic sexual preference might
increase risk of sexual recidivism in exhibitionistic offenders.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p736}Frotteuristic Disorder

**691**

Hence, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol use disorder, and
pedophilic interest may be considered risk factors for exhibitionistic
disorder in males with exhibitionistic sexual preferences.

Environmental.

Childhood sexual and emotional abuse and sexual
preoccupation/hypersexuality have been suggested as risk factors for
exhibitionism, although the causal relationship to exhibitionism is
uncertain and the specificity unclear.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Exhibitionistic disorder is highly unusual in females, whereas single
sexually arousing exhibitionistic acts might occur up to half as often
among women compared with men.

Functional Consequences of Exhibitionistic Disorder

The functional consequences of exhibitionistic disorder have not been
addressed in research involving individuals who have not acted out
sexually by exposing their genitals to unsuspecting strangers but who
fulfill Criterion B by experiencing intense emotional distress over
these preferences.

Differential Diagnosis

Potential differential diagnoses for exhibitionistic disorder sometimes
occur also as comorbid disorders. Therefore, it is generally necessary
to evaluate the evidence for exhibitionistic disorder and other possible
conditions as separate questions.

Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.

Conduct disorder in adolescents

and antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional
norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest
in exposing the genitals should be lacking.

Substance use disorders.

Alcohol and substance use disorders might involve single exhibitionistic
episodes by intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical
sexual interest in exposing the genitals to unsuspecting persons. Hence,
recurrent exhibitionistic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that
occur also when the individual is not intoxicated suggest that
exhibitionistic disorder might be present.

Comorbidity

Known comorbidities in exhibitionistic disorder are largely based on
research with individuals (almost all males) convicted for criminal acts
involving genital exposure to nonconsenting individuals. Hence, these
comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who qualify for a
diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder. Conditions that occur comorbidly
with exhibitionistic disorder at high rates include depressive, bipolar,
anxiety, and substance use disorders; hypersexuality;
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; other paraphilic disorders;
and antisocial personality disorder.

Frotteuristic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.89 (F65.81)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
arousal from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as
manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting
person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p737}**692**

Paraphilic Disorders

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable
to individuals living in institutional or other settings where
opportunities to touch or rub against a nonconsenting person are
restricted.

**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a
nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5
years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Specifiers

The "in remission" specifier does not address the continued presence or
absence of frotteurism per se, which may still be present after
behaviors and distress have remitted.

Diagnostic Features

The diagnostic criteria for frotteuristic disorder can apply both to
individuals who relatively freely disclose this paraphilia and to those
who firmly deny any sexual attraction from touching or rubbing against a
nonconsenting individual regardless of considerable objective evidence
to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report psychosocial
impairment due to their sexual preferences for touching or rubbing
against a nonconsenting individual, they could be diagnosed with
frotteuristic disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress
(demonstrated by lack of anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame) about
these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in other important areas
of functioning because of this sexual interest, and their psychiatric or
legal histories indicate that they do not act on it, they could be
ascertained as having frotteuristic sexual interest but should *not* be
diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder.

Nondisclosing individuals include, for instance, individuals known to
have been touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals on
separate occasions but who contest any urges or fantasies concerning
such sexual behavior. Such individuals may report that identified
episodes of touching or rubbing against an unwilling individual were all
unintentional and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of
touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals but contest any
major or persistent sexual interest in this. Since these individuals
deny having fantasies or impulses about touching or rubbing, they would
consequently reject feeling distressed or psychosocially impaired by
such impulses. Despite their nondisclosing position, such individuals
may be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. *Recurrent* frotteuristic
behavior constitutes satisfactory support for frotteurism (by fulfilling
Criterion A) and concurrently demonstrates that this paraphilically
motivated behavior is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion
B).

"Recurrent" touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual
(i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general
rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions.
Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there
were multiple occasions of touching or rubbing against the same
unwilling individual, or corroborating evidence of a strong or
preferential interest in touching or rubbing against nonconsenting
individuals. Note that multiple victims are a sufficient but not a
necessary condition for diagnosis; criteria may also be met if the
individual acknowledges intense frotteuristic sexual interest with
clinically significant distress and/or impairment.

The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of
frotteurism must persist for at least 6 months, should also be
interpreted as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure
that the sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting
individual is not transient. Hence, the duration part of Criterion A may
also be met if there is clear evidence of recurrent behaviors or
distress over a shorter but nontransient time period.

Prevalence

Frotteuristic acts, including the uninvited sexual touching of or
rubbing against another individual, may occur in up to 30% of adult
males in the general population. Approximately

[]{#index_split_073.html#p738}Frotteuristic Disorder

**693**

10%--14% of adult males seen in outpatient settings for paraphilic
disorders and hypersexuality have a presentation that meets diagnostic
criteria for frotteuristic disorder. Hence, whereas the population
prevalence of frotteuristic *disorder* is unknown, it is not likely that
it exceeds the rate found in selected clinical settings.

Development and Course

Adult males with frotteuristic disorder often report first becoming
aware of their sexual interest in surreptitiously touching unsuspecting
persons during late adolescence or emerging adulthood. However, children
and adolescents may also touch or rub against unwilling others in the
absence of a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder. Although there is no
minimum age for the diagnosis, frotteuristic disorder can be difficult
to differentiate from conduct-disordered behavior without sexual
motivation in individuals at younger ages. The persistence of
frotteurism over time is unclear. Frotteuristic disorder, however, by
definition requires one or more contributing factors that may change
over time with or without treatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt,
shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness); psychiatric morbidity;
hypersexuality and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or
the propensity to act out sexually by touching or rubbing against
unconsenting persons. Therefore, the course of frotteuristic disorder is
likely to vary with age. As with other sexual preferences, advancing age
may be associated with decreasing frotteuristic sexual preferences and
behavior.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Nonsexual antisocial behavior and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality
might be nonspecific risk factors, although the causal relationship to
frotteurism is uncertain and the specificity unclear. However,
frotteurism is a necessary precondition for frotteuristic disorder, so
risk factors for frotteurism should also increase the rate of
frotteuristic disorder.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

There appear to be substantially fewer females with frotteuristic sexual
preferences than males.

Differential Diagnosis

Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.

Conduct disorder in adolescents

and antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional
norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest
in touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual should be
lacking.

Substance use disorders.

Substance use disorders, particularly those involving stimulants such as
cocaine and amphetamines, might involve single frotteuristic episodes by
intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sustained
sexual interest in touching or rubbing against unsuspecting persons.
Hence, recurrent frotteuristic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors
that occur also when the individual is not intoxicated suggest that
frotteuristic disorder might be present.

Comorbidity

Known comorbidities in frotteuristic disorder are largely based on
research with males suspected of or convicted for criminal acts
involving sexually motivated touching of or rubbing against a
nonconsenting individual. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to
other individuals with a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder based on
subjective distress over their sexual interest. Conditions that occur
comorbidly with frotteuristic disorder include hypersexuality and other
paraphilic disorders, particularly exhibitionistic disorder and
voyeuristic disorder. Conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder,
depressive []{#index_split_073.html#p739}**694**

Paraphilic Disorders

disorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use
disorders also co-occur.

Potential differential diagnoses for frotteuristic disorder sometimes
occur also as comorbid disorders. Therefore, it is generally necessary
to evaluate the evidence for frotteuristic disorder and possible
comorbid conditions as separate questions.

Sexual Masochism Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.83 (F65.51)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise
made to suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning.

*Specify* if:

**With asphyxiophilia:** If the individual engages in the practice of
achieving sexual arousal related to restriction of breathing.

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable
to individuals living in institutional or other settings where
opportunities to engage in masochistic sexual behaviors are restricted.

**In full remission:** There has been no distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at last 5 years
while in an uncontrolled environment.

Diagnostic Features

The diagnostic criteria for sexual masochism disorder are intended to
apply to individuals who freely admit to having such paraphilic
interests. Such individuals openly acknowledge intense sexual arousal
from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to
suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. If these
individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their
sexual attractions or preferences for being humiliated, beaten, bound,
or otherwise made to suffer, they may be diagnosed with sexual masochism
disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress, exemplified by
anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses,
and are not hampered by them in pursuing other personal goals, they
could be ascertained as having masochistic sexual interest but should
*not* be diagnosed with sexual masochism disorder.

The Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of
sexual masochism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should be
understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure
that the sexual interest in being humiliated, beaten, bound, or
otherwise made to suffer is not merely transient. However, the disorder
can be diagnosed in the context of a clearly sustained but shorter time
period.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The extensive use of pornography involving the act of being humiliated,
beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer is sometimes an associated
feature of sexual masochism disorder.

Prevalence

The population prevalence of sexual masochism disorder is unknown. In
Australia, it has been estimated that 2.2% of males and 1.3% of females
had been involved in bondage and discipline, sadomasochism, or dominance
and submission in the past 12 months.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p740}Sexual Sadism Disorder

**695**

Development and Course

Community individuals with paraphilias have reported a mean age at onset
for masochism of 19.3 years, although earlier ages, including puberty
and childhood, have also been reported for the onset of masochistic
fantasies. Very little is known about persistence over time. Sexual
masochism disorder per definition requires one or more contributing
factors, which may change over time with or without treatment. These
include subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual
frustration, loneliness), psychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality and
sexual impulsivity, and psychosocial impairment. Therefore, the course
of sexual masochism disorder is likely to vary with age. Advancing age
is likely to have the same reducing effect on sexual preference
involving sexual masochism as it has on other paraphilic or normophilic
sexual behavior.

Functional Consequences of Sexual Masochism Disorder

The functional consequences of sexual masochism disorder are unknown.
However, masochists are at risk of accidental death while practicing
asphyxiophilia or other autoerotic procedures.

Differential Diagnosis

Many of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for sexual
masochism disorder (e.g., transvestic fetishism, sexual sadism disorder,
hypersexuality, alcohol and substance use disorders) sometimes occur
also as comorbid diagnoses. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully
evaluate the evidence for sexual masochism disorder, keeping the
possibility of other paraphilias or other mental disorders as part of
the differential diagnosis. Sexual masochism in the absence of distress
(i.e., no disorder) is also included in the differential, as individuals
who conduct the behaviors may be satisfied with their masochistic
interest.

Comorbidity

Known comorbidities with sexual masochism disorder are largely based on
individuals in treatment. Disorders that occur comorbidly with sexual
masochism disorder typically include other paraphilic disorders, such as
transvestic fetishism.

Sexual Sadism Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.84 (F65.52)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
arousal from the physical or psychological suffering of another person,
as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting
person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning.

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable
to individuals living in institutional or other settings where
opportunities to engage in sadistic sexual behaviors are restricted.

**In full remission:** The individual has not acted on the urges with a
nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5
years while in an uncontrolled environment.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p741}**696**

Paraphilic Disorders

Diagnostic Features

The diagnostic criteria for sexual sadism disorder are intended to apply
both to individuals who freely admit to having such paraphilic interests
and to those who deny any sexual interest in the physical or
psychological suffering of another individual despite substantial
objective evidence to the contrary. Individuals who openly acknowledge
intense sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of
others are referred to as "admitting individuals." If these individuals
also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual
attractions or preferences for the physical or psychological suffering
of another individual, they may be diagnosed with sexual sadism
disorder. In contrast, if admitting individuals declare no distress,
exemplified by anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these
paraphilic impulses, and are not hampered by them in pursuing other
goals, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories indicate
that they do not act on them, then they could be ascertained as having
sadistic sexual interest but they would *not* meet criteria for sexual
sadism disorder.

Examples of individuals who deny any interest in the physical or
psychological suffering of another individual include individuals known
to have inflicted pain or suffering on multiple victims on separate
occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies about such sexual behavior
and who may further claim that known episodes of sexual assault were
either unintentional or nonsexual. Others may admit past episodes of
sexual behavior involving the infliction of pain or suffering on a
nonconsenting individual but do not report any significant or sustained
sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another
individual.

Since these individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving sexual
arousal to pain and suffering, it follows that they would also deny
feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses.
Such individuals may be diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder despite
their negative self-report. Their recurrent behavior constitutes
clinical support for the presence of the paraphilia of sexual sadism (by
satisfying Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that their
paraphilically motivated behavior is causing clinically significant
distress, harm, or risk of harm to others (satisfying Criterion B).

"Recurrent" sexual sadism involving nonconsenting others (i.e., multiple
victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as general rule, be
interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer
victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion, if there are
multiple instances of infliction of pain and suffering to the same
victim, or if there is corroborating evidence of a strong or
preferential interest in pain and suffering involving multiple victims.
Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but
not a necessary condition for diagnosis, as the criteria may be met if
the individual acknowledges intense sadistic sexual interest.

The Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of
sexual sadism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be
understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure
that the sexual interest in inflicting pain and suffering on
nonconsenting victims is not merely transient. However, the diagnosis
may be met if there is a clearly sustained but shorter period of
sadistic behaviors.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The extensive use of pornography involving the infliction of pain and
suffering is sometimes an associated feature of sexual sadism disorder.

Prevalence

The population prevalence of sexual sadism disorder is unknown and is
largely based on individuals in forensic settings. Depending on the
criteria for sexual sadism, prevalence varies widely, from 2% to 30%.
Among civilly committed sexual offenders in the United States, less than
10% have sexual sadism. Among individuals who have committed sexually
motivated homicides, rates of sexual sadism disorder range from 37% to
75%.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p742}Pedophilic Disorder

**697**

Development and Course

Individuals with sexual sadism in forensic samples are almost
exclusively male, but a representative sample of the population in
Australia reported that 2.2% of men and 1.3% of women said they had been
involved in bondage and discipline, "sadomasochism," or dominance and
submission in the previous year. Information on the development and
course of sexual sadism disorder is extremely limited. One study
reported that females became aware of their sadomasochistic interest as
young adults, and another reported that the mean age at onset of sadism
in a group of males was 19.4 years. Whereas sexual sadism per se is
probably a lifelong characteristic, sexual sadism disorder may fluctuate
according to the individual's subjective distress or his or her
propensity to harm nonconsenting others.

Advancing age is likely to have the same reducing effect on this
disorder as it has on other paraphilic or normophilic sexual behavior.

Differential Diagnosis

Many of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for sexual
sadism disorder (e.g., antisocial personality disorder, sexual masochism
disorder, hypersexuality, substance use disorders) sometimes occur also
as comorbid diagnoses. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully evaluate
the evidence for sexual sadism disorder, keeping the possibility of
other paraphilias or mental disorders as part of the differential
diagnosis. The majority of individuals who are active in community
networks that practice sadistic and masochistic behaviors do not express
any dissatisfaction with their sexual interests, and their behavior
would not meet DSM-5 criteria for sexual sadism disorder. Sadistic
interest, but not the disorder, may be considered in the differential
diagnosis.

Comorbidity

Known comorbidities with sexual sadism disorder are largely based on
individuals (almost all males) convicted for criminal acts involving
sadistic acts against nonconsenting victims. Hence, these comorbidities
might not apply to all individuals who never engaged in sadistic
activity with a nonconsenting victim but who qualify for a diagnosis of
sexual sadism disorder based on subjective distress over their sexual
interest. Disorders that are commonly comorbid with sexual sadism
disorder include other paraphilic disorders.

Pedophilic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.2 (F65.4)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually
arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity
with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or
younger).

B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges
or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.

C. The individual is at least age 16 years and at least 5 years older
than the child or children in Criterion A.

**Note:** Do not include an individual in late adolescence involved in
an ongoing sexual relationship with a 12-or 13-year-old.

*Specify* whether:

**Exclusive type** (attracted only to children)

**Nonexclusive type**

[]{#index_split_073.html#p743}**698**

Paraphilic Disorders

*Specify* if:

**Sexually attracted to males**

**Sexually attracted to females**

**Sexually attracted to both**

*Specify* if:

**Limited to incest**

Diagnostic Features

The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply
both to individuals who freely disclose this paraphilia and to
individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepubertal children
(generally age 13 years or younger), despite substantial objective
evidence to the contrary. Examples of disclosing this paraphilia include
candidly acknowledging an intense sexual interest in children and
indicating that sexual interest in children is greater than or equal to
sexual interest in physically mature individuals. If individuals also
complain that their sexual attractions or preferences for children are
causing psychosocial difficulties, they may be diagnosed with pedophilic
disorder. However, if they report an absence of feelings of guilt,
shame, or anxiety about these impulses and are not functionally limited
by their paraphilic impulses (according to self-report, objective
assessment, or both), and their self-reported and legally recorded
histories indicate that they have never acted on their impulses, then
these individuals have a pedophilic sexual interest but not pedophilic
disorder.

Examples of individuals who deny attraction to children include
individuals who are known to have sexually approached multiple children
on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies about sexual
behavior involving children, and who may further claim that the known
episodes of physical contact were all unintentional and nonsexual. Other
individuals may acknowledge past episodes of sexual behavior involving
children but deny any significant or sustained sexual interest in
children. Since these individuals may deny experiences impulses or
fantasies involving children, they may also deny feeling subjectively
distressed. Such individuals may still be diagnosed with pedophilic
disorder despite the absence of self-reported distress, provided that
there is evidence of recurrent behaviors persisting for 6 months
(Criterion A) and evidence that the individual has acted on sexual urges
or experienced interpersonal difficulties as a consequence of the
disorder (Criterion B).

Presence of multiple victims, as discussed above, is sufficient but not
necessary for diagnosis; that is, the individual can still meet
Criterion A by merely acknowledging intense or preferential sexual
interest in children.

The Criterion A clause, indicating that the signs or symptoms of
pedophilia have persisted for 6 months or longer, is intended to ensure
that the sexual attraction to children is not merely transient. However,
the diagnosis may be made if there is clinical evidence of sustained
persistence of the sexual attraction to children even if the 6-month
duration cannot be precisely determined.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The extensive use of pornography depicting prepubescent children is a
useful diagnostic indicator of pedophilic disorder. This is a specific
instance of the general case that individuals are likely to choose the
kind of pornography that corresponds to their sexual interests.

Prevalence

The population prevalence of pedophilic disorder is unknown. The highest
possible prevalence for pedophilic disorder in the male population is
approximately 3%--5%. The population prevalence of pedophilic disorder
in females is even more uncertain, but it is likely a small fraction of
the prevalence in males.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p744}Pedophilic Disorder

**699**

Development and Course

Adult males with pedophilic disorder may indicate that they become aware
of strong or preferential sexual interest in children around the time of
puberty---the same time frame in which males who later prefer physically
mature partners became aware of their sexual interest in women or men.
Attempting to diagnose pedophilic disorder at the age at which it first
manifests is problematic because of the difficulty during adolescent
development in differentiating it from age-appropriate sexual interest
in peers or from sexual curiosity.

Hence, Criterion C requires for diagnosis a minimum age of 16 years and
at least 5 years older than the child or children in Criterion A.

Pedophilia per se appears to be a lifelong condition. Pedophilic
disorder, however, necessarily includes other elements that may change
over time with or without treatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt,
shame, intense sexual frustration, or feelings of isolation) or
psychosocial impairment, or the propensity to act out sexually with
children, or both.

Therefore, the course of pedophilic disorder may fluctuate, increase, or
decrease with age.

Adults with pedophilic disorder may report an awareness of sexual
interest in children that preceded engaging in sexual behavior involving
children or self-identification as a pedo-phile. Advanced age is as
likely to similarly diminish the frequency of sexual behavior involving
children as it does other paraphilically motivated and normophilic
sexual behavior.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

There appears to be an interaction between pedophilia and
antisocial-ity, such that males with both traits are more likely to act
out sexually with children. Thus, antisocial personality disorder may be
considered a risk factor for pedophilic disorder in males with
pedophilia.

Environmental.

Adult males with pedophilia often report that they were sexually abused
as children. It is unclear, however, whether this correlation reflects a
causal influence of childhood sexual abuse on adult pedophilia.

Genetic and physiological.

Since pedophilia is a necessary condition for pedophilic disorder, any
factor that increases the probability of pedophilia also increases the
risk of pedophilic disorder. There is some evidence that
neurodevelopmental perturbation in utero increases the probability of
development of a pedophilic interest.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Psychophysiological laboratory measures of sexual interest, which are
sometimes useful in diagnosing pedophilic disorder in males, are not
necessarily useful in diagnosing this disorder in females, even when an
identical procedure (e.g., viewing time) or analogous procedures (e.g.,
penile plethysmography and vaginal photoplethysmography) are available.

Diagnostic Markers

Psychophysiological measures of sexual interest may sometimes be useful
when an individual's history suggests the possible presence of
pedophilic disorder but the individual denies strong or preferential
attraction to children. The most thoroughly researched and longest used
of such measures is *penile plethysmography*, although the sensitivity
and specificity of diagnosis may vary from one site to another. *Viewing
time,* using photographs of nude or minimally clothed persons as visual
stimuli, is also used to diagnose pedophilic disorder, especially in
combination with self-report measures. Mental health professionals in
the United States, however, should be aware that possession of such
visual stimuli, even for diagnostic purposes, may violate American law
regarding possession of child pornography and leave the mental health
professional susceptible to criminal prosecution.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p745}**700**

Paraphilic Disorders

Differential Diagnosis

Many of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for
pedophilic disorder also sometimes occur as comorbid diagnoses. It is
therefore generally necessary to evaluate the evidence for pedophilic
disorder and other possible conditions as separate questions.

Antisocial personality disorder.

This disorder increases the likelihood that a person who is primarily
attracted to the mature physique will approach a child, on one or a few
occasions, on the basis of relative availability. The individual often
shows other signs of this personality disorder, such as recurrent
law-breaking.

Alcohol and substance use disorders.

The disinhibiting effects of intoxication may also

increase the likelihood that a person who is primarily attracted to the
mature physique will sexually approach a child.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

There are occasional individuals who complain about

ego-dystonic thoughts and worries about possible attraction to children.
Clinical interviewing usually reveals an absence of sexual thoughts
about children during high states of sexual arousal (e.g., approaching
orgasm during masturbation) and sometimes additional ego-dystonic,
intrusive sexual ideas (e.g., concerns about homosexuality).

Comorbidity

Psychiatric comorbidity of pedophilic disorder includes substance use
disorders; depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders; antisocial
personality disorder; and other paraphilic disorders. However, findings
on comorbid disorders are largely among individuals convicted for sexual
offenses involving children (almost all males) and may not be
generalizable to other individuals with pedophilic disorder (e.g.,
individuals who have never approached a child sexually but who qualify
for the diagnosis of pedophilic disorder on the basis of subjective
distress).

Fetishistic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.81 (F65.0)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
arousal from either the use of nonliving objects or a highly specific
focus on nongenital body part(s), as manifested by fantasies, urges, or
behaviors.

B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning.

C. The fetish objects are not limited to articles of clothing used in
cross-dressing (as in transvestic disorder) or devices specifically
designed for the purpose of tactile genital stimulation (e.g.,
vibrator).

*Specify:*

**Body part(s)**

**Nonliving object(s)**

**Other**

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable
to individuals living in institutional or other settings where
opportunities to engage in fetishistic behaviors are restricted.

**In full remission:** There has been no distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years
while in an uncontrolled environment.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p746}Fetishistic Disorder

**701**

Specifiers

Although individuals with fetishistic disorder may report intense and
recurrent sexual arousal to inanimate objects or a specific body part,
it is not unusual for non--mutually exclusive combinations of fetishes
to occur. Thus, an individual may have fetishistic disorder associated
with an inanimate object (e.g., female undergarments) or an exclusive
focus on an intensely eroticized body part (e.g., feet, hair), or their
fetishistic interest may meet criteria for various combinations of these
specifiers (e.g., socks, shoes and feet).

Diagnostic Features

The paraphilic focus of fetishistic disorder involves the persistent and
repetitive use of or dependence on nonliving objects or a highly
specific focus on a (typically nongenital) body part as primary elements
associated with sexual arousal (Criterion A). A diagnosis of fetishistic
disorder must include clinically significant personal distress or
psychosocial role impairment (Criterion B). Common fetish objects
include female undergarments, male or female footwear, rubber articles,
leather clothing, or other wearing apparel. Highly eroticized body parts
associated with fetishistic disorder include feet, toes, and hair. It is
not uncommon for sexualized fetishes to include both inanimate objects
and body parts (e.g., dirty socks and feet), and for this reason the
definition of fetishistic disorder now re-incorporates *partialism*
(i.e., an exclusive focus on a body part) into its boundaries.
Partialism, previously considered a paraphilia not otherwise specified
disorder, had historically been subsumed in fetishism prior to DSM-III.

Many individuals who self-identify as fetishist practitioners do not
necessarily report clinical impairment in association with their
fetish-associated behaviors. Such individuals could be considered as
having a fetish but not fetishistic disorder. A diagnosis of fetishistic
disorder requires concurrent fulfillment of both the behaviors in
Criterion A and the clinically significant distress or impairment in
functioning noted in Criterion B.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Fetishistic disorder can be a multisensory experience, including
holding, tasting, rubbing, inserting, or smelling the fetish object
while masturbating, or preferring that a sexual partner wear or utilize
a fetish object during sexual encounters. Some individuals may acquire
extensive collections of highly desired fetish objects.

Development and Course

Usually paraphilias have an onset during puberty, but fetishes can
develop prior to adolescence. Once established, fetishistic disorder
tends to have a continuous course that fluctuates in intensity and
frequency of urges or behavior.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Knowledge of and appropriate consideration for normative aspects of
sexual behavior are important factors to explore to establish a clinical
diagnosis of fetishistic disorder and to distinguish a clinical
diagnosis from a socially acceptable sexual behavior.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Fetishistic disorder has not been systematically reported to occur in
females. In clinical samples, fetishistic disorder is nearly exclusively
reported in males.

Functional Consequences of Fetishistic Disorder

Typical impairments associated with fetishistic disorder include sexual
dysfunction during romantic reciprocal relationships when the preferred
fetish object or body part is

[]{#index_split_073.html#p747}**702**

Paraphilic Disorders

unavailable during foreplay or coitus. Some individuals with fetishistic
disorder may prefer solitary sexual activity associated with their
fetishistic preference(s) even while involved in a meaningful reciprocal
and affectionate relationship.

Although fetishistic disorder is relatively uncommon among arrested
sexual offenders with paraphilias, males with fetishistic disorder may
steal and collect their particular fetishistic objects of desire. Such
individuals have been arrested and charged for nonsexual antisocial
behaviors (e.g., breaking and entering, theft, burglary) that are
primarily motivated by the fetishistic disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Transvestic disorder.

The nearest diagnostic neighbor of fetishistic disorder is transvestic
disorder. As noted in the diagnostic criteria, fetishistic disorder is
not diagnosed when fetish objects are limited to articles of clothing
exclusively worn during cross-dressing (as in transvestic disorder), or
when the object is genitally stimulating because it has been designed
for that purpose (e.g., a vibrator).

Sexual masochism disorder or other paraphilic disorders.

Fetishes can co-occur with

other paraphilic disorders, especially "sadomasochism" and transvestic
disorder. When an individual fantasizes about or engages in "forced
cross-dressing" and is primarily sexually aroused by the domination or
humiliation associated with such fantasy or repetitive activity, the
diagnosis of sexual masochism disorder should be made.

Fetishistic behavior without fetishistic disorder.

Use of a fetish object for sexual arousal

without any associated distress or psychosocial role impairment or other
adverse consequence would not meet criteria for fetishistic disorder, as
the threshold required by Criterion B would not be met. For example, an
individual whose sexual partner either shares or can successfully
incorporate his interest in caressing, smelling, or licking feet or toes
as an important element of foreplay would not be diagnosed with
fetishistic disorder; nor would an individual who prefers, and is not
distressed or impaired by, solitary sexual behavior associated with
wearing rubber garments or leather boots.

Comorbidity

Fetishistic disorder may co-occur with other paraphilic disorders as
well as hypersexuality. Rarely, fetishistic disorder may be associated
with neurological conditions.

Transvestic Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

**302.3 (F65.1)**

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
arousal from cross-dressing, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or
behaviors.

B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning.

*Specify* if:

**With fetishism:** If sexually aroused by fabrics, materials, or
garments.

**With autogynephilia:** If sexually aroused by thoughts or images of
self as female.

*Specify* if:

**In a controlled environment:** This specifier is primarily applicable
to individuals living in institutional or other settings where
opportunities to cross-dress are restricted.

**In full remission:** There has been no distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years
while in an uncontrolled environment.

[]{#index_split_073.html#p748}Transvestic Disorder

**703**

Specifiers

The presence of fetishism decreases the likelihood of gender dysphoria
in men with transvestic disorder. The presence of autogynephilia
increases the likelihood of gender dysphoria in men with transvestic
disorder.

Diagnostic Features

The diagnosis of transvestic disorder does not apply to all individuals
who dress as the opposite sex, even those who do so habitually. It
applies to individuals whose cross-dressing or thoughts of
cross-dressing are always or often accompanied by sexual excitement
(Criterion A) and who are emotionally distressed by this pattern or feel
it impairs social or interpersonal functioning (Criterion B). The
cross-dressing may involve only one or two articles of clothing (e.g.,
for men, it may pertain only to women's undergarments), or it may
involve dressing completely in the inner and outer garments of the other
sex and (in men) may include the use of women's wigs and make-up.
Transvestic disorder is nearly exclusively reported in males. Sexual
arousal, in its most obvious form of penile erection, may co-occur with
cross-dressing in various ways. In younger males, cross-dressing often
leads to masturbation, following which any female clothing is removed.
Older males often learn to avoid masturbating or doing anything to
stimulate the penis so that the avoidance of ejaculation allows them to
prolong their cross-dressing session. Males with female partners
sometimes complete a cross-dressing session by having intercourse with
their partners, and some have difficulty maintaining a sufficient
erection for intercourse without cross-dressing (or private fantasies of
cross-dressing).

Clinical assessment of distress or impairment, like clinical assessment
of transvestic sexual arousal, is usually dependent on the individual's
self-report. The pattern of behavior "purging and acquisition" often
signifies the presence of distress in individuals with transvestic
disorder. During this behavioral pattern, an individual (usually a man)
who has spent a great deal of money on women's clothes and other apparel
(e.g., shoes, wigs) discards the items (i.e., purges them) in an effort
to overcome urges to cross-dress, and then begins acquiring a woman's
wardrobe all over again.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Transvestic disorder in men is often accompanied by *autogynephilia*
(i.e., a male's paraphilic tendency to be sexually aroused by the
thought or image of himself as a woman).

Autogynephilic fantasies and behaviors may focus on the idea of
exhibiting female physiological functions (e.g., lactation,
menstruation), engaging in stereotypically feminine behavior (e.g.,
knitting), or possessing female anatomy (e.g., breasts).

Prevalence

The prevalence of transvestic disorder is unknown. Transvestic disorder
is rare in males and extremely rare in females. Fewer than 3% of males
report having ever been sexually aroused by dressing in women's attire.
The percentage of individuals who have cross-dressed with sexual arousal
more than once or a few times in their lifetimes would be even lower.
The majority of males with transvestic disorder identify as
heterosexual, although some individuals have occasional sexual
interaction with other males, especially when they are cross-dressed.

Development and Course

In males, the first signs of transvestic disorder may begin in
childhood, in the form of strong fascination with a particular item of
women's attire. Prior to puberty, cross-dressing produces generalized
feelings of pleasurable excitement. With the arrival of puberty,
dressing in women's clothes begins to elicit penile erection and, in
some cases, leads di-

[]{#index_split_073.html#p749}**704**

Paraphilic Disorders

rectly to first ejaculation. In many cases, cross-dressing elicits less
and less sexual excitement as the individual grows older; eventually it
may produce no discernible penile response at all. The desire to
cross-dress, at the same time, remains the same or grows even stronger.
Individuals who report such a diminution of sexual response typically
report that the sexual excitement of cross-dressing has been replaced by
feelings of comfort or well-being.

In some cases, the course of transvestic disorder is continuous, and in
others it is episodic. It is not rare for men with transvestic disorder
to lose interest in cross-dressing when they first fall in love with a
woman and begin a relationship, but such abatement usually proves
temporary. When the desire to cross-dress returns, so does the
associated distress.

Some cases of transvestic disorder progress to gender dysphoria. The
males in these cases, who may be indistinguishable from others with
transvestic disorder in adolescence or early childhood, gradually
develop desires to remain in the female role for longer periods and to
feminize their anatomy. The development of gender dysphoria is usually
accompanied by a (self-reported) reduction or elimination of sexual
arousal in association with cross-dressing.

The manifestation of transvestism in penile erection and stimulation,
like the manifestation of other paraphilic as well as normophilic sexual
interests, is most intense in adolescence and early adulthood. The
severity of transvestic disorder is highest in adulthood, when the
transvestic drives are most likely to conflict with performance in
heterosexual intercourse and desires to marry and start a family.
Middle-age and older men with a history of transvestism are less likely
to present with transvestic disorder than with gender dysphoria.

Functional Consequences of Transvestic Disorder

Engaging in transvestic behaviors can interfere with, or detract from,
heterosexual relationships. This can be a source of distress to men who
wish to maintain conventional marriages or romantic partnerships with
women.

Differential Diagnosis

Fetishistic disorder.

This disorder may resemble transvestic disorder, in particular, in men
with fetishism who put on women's undergarments while masturbating with
them.

Distinguishing transvestic disorder depends on the individual's specific
thoughts during such activity (e.g., are there any ideas of being a
woman, being like a woman, or being dressed as a woman?) and on the
presence of other fetishes (e.g., soft, silky fabrics, whether these are
used for garments or for something else).

Gender dysphoria.

Individuals with transvestic disorder do not report an incongruence
between their experienced gender and assigned gender nor a desire to be
of the other gender; and they typically do not have a history of
childhood cross-gender behaviors, which would be present in individuals
with gender dysphoria. Individuals with a presentation that meets full
criteria for transvestic disorder as well as gender dysphoria should be
given both diagnoses.

Comorbidity

Transvestism (and thus transvestic disorder) is often found in
association with other paraphilias. The most frequently co-occurring
paraphilias are fetishism and masochism. One particularly dangerous form
of masochism, *autoerotic asphyxia,* is associated with transvestism in
a substantial proportion of fatal cases.

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a paraphilic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the paraphilic disorders diagnostic class. The other

intense sexual arousal involving *telephone* *scatologia* (obscene phone
calls), *necrophilia* (corpses), *zoophilia* (animals), *coprophilia*

[]{#index_split_074.html#p754}**Medication-Induced Movement**

**Disorders and Other Adverse**

**Effects of Medication**

Medication-induced movement disorders are included in Section II because
of their frequent importance in 1) the management by medication of
mental disorders or other medical conditions and 2) the differential
diagnosis of mental disorders (e.g., anxiety disorder versus
neuroleptic-induced akathisia; malignant catatonia versus neuroleptic
malignant syndrome). Although these movement disorders are labeled
"medication induced," it is often difficult to establish the causal
relationship between medication exposure and the development of the
movement disorder, especially because some of these movement disorders
also occur in the absence of medication exposure. The conditions and
problems listed in this chapter are not mental disorders.

The term *neuroleptic* is becoming outdated because it highlights the
propensity of antipsychotic medications to cause abnormal movements, and
it is being replaced with the term *antipsychotic* in many contexts.
Nevertheless, the term *neuroleptic* remains appropriate in this
context. Although newer antipsychotic medications may be less likely to
cause some medication-induced movement disorders, those disorders still
occur. Neuroleptic medications include so-called conventional,
"typical," or first-generation antipsychotic agents (e.g.,
chlorpromazine, haloperidol, fluphenazine); "atypical" or
second-generation antipsychotic agents (e.g., clozapine, risperidone,
olanzapine, quetiapine); certain dopamine receptor--blocking drugs used
in the treatment of symptoms such as nausea and gastroparesis (e.g.,
prochlorperazine, promethazine, trimethobenzamide, thiethylperazine,
metoclopramide); and amoxapine, which is marketed as an antidepressant.

**Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome**

Although neuroleptic malignant syndrome is easily recognized in its

presentation, progression, and outcome. The clinical features described
below are those considered most important in making the diagnosis of
neuroleptic malignant syndrome based on consensus recommendations.

**709**

[]{#index_split_074.html#p755}**710**

Medication-Induced Movement Disorders

Diagnostic Features

Patients have generally been exposed to a dopamine antagonist within 72
hours prior to symptom development. Hyperthermia (100.4F or 38.0C on
at least two occasions, measured orally), associated with profuse
diaphoresis, is a distinguishing feature of neuroleptic malignant
syndrome, setting it apart from other neurological side effects of
antipsychotic medications. Extreme elevations in temperature, reflecting
a breakdown in central thermoregulation, are more likely to support the
diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Generalized rigidity,
described as "lead pipe" in its most severe form and usually
unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agents, is a cardinal feature of the
disorder and may be associated with other neurological symptoms (e.g.,
tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia, dystonia, trismus, myoclonus, dysarthria,
dysphagia, rhabdomyolysis). Creatine kinase elevation of at least four
times the upper limit of normal is commonly seen. Changes in mental
status, characterized by delirium or altered consciousness ranging from
stupor to coma, are often an early sign. Affected individuals may appear
alert but dazed and unresponsive, consistent with catatonic stupor.
Autonomic activation and instability---manifested by tachycardia
(rate25% above baseline), diaphoresis, blood pressure elevation
(systolic or diastolic 25% above baseline) or fluctuation (20 mmHg
diastolic change or 25 mmHg systolic change within 24 hours), urinary
incontinence, and pallor---may be seen at any time but provide an early
clue to the diagnosis. Tachypnea (rate 50% above baseline) is common,
and respiratory distress---resulting from metabolic acidosis,
hyper-metabolism, chest wall restriction, aspiration pneumonia, or
pulmonary emboli---can occur and lead to sudden respiratory arrest.

A workup, including laboratory investigation, to exclude other
infectious, toxic, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric etiologies or
complications is essential (see the section "Differential Diagnosis"
later in this discussion). Although several laboratory abnormalities are
associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, no single abnormality is
specific to the diagnosis. Individuals with neuroleptic malignant
syndrome may have leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, decreased
serum iron concentrations, and elevations in serum muscle enzymes and
catecholamines. Findings from cerebrospinal fluid analysis and
neuroimaging studies are generally normal, whereas
electroencephalography shows generalized slowing. Autopsy findings in
fatal cases have been nonspecific and variable, depending on
complications.

Development and Course

Evidence from database studies suggests incidence rates for neuroleptic
malignant syndrome of 0.01%--0.02% among individuals treated with
antipsychotics. The temporal progression of signs and symptoms provides
important clues to the diagnosis and prognosis of neuroleptic malignant
syndrome. Alteration in mental status and other neurological signs
typically precede systemic signs. The onset of symptoms varies from
hours to days after drug initiation. Some cases develop within 24 hours
after drug initiation, most within the first week, and virtually all
cases within 30 days. Once the syndrome is diagnosed and oral
antipsychotic drugs are discontinued, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is
self-limited in most cases. The mean recovery time after drug
discontinuation is 7--10 days, with most individuals recovering within 1
week and nearly all within 30 days. The duration may be prolonged when
long-acting antipsychotics are implicated. There have been reports of
individuals in whom residual neurological signs persisted for weeks
after the acute hyper-metabolic symptoms resolved. Total resolution of
symptoms can be obtained in most cases of neuroleptic malignant
syndrome; however, fatality rates of 10%--20% have been reported when
the disorder is not recognized. Although many individuals do not
experience a recurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome when
rechallenged with antipsychotic medication, some do, especially when
antipsychotics are reinstituted soon after an episode.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potential risk in any individual
after antipsychotic drug administration. It is not specific to any
neuropsychiatric diagnosis and may occur in individuals without a
diagnosable mental disorder who receive dopamine antagonists.

Clinical, systemic, and metabolic factors associated with a heightened
risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome include agitation, exhaustion,
dehydration, and iron deficiency. A prior episode associated with
antipsychotics has been described in 15%--20% of index cases, suggesting
underlying vulnerability in some patients; however, genetic findings
based on neurotransmitter receptor polymorphisms have not been
replicated consistently.

Nearly all dopamine antagonists have been associated with neuroleptic
malignant syndrome, although high-potency antipsychotics pose a greater
risk compared with low-potency agents and newer atypical antipsychotics.
Partial or milder forms may be associated with newer antipsychotics, but
neuroleptic malignant syndrome varies in severity even with older drugs.
Dopamine antagonists used in medical settings (e.g., metoclopramide,
prochlorperazine) have also been implicated. Parenteral administration
routes, rapid titration rates, and higher total drug dosages have been
associated with increased risk; however, neuroleptic malignant syndrome
usually occurs within the therapeutic dosage range of antipsychotics.

Differential Diagnosis

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome must be distinguished from other serious
neurological or medical conditions, including central nervous system
infections, inflammatory or autoimmune conditions, status epilepticus,
subcortical structural lesions, and systemic conditions (e.g.,
pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, tetanus, heat stroke).

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome also must be distinguished from similar
syndromes resulting from the use of other substances or medications,
such as serotonin syndrome; parkinsonian hyperthermia syndrome following
abrupt discontinuation of dopamine agonists; alcohol or sedative
withdrawal; malignant hyperthermia occurring during anesthesia;
hyperthermia associated with abuse of stimulants and hallucinogens; and
atropine poisoning from anticholinergics.

In rare instances, individuals with schizophrenia or a mood disorder may
present with malignant catatonia, which may be indistinguishable from
neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Some investigators consider neuroleptic
malignant syndrome to be a drug-induced form of malignant catatonia.

Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia

333.72 (G24.02)

**Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia**

Abnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes
(oculogyric crisis), head, neck (torticollis or retrocollis), limbs, or
trunk developing within a few days of starting or raising the dosage of
a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a
medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.

Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia

333.99 (G25.71)

**Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia**

Subjective complaints of restlessness, often accompanied by observed
excessive movements (e.g., fidgety movements of the legs, rocking from
foot to foot, pacing, inability to sit or stand still), developing
within a few weeks of starting or raising the dosage of a medication
(such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication
used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.

[]{#index_split_074.html#p757}**712**

Medication-Induced Movement Disorders

Tardive Dyskinesia

333.85 (G24.01)

**Tardive Dyskinesia**

Involuntary athetoid or choreiform movements (lasting at least a few
weeks) generally of the tongue, lower face and jaw, and extremities (but
sometimes involving the pharyngeal, diaphragmatic, or trunk muscles)
developing in association with the use of a neuroleptic medication for
at least a few months.

Symptoms may develop after a shorter period of medication use in older
persons. In some patients, movements of this type may appear after
discontinuation, or after change or reduction in dosage, of neuroleptic
medications, in which case the condition is called *neuroleptic
withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia.* Because withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia
is usually time-limited, lasting less than 4--8 weeks, dyskinesia that
persists beyond this window is considered to be tardive dyskinesia.

Tardive Dystonia

Tardive Akathisia

333.72 (G24.09)

**Tardive Dystonia**

333.99 (G25.71)

**Tardive Akathisia**

Tardive syndrome involving other types of movement problems, such as
dystonia or akathisia, which are distinguished by their late emergence
in the course of treatment and their potential persistence for months to
years, even in the face of neuroleptic discontinuation or dosage
reduction.

Medication-Induced Postural Tremor

333.1 (G25.1)

**Medication-Induced Postural Tremor**

Fine tremor (usually in the range of 8--12 Hz) occurring during attempts
to maintain a posture and developing in association with the use of
medication (e.g., lithium, antidepressants, valproate). This tremor is
very similar to the tremor seen with anxiety, caffeine, and other
stimulants.

Other Medication-Induced Movement Disorder

333.99 (G25.79)

**Other Medication-Induced Movement Disorder**

This category is for medication-induced movement disorders not captured
by any of the specific disorders listed above. Examples include 1)
presentations resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome that are
associated with medications other than neuroleptics and 2) other
medication-induced tardive conditions.

Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome

995.29 (T43.205D) **Subsequent encounter**

995.29 (T43.205S) **Sequelae**

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a set of symptoms that can
occur after an abrupt cessation (or marked reduction in dose) of an
antidepressant medication that was taken continuously for at least 1
month. Symptoms generally begin within 2--4 days and typically include
specific sensory, somatic, and cognitive-emotional manifestations. Fre-

[]{#index_split_074.html#p758}Medication-Induced Movement Disorders
**713**

quently reported sensory and somatic symptoms include flashes of lights,
"electric shock"

sensations, nausea, and hyperresponsivity to noises or lights.
Nonspecific anxiety and feelings of dread may also be reported. Symptoms
are alleviated by restarting the same medication or starting a different
medication that has a similar mechanism of action---

for example, discontinuation symptoms after withdrawal from a
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor may be alleviated by
starting a tricyclic antidepressant. To qualify as antidepressant
discontinuation syndrome, the symptoms should not have been present
before the antidepressant dosage was reduced and are not better
explained by another mental disorder (e.g., manic or hypomanic episode,
substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, somatic symptom disorder).

Diagnostic Features

Discontinuation symptoms may occur following treatment with tricyclic
antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine),
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine,
sertraline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine,
selegi-line, pargyline). The incidence of this syndrome depends on the
dosage and half-life of the medication being taken, as well as the rate
at which the medication is tapered. Short-acting medications that are
stopped abruptly rather than tapered gradually may pose the greatest
risk. The short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
paroxetine is the agent most commonly associated with discontinuation
symptoms, but such symptoms occur for all types of antidepressants.

Unlike withdrawal syndromes associated with opioids, alcohol, and other
substances of abuse, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome has no
pathognomonic symptoms. Instead, the symptoms tend to be vague and
variable and typically begin 2--4 days after the last dose of the
antidepressant. For SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine), symptoms such as
dizziness, ringing in the ears, "electric shocks in the head," an
inability to sleep, and acute anxiety are described. The antidepressant
use prior to discontinuation must not have incurred hypomania or
euphoria (i.e., there should be confidence that the discontinuation
syndrome is not the result of fluctuations in mood stability associated
with the previous treatment).

The antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is based solely on
pharmacological factors and is not related to the reinforcing effects of
an antidepressant. Also, in the case of stimulant augmentation of an
antidepressant, abrupt cessation may result in stimulant withdrawal
symptoms (see "Stimulant Withdrawal" in the chapter "Substance-Related
and Addictive Disorders") rather than the antidepressant discontinuation
syndrome described here.

Prevalence

The prevalence of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is unknown but
is thought to vary according to the dosage prior to discontinuation, the
half-life and receptor-binding affinity of the medication, and possibly
the individual's genetically influenced rate of metabolism for this
medication.

Course and Development

Because longitudinal studies are lacking, little is known about the
clinical course of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Symptoms
appear to abate over time with very gradual dosage reductions. After an
episode, some individuals may prefer to resume medication indefinitely
if tolerated.

Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome
includes anxiety and depressive disorders, substance use disorders, and
tolerance to medications.

[]{#index_split_074.html#p759}**714**

Medication-Induced Movement Disorders

Anxiety and depressive disorders.

Discontinuation symptoms often resemble symptoms

of a persistent anxiety disorder or a return of somatic symptoms of
depression for which the medication was initially given.

Substance use disorders.

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome differs from substance
withdrawal in that antidepressants themselves have no reinforcing or
euphoric effects. The medication dosage has usually not been increased
without the clinician's permission, and the individual generally does
not engage in drug-seeking behavior to obtain additional medication.
Criteria for a substance use disorder are not met.

Tolerance to medications.

Tolerance and discontinuation symptoms can occur as a normal
physiological response to stopping medication after a substantial
duration of exposure. Most cases of medication tolerance can be managed
through carefully controlled tapering.

Comorbidity

Typically, the individual was initially started on the medication for a
major depressive disorder; the original symptoms may return during the
discontinuation syndrome.

995.20 (T50.905S) **Sequelae**

This category is available for optional use by clinicians to code side
effects of medication (other than movement symptoms) when these adverse
effects become a main focus of clinical attention. Examples include
severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and priapism.

[]{#index_split_074.html#p760}**Other Conditions That May Be**

**a Focus of Clinical Attention**

This discussion covers other conditions and problems that may be a focus
of clinical attention or that may otherwise affect the diagnosis,
course, prognosis, or treatment of a patient's mental disorder. These
conditions are presented with their corresponding codes from ICD-9-CM
(usually V codes) and ICD-10-CM (usually Z codes). A condition or
problem in this chapter may be coded if it is a reason for the current
visit or helps to explain the need for a test, procedure, or treatment.
Conditions and problems in this chapter may also be included in the
medical record as useful information on circumstances that may affect
the patient's care, regardless of their relevance to the current visit.

The conditions and problems listed in this chapter are not mental
disorders. Their inclusion in DSM-5 is meant to draw attention to the
scope of additional issues that may be encountered in routine clinical
practice and to provide a systematic listing that may be useful to
clinicians in documenting these issues.

Relational Problems

Key relationships, especially intimate adult partner relationships and
parent/caregiver-child relationships, have a significant impact on the
health of the individuals in these relationships. These relationships
can be health promoting and protective, neutral, or detri-mental to
health outcomes. In the extreme, these close relationships can be
associated with maltreatment or neglect, which has significant medical
and psychological consequences for the affected individual. A relational
problem may come to clinical attention either as the reason that the
individual seeks health care or as a problem that affects the course,
prognosis, or treatment of the individual's mental or other medical
disorder.

Problems Related to Family Upbringing

V61.20 (Z62.820)

**Parent-Child Relational Problem**

For this category, the term *parent* is used to refer to one of the
child's primary caregivers, who may be a biological, adoptive, or foster
parent or may be another relative (such as a grandparent) who fulfills a
parental role for the child. This category should be used when the main
focus of clinical attention is to address the quality of the
parent-child relationship or when the quality of the parent-child
relationship is affecting the course, prognosis, or treatment of a
mental or other medical disorder. Typically, the parent-child relational
problem is associated with impaired functioning in behavioral,
cognitive, or affective domains. Examples of behavioral problems include
inadequate parental control, supervision, and involvement with the
child; parental overprotection; excessive parental pressure; arguments
that escalate to threats of physical violence; and avoidance without
resolution of problems. Cognitive problems may include negative
attributions of the other's intentions, hostility toward or scapegoating
of the other, and unwarranted feelings of estrangement.

Affective problems may include feelings of sadness, apathy, or anger
about the other individual in the relationship. Clinicians should take
into account the developmental needs of the child and the cultural
context.

**715**

[]{#index_split_074.html#p761}**716**

Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention V61.8
(Z62.891)

**Sibling Relational Problem**

This category should be used when the focus of clinical attention is a
pattern of interaction among siblings that is associated with
significant impairment in individual or family functioning or with
development of symptoms in one or more of the siblings, or when a
sibling relational problem is affecting the course, prognosis, or
treatment of a sibling's mental or other medical disorder. This category
can be used for either children or adults if the focus is on the sibling
relationship. Siblings in this context include full, half-, step-,
foster, and adopted siblings.

V61.8 (Z62.29)

**Upbringing Away From Parents**

This category should be used when the main focus of clinical attention
pertains to issues regarding a child being raised away from the parents
or when this separate upbringing affects the course, prognosis, or
treatment of a mental or other medical disorder. The child could be one
who is under state custody and placed in kin care or foster care. The
child could also be one who is living in a nonparental relative's home,
or with friends, but whose out-of-home placement is not mandated or
sanctioned by the courts. Problems related to a child living in a group
home or orphanage are also included. This category excludes issues
related to V60.6 (Z59.3) children in boarding schools.

V61.29 (Z62.898)

**Child Affected by Parental Relationship Distress**

This category should be used when the focus of clinical attention is the
negative effects of parental relationship discord (e.g., high levels of
conflict, distress, or disparagement) on a child in the family,
including effects on the child's mental or other medical disorders.

Other Problems Related to Primary Support Group

V61.10 (Z63.0)

**Relationship Distress With Spouse or Intimate Partner** This category
should be used when the major focus of the clinical contact is to
address the quality of the intimate (spouse or partner) relationship or
when the quality of that relationship is affecting the course,
prognosis, or treatment of a mental or other medical disorder. Partners
can be of the same or different genders. Typically, the relationship
distress is associated with impaired functioning in behavioral,
cognitive, or affective domains. Examples of behavioral problems include
conflict resolution difficulty, withdrawal, and overinvolvement.
Cognitive problems can manifest as chronic negative attributions of the
other's intentions or dismissals of the partner's positive behaviors.
Affective problems would include chronic sadness, apathy, and/or anger
about the other partner.

**Note:** This category excludes clinical encounters for V61.1x (Z69.1x)
mental health services for spousal or partner abuse problems and V65.49
(Z70.9) sex counseling.

V61.03 (Z63.5)

**Disruption of Family by Separation or Divorce**

This category should be used when partners in an intimate adult couple
are living apart due to relationship problems or are in the process of
divorce.

V61.8 (Z63.8)

**High Expressed Emotion Level Within Family**

*Expressed emotion* is a construct used as a qualitative measure of the
"amount" of emotion---in particular, hostility, emotional
overinvolvement, and criticism directed toward a family member who is an
identified patient---displayed in the family environment. This category
should be used when a family's high level of expressed emotion is the
focus of clinical attention or is affecting the course, prognosis, or
treatment of a family member's mental or other medical disorder.

V62.82 (Z63.4)

**Uncomplicated Bereavement**

This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is a
normal reaction to the death of a loved one. As part of their reaction
to such a loss, some grieving individuals present with symptoms
characteristic of a major depressive episode---for example, feel-

[]{#index_split_074.html#p762}Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of
Clinical Attention **717**

ings of sadness and associated symptoms such as insomnia, poor appetite,
and weight loss. The bereaved individual typically regards the depressed
mood as "normal," although the individual may seek professional help for
relief of associated symptoms such as insomnia or anorexia. The duration
and expression of "normal" bereavement vary considerably among different
cultural groups. Further guidance in distinguishing grief from a major
depressive episode is provided in the criteria for major depressive
episode.

Abuse and Neglect

Maltreatment by a family member (e.g., caregiver, intimate adult
partner) or by a nonrel-ative can be the area of current clinical focus,
or such maltreatment can be an important factor in the assessment and
treatment of patients with mental or other medical disorders.

Because of the legal implications of abuse and neglect, care should be
used in assessing these conditions and assigning these codes. Having a
past history of abuse or neglect can influence diagnosis and treatment
response in a number of mental disorders, and may also be noted along
with the diagnosis.

For the following categories, in addition to listings of the confirmed
or suspected event of abuse or neglect, other codes are provided for use
if the current clinical encounter is to provide mental health services
to either the victim or the perpetrator of the abuse or neglect. A
separate code is also provided for designating a past history of abuse
or neglect.

**Coding Note for ICD-10-CM Abuse and Neglect Conditions** For T codes
only, the 7th character should be coded as follows: **A (initial
encounter) *---***Use while the patient is receiving active treatment
for the condition (e.g., surgical treatment, emergency department
encounter, evaluation and treatment by a new clinician); or

**D (subsequent encounter) *---***Use for encounters after the patient
has received active treatment for the condition and when he or she is
receiving routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery
phase (e.g., cast change or removal, removal of external or internal
fixation device, medication adjustment, other aftercare and follow-up
visits).

Child Maltreatment and Neglect Problems

Child Physical Abuse

Child physical abuse is nonaccidental physical injury to a
child---ranging from minor bruises to severe fractures or
death---occurring as a result of punching, beating, kicking, biting,
shaking, throwing, stabbing, choking, hitting (with a hand, stick,
strap, or other object), burning, or any other method that is inflicted
by a parent, caregiver, or other individual who has responsibility for
the child. Such injury is considered abuse regardless of whether the
caregiver intended to hurt the child. Physical discipline, such as
spanking or paddling, is not considered abuse as long as it is
reasonable and causes no bodily injury to the child.

Child Sexual Abuse

Child sexual abuse encompasses any sexual act involving a child that is
intended to provide sexual gratification to a parent, caregiver, or
other individual who has responsibility for the child. Sexual abuse
includes activities such as fondling a child's genitals, penetration,
incest, rape, sodomy, and indecent exposure. Sexual abuse also includes
noncontact exploitation of a child by a parent or caregiver---for
example, forcing, tricking, enticing, threatening, or pressuring a child
to participate in acts for the sexual gratification of others, without
direct physical contact between child and abuser.

Child Neglect

Child neglect is defined as any confirmed or suspected egregious act or
omission by a child's parent or other caregiver that deprives the child
of basic age-appropriate needs and thereby results, or has reasonable
potential to result, in physical or psychological harm to the child.
Child neglect encompasses abandonment; lack of appropriate supervision;
failure to attend to necessary emotional or psychological needs; and
failure to provide necessary education, medical care, nourishment,
shelter, and/or clothing.

Child Psychological Abuse

Child psychological abuse is nonaccidental verbal or symbolic acts by a
child's parent or caregiver that result, or have reasonable potential to
result, in significant psychological harm to the child. (Physical and
sexual abusive acts are not included in this category.) Examples of
psychological abuse of a child include berating, disparaging, or
humiliating the child; threatening the child; harming/abandoning---or
indicating that the alleged offender will harm/abandon---people or
things that the child cares about; confining the child (as by tying a
child's arms or legs together or binding a child to furniture or another
object, or confining a child to a small enclosed area \[e.g., a
closet\]); egregious scapegoating of the child; coercing the child to
inflict pain on himself or herself; and disciplining the child
excessively (i.e., at an extremely high frequency or duration, even if
not at a level of physical abuse) through physical or nonphysical means.

Spouse or Partner Neglect

Partner neglect is any egregious act or omission in the past year by one
partner that deprives a dependent partner of basic needs and thereby
results, or has reasonable potential to result, in physical or
psychological harm to the dependent partner. This category is used in
the context of relationships in which one partner is extremely dependent
on the other partner for care or for assistance in navigating ordinary
daily activities---for example, a partner who is incapable of self-care
owing to substantial physical, psychological/intellectual, or cultural
limitations (e.g., inability to communicate with others and manage
everyday activities due to living in a foreign culture).

when such psychological abuse has occurred during the past year. Acts of
psychological abuse include berating or humiliating the victim;
interrogating the victim; restricting the victim's ability to come and
go freely; obstructing the victim's access to assistance (e.g., law
enforcement; legal, protective, or medical resources); threatening the
victim with physical harm or sexual assault; harming, or threatening to
harm, people or things that the victim cares about; unwarranted
restriction of the victim's access to or use of economic resources;
isolating the victim from family, friends, or social support resources;
stalking the victim; and trying to make the victim think that he or she
is crazy.

Adult Abuse by Nonspouse or Nonpartner

These categories should be used when an adult has been abused by another
adult who is not an intimate partner. Such maltreatment may involve acts
of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Examples of adult abuse include
nonaccidental acts of physical force (e.g., pushing/shoving, scratching,
slapping, throwing something that could hurt, punching, biting) that
have resulted---or have reasonable potential to result---in physical
harm or have caused significant fear; forced or coerced sexual acts; and
verbal or symbolic acts with the potential to cause psychological harm
(e.g., berating or humiliating the person; interrogating the person;
restricting the person's ability to come and go freely; obstructing the
person's access to assistance; threatening the person; harming or
threatening to harm people or things that the person cares about;
restricting the person's access to or use of economic resources;
isolating the person from family, friends, or social support resources;
stalking the person; trying to make the person think that he or she is
crazy). Acts for the purpose of physically protecting oneself or the
other person are excluded.

This category should be used when a lifestyle problem is a specific
focus of treatment or directly affects the course, prognosis, or
treatment of a mental or other medical disorder. Examples of lifestyle
problems include lack of physical exercise, inappropriate diet,
high-risk sexual behavior, and poor sleep hygiene. A problem that is
attributable to a symptom of a mental disorder should not be coded
unless that problem is a specific focus of treatment or directly affects
the course, prognosis, or treatment of the individual. In such cases,
both the mental disorder and the lifestyle problem should be coded.

V71.01 (Z72.811)

**Adult Antisocial Behavior**

This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is adult
antisocial behavior that is not due to a mental disorder (e.g., conduct
disorder, antisocial personality disorder). Examples include the
behavior of some professional thieves, racketeers, or dealers in illegal
substances.

V71.02 (Z72.810)

**Child or Adolescent Antisocial Behavior**

This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is
antisocial behavior in a child or adolescent that is not due to a mental
disorder (e.g., intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder).
Examples include isolated antisocial acts by children or adolescents
(not a pattern of antisocial behavior).

**Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Other Helping Agencies**
Nonadherence to Medical Treatment

V15.81 (Z91.19)

**Nonadherence to Medical Treatment**

This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is
nonadherence to an important aspect of treatment for a mental disorder
or another medical condition. Reasons for such nonadherence may include
discomfort resulting from treatment (e.g., medication side effects),
expense of treatment, personal value judgments or religious or cultural
beliefs about the proposed treatment, age-related debility, and the
presence of a mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, personality
disorder). This category should be used only when the problem is
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention and does
not meet diagnostic criteria for psychological factors affecting other
medical conditions.

278.00 (E66.9)

**Overweight or Obesity**

This category may be used when overweight or obesity is a focus of
clinical attention.

V65.2 (Z76.5)

**Malingering**

The essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of
false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms,
motivated by external incentives such as avoiding military duty,
avoiding work, obtaining financial compensation, evading criminal
prosecution, or obtaining drugs. Under some circumstances, malingering
may repre-

[]{#index_split_074.html#p772}Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of
Clinical Attention **727**

sent adaptive behavior---for example, feigning illness while a captive
of the enemy during wartime. Malingering should be strongly suspected if
any combination of the following is noted:

1\. Medicolegal context of presentation (e.g., the individual is
referred by an attorney to the clinician for examination, or the
individual self-refers while litigation or criminal charges are
pending).

2\. Marked discrepancy between the individual's claimed stress or
disability and the objective findings and observations.

3\. Lack of cooperation during the diagnostic evaluation and in
complying with the prescribed treatment regimen.

4\. The presence of antisocial personality disorder.

Malingering differs from factitious disorder in that the motivation for
the symptom production in malingering is an external incentive, whereas
in factitious disorder external incentives are absent. Malingering is
differentiated from conversion disorder and somatic symptom--related
mental disorders by the intentional production of symptoms and by the
obvious external incentives associated with it. Definite evidence of
feigning (such as clear evidence that loss of function is present during
the examination but not at home) would suggest a diagnosis of factitious
disorder if the individual's apparent aim is to assume the sick role, or
malingering if it is to obtain an incentive, such as money.

V40.31 (Z91.83)

**Wandering Associated With a Mental Disorder**

This category is used for individuals with a mental disorder whose
desire to walk about leads to significant clinical management or safety
concerns. For example, individuals with major neurocognitive or
neurodevelopmental disorders may experience a restless urge to wander
that places them at risk for falls and causes them to leave supervised
settings without needed accompaniment. This category excludes
individuals whose intent is to escape an unwanted housing situation
(e.g., children who are running away from home, patients who no longer
wish to remain in the hospital) or those who walk or pace as a result of
medication-induced akathisia.

V62.89 (R41.83)

**Borderline Intellectual Functioning**

This category can be used when an individual's borderline intellectual
functioning is the focus of clinical attention or has an impact on the
individual's treatment or prognosis. Differentiating borderline
intellectual functioning and mild intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder) requires careful assessment of intellectual and
adaptive functions and their discrepancies, particularly in the presence
of co-occurring mental disorders that may affect patient compliance with
standardized testing procedures (e.g., schizophrenia or
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with severe impulsivity).

A comprehensive review of the cultural context of mental disorders, and
the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) for clinical use, are provided.

Proposed disorders for future study are provided, which include a new
model for the diagnosis of personality disorders as an alternative to
the established diagnostic criteria; the proposed model incorporates
impairments in personality functioning as well as pathological
personality traits. Also included are new conditions that are the focus

[]{#index_split_074.html#p778} **Assessment**

**Measures**

A growing body of scientific evidence favors dimensional concepts in the
diagnosis of mental disorders. The limitations of a categorical approach
to diagnosis include the failure to find zones of rarity between
diagnoses (i.e., delineation of mental disorders from one another by
natural boundaries), the need for intermediate categories like
schizoaffective disorder, high rates of comorbidity, frequent
not-otherwise-specified (NOS) diagnoses, relative lack of utility in
furthering the identification of unique antecedent validators for most
mental disorders, and lack of treatment specificity for the various
diagnostic categories.

From both clinical and research perspectives, there is a need for a more
dimensional approach that can be combined with DSM's set of categorical
diagnoses. Such an approach incorporates variations of features within
an individual (e.g., differential severity of individual symptoms both
within and outside of a disorder's diagnostic criteria as measured by
intensity, duration, or number of symptoms, along with other features
such as type and severity of disabilities) rather than relying on a
simple yes-or-no approach. For diagnoses for which all symptoms are
needed for a diagnosis (a monothetic criteria set), different severity
levels of the constituent symptoms may be noted. If a threshold
endorsement of multiple symptoms is needed, such as at least five of
nine symptoms for major depressive disorder (a polythetic criteria set),
both severity levels and different combinations of the criteria may
identify more homogeneous diagnostic groups.

A dimensional approach depending primarily on an individual's subjective
reports of symptom experiences along with the clinician's interpretation
is consistent with current diagnostic practice. It is expected that as
our understanding of basic disease mechanisms based on pathophysiology,
neurocircuitry, gene-environment interactions, and laboratory tests
increases, approaches that integrate both objective and subjective
patient data will be developed to supplement and enhance the accuracy of
the diagnostic process.

*Cross-cutting symptom measures* modeled on general medicine's review of
systems can serve as an approach for reviewing critical
psychopathological domains. The general medical review of systems is
crucial to detecting subtle changes in different organ systems that can
facilitate diagnosis and treatment. A similar review of various mental
functions can aid in a more comprehensive mental status assessment by
drawing attention to symptoms that may not fit neatly into the
diagnostic criteria suggested by the individual's presenting symptoms,
but may nonetheless be important to the individual's care. The
cross-cutting measures have two levels: Level 1 questions are a brief
survey of 13 symptom domains for adult patients and 12 domains for child
and adolescent patients. Level 2 questions provide a more in-depth
assessment of certain domains. These measures were developed to be
administered both at initial interview and over time to track the
patient's symptom status and response to treatment.

*Severity measures* are disorder-specific, corresponding closely to the
criteria that constitute the disorder definition. They may be
administered to individuals who have received a diagnosis or who have a
clinically significant syndrome that falls short of meeting full
criteria for a diagnosis. Some of the assessments are self-completed by
the individual, while others require a clinician to complete. As with
the cross-cutting symptom measures, these measures were developed to be
administered both at initial interview and over time to track the
severity of the individual's disorder and response to treatment.

Assessment Measures

*The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule*, Version
2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) was developed to assess a patient's ability to perform
activities in six areas: understanding and communicating; getting
around; self-care; getting along with people; life activities (e.g.,
household, work/school); and participation in society. The scale is
self-administered and was developed to be used in patients with any
medical disorder. It corresponds to concepts contained in the WHO
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. This
assessment can also be used over time to track changes in a patient's
disabilities.

This chapter focuses on the DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure
(adult self-rated and parent/guardian versions); the Clinician-Rated
Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity; and the WHODAS 2.0. Clinician
instructions, scoring information, and interpretation guidelines are
included for each. These measures and additional dimensional
assessments, including those for diagnostic severity, can be found
online at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures

Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure

The DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure is a patient-or
informant-rated measure that assesses mental health domains that are
important across psychiatric diagnoses.

It is intended to help clinicians identify additional areas of inquiry
that may have significant impact on the individual's treatment and
prognosis. In addition, the measure may be used to track changes in the
individual's symptom presentation over time.

The adult version of the measure consists of 23 questions that assess 13
psychiatric domains, including depression, anger, mania, anxiety,
somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory,
repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality
functioning, and substance use (Table 1). Each domain consists of one to
three questions. Each item inquires about how much (or how often) the
individual has been bothered by the specific symptom during the past 2
weeks. If the individual is of impaired capacity and unable to complete
the form (e.g., an individual with dementia), a knowledgeable adult
informant may complete this measure. The measure was found to be
clinically useful and to have good reliability in the DSM-5 field trials
that were conducted in adult clinical samples across the United States
and in Canada.

The parent/guardian-rated version of the measure (for children ages
6--17) consists of 25 questions that assess 12 psychiatric domains,
including depression, anger, irritability, mania, anxiety, somatic
symptoms, inattention, suicidal ideation/attempt, psychosis, sleep
disturbance, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, and substance use (Table
2). Each item asks the parent or guardian to rate how much (or how
often) his or her child has been bothered by the specific psychiatric
symptom during the past 2 weeks. The measure was also found to be
clinically useful and to have good reliability in the DSM-5 field trials
that were conducted in pediatric clinical samples across the United
States. For children ages 11--17, along with the parent/guardian rating
of the child's symptoms, the clinician may consider having the child
complete the childrated version of the measure. The childrated version
of the measure can be found online at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

Scoring and interpretation.

On the adult self-rated version of the measure, each item is rated on a
5-point scale (0=none or not at all; 1=slight or rare, less than a day
or two; 2=mild or several days; 3=moderate or more than half the days;
and 4=severe or nearly every day).

The score on each item within a domain should be reviewed. However, a
rating of mild (i.e., 2) or greater on any item within a domain, except
for substance use, suicidal ideation, and psychosis, may serve as a
guide for additional inquiry and follow-up to determine if a more
detailed assessment is necessary, which may include the Level 2
cross-cutting symptom assessment for the domain (see Table 1). For
substance use, suicidal ideation, and psychosis, a

rating of slight (i.e., 1) or greater on any item within the domain may
serve as a guide for additional inquiry and follow-up to determine if a
more detailed assessment is needed. As such, indicate the highest score
within a domain in the "Highest domain score" column.

Table 1 outlines threshold scores that may guide further inquiry for the
remaining domains.

On the parent/guardian-rated version of the measure (for children ages
6--17), 19 of the 25

items are each rated on a 5-point scale (0=none or not at all; 1=slight
or rare, less than a day or two; 2=mild or several days; 3=moderate or
more than half the days; and 4=severe or nearly every day). The suicidal
ideation, suicide attempt, and substance abuse items are each rated on a
"Yes, No, or Don't Know" scale. The score on each item within a domain
should be reviewed. However, with the exception of inattention and
psychosis, a rating of mild (i.e., 2) or greater on any item within a
domain that is scored on the 5-point scale may serve as a guide for
additional inquiry and follow-up to determine if a more detailed
assessment is necessary, which may include the Level 2 cross-cutting
symptom assessment for the domain (see Table 2). For inattention or
psychosis, a rating of slight or greater (i.e., 1 or greater) may be

used as an indicator for additional inquiry. A parent or guardian's
rating of "Don't Know" on the suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and
any of the substance use items, especially for children ages 11--17
years, may result in additional probing of the issues with the child,
including using the childrated Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure for
the relevant domain. Because additional inquiry is made on the basis of
the highest score on any item within a domain, clinicians should
indicate that score in the "Highest Domain Score" column. Table 2

outlines threshold scores that may guide further inquiry for the
remaining domains.

Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures

Any threshold scores on the Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure (as
noted in Tables 1 and 2 and described in "Scoring and Interpretation"
indicate a possible need for detailed clinical inquiry. Level 2
Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures provide one method of obtaining more
in-depth information on potentially significant symptoms to inform
diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up. They are available online
at www.psychiatry.org/

dsm5. Tables 1 and 2 outline each Level 1 domain and identify the
domains for which DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures are
available for more detailed assessments. Adult and pediatric (parent and
child) versions are available online for most Level 1 symptom domains at
www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

Frequency of Use of the Cross-Cutting

Symptom Measures

To track change in the individual's symptom presentation over time, the
Level 1 and relevant Level 2 cross-cutting symptom measures may be
completed at regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the
stability of the individual's symptoms and treatment status. For
individuals with impaired capacity and for children ages 6--17 years, it
is preferable for the measures to be completed at follow-up appointments
by the same knowledgeable informant and by the same parent or guardian.
Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant
and problematic symptoms for the individual that might warrant further
assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Clinical judgment should guide
decision making.

Assessment Measures

Clinician-Rated Dimensions of

Psychosis Symptom Severity

As described in the chapter "Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic
Disorders,"

psychotic disorders are heterogeneous, and symptom severity can predict
important aspects of the illness, such as the degree of cognitive and/or
neurobiological deficits. Dimensional assessments capture meaningful
variation in the severity of symptoms, which may help with treatment
planning, prognostic decision-making, and research on pathophysiological
mechanisms. The Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity
provides scales for the dimensional assessment of the primary symptoms
of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech,
abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. A scale for the
dimensional assessment of cognitive impairment is also included. Many
individuals with psychotic disorders have impairments in a range of
cognitive domains, which predict functional abilities. In addition,
scales for dimensional assessment of depression and mania are provided,
which may alert clinicians to mood pathology. The severity of mood
symptoms in psychosis has prognostic value and guides treatment.

The Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity is an
8-item measure that may be completed by the clinician at the time of the
clinical assessment. Each item asks the clinician to rate the severity
of each symptom as experienced by the individual during the past 7 days.

Scoring and Interpretation

Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=none;
1=equivocal; 2=present, but mild; 3=present and moderate; and 4=present
and severe) with a symptom-specific definition of each rating level. The
clinician may review all of the individual's available information and,
based on clinical judgment, select (with checkmark) the level that most
accurately describes the severity of the individual's condition. The
clinician then indicates the score for each item in the "Score" column
provided.

Frequency of Use

To track changes in the individual's symptom severity over time, the
measure may be completed at regular intervals as clinically indicated,
depending on the stability of the individual's symptoms and treatment
status. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate
significant and problematic areas for the individual that might warrant
further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Clinical judgment should
guide decision making.

World Health Organization

Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0

The adult self-administered version of the World Health Organization
Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) is a 36-item measure
that assesses disability in adults age 18

years and older. It assesses disability across six domains, including
understanding and communicating, getting around, self-care, getting
along with people, life activities (i.e., household, work, and/or school
activities), and participation in society. If the adult individual is of
impaired capacity and unable to complete the form (e.g., a patient with
dementia), a knowledgeable informant may complete the proxy-administered
version of the measure, which is available at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.
Each item on the self-administered version of the WHODAS 2.0 asks the
individual to rate how much difficulty he or she has had in specific
areas of functioning during the past 30 days.

WHODAS 2.0 Scoring Instructions Provided by WHO

WHODAS 2.0 summary scores.

There are two basic options for computing the summary scores for the
WHODAS 2.0 36-item full version.

**Simple:** The scores assigned to each of the items---"none" (1),
"mild" (2), "moderate" (3),

"severe" (4), and "extreme" (5)---are summed. This method is referred to
as simple scoring because the scores from each of the items are simply
added up without recoding or collapsing of response categories; thus,
there is no weighting of individual items. This approach is practical to
use as a hand-scoring approach, and may be the method of choice in busy
clinical settings or in paper-and-pencil interview situations. As a
result, the simple sum of the scores of the items across all domains
constitutes a statistic that is sufficient to describe the degree of
functional limitations.

**Complex:** The more complex method of scoring is called
"item-response-theory"

(IRT)--based scoring. It takes into account multiple levels of
difficulty for each WHODAS

2.0 item. It takes the coding for each item response as "none," "mild,"
"moderate," "severe," and "extreme" separately, and then uses a computer
to determine the summary score by differentially weighting the items and
the levels of severity. The computer program is available from the WHO
Web site. The scoring has three steps:

• Step 1---Summing of recoded item scores within each domain.

• Step 2---Summing of all six domain scores.

• Step 3---Converting the summary score into a metric ranging from 0 to
100

(where 0=no disability; 100=full disability).

WHODAS 2.0 domain scores.

WHODAS 2.0 produces domain-specific scores for six

different functioning domains: cognition, mobility, self-care, getting
along, life activities (household and work/school), and participation.

WHODAS 2.0 population norms.

For the population norms for IRT-based scoring of the WHODAS 2.0 and for
the population distribution of IRT-based scores for WHODAS 2.0, please
see www.who.int/classifications/icf/Pop_norms_distrib_IRT_scores.pdf.

Additional Scoring and Interpretation Guidance for

DSM-5 Users

The clinician is asked to review the individual's response on each item
on the measure during the clinical interview and to indicate the
self-reported score for each item in the section provided for "Clinician
Use Only." However, if the clinician determines that the score on an
item should be different based on the clinical interview and other
information avail-

[]{#index_split_074.html#p791}**746**

Assessment Measures

able, he or she may indicate a corrected score in the raw item score
box. Based on findings from the DSM-5 Field Trials in adult patient
samples across six sites in the United States and one in Canada, *DSM-5
recommends calculation and use of average scores for each domain* *and
for general disability.* The average scores are comparable to the WHODAS
5-point scale, which allows the clinician to think of the individual's
disability in terms of none (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or
extreme (5). The average domain and general disability scores were found
to be reliable, easy to use, and clinically useful to the clinicians in
the DSM-5 Field Trials. The *average domain score* is calculated by
dividing the raw domain score by the number of items in the domain
(e.g., if all the items within the "understanding and communicating"
domain are rated as being moderate then the average domain score would
be 18/6=3, indicating moderate disability). The *average general
disability score* is calculated by dividing the raw overall score by
number of items in the measure (i.e., 36). The individual should be
encouraged to complete all of the items on the WHODAS 2.0. If no
response is given on 10 or more items of the measure (i.e., more than

[]{#index_split_083.html#p794}**Cultural**

**Formulation**

Understanding the cultural context of illness experience is essential
for effective diagnostic assessment and clinical management. *Culture*
refers to systems of knowledge, concepts, rules, and practices that are
learned and transmitted across generations.

Culture includes language, religion and spirituality, family structures,
life-cycle stages, ceremonial rituals, and customs, as well as moral and
legal systems. Cultures are open, dynamic systems that undergo
continuous change over time; in the contemporary world, most individuals
and groups are exposed to multiple cultures, which they use to fashion
their own identities and make sense of experience. These features of
culture make it crucial not to overgeneralize cultural information or
stereotype groups in terms of fixed cultural traits.

*Race* is a culturally constructed category of identity that divides
humanity into groups based on a variety of superficial physical traits
attributed to some hypothetical intrinsic, biological characteristics.
Racial categories and constructs have varied widely over history and
across societies. The construct of race has no consistent biological
definition, but it is socially important because it supports racial
ideologies, racism, discrimination, and social exclusion, which can have
strong negative effects on mental health. There is evidence that racism
can exacerbate many psychiatric disorders, contributing to poor outcome,
and that racial biases can affect diagnostic assessment.

*Ethnicity* is a culturally constructed group identity used to define
peoples and communities. It may be rooted in a common history,
geography, language, religion, or other shared characteristics of a
group, which distinguish that group from others. Ethnicity may be
self-assigned or attributed by outsiders. Increasing mobility,
intermarriage, and intermixing of cultures has defined new mixed,
multiple, or hybrid ethnic identities.

Culture, race, and ethnicity are related to economic inequities, racism,
and discrimination that result in health disparities. Cultural, ethnic,
and racial identities can be sources of strength and group support that
enhance resilience, but they may also lead to psychological,
interpersonal, and intergenerational conflict or difficulties in
adaptation that require diagnostic assessment.

Outline for Cultural Formulation

The Outline for Cultural Formulation introduced in DSM-IV provided a
framework for assessing information about cultural features of an
individual's mental health problem and how it relates to a social and
cultural context and history. DSM-5 not only includes an updated version
of the Outline but also presents an approach to assessment, using the
Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI), which has been field-tested for
diagnostic usefulness among clinicians and for acceptability among
patients.

The revised Outline for Cultural Formulation calls for systematic
assessment of the following categories:

• **Cultural identity of the individual:** Describe the individual's
racial, ethnic, or cultural reference groups that may influence his or
her relationships with others, access to re-749

[]{#index_split_083.html#p795}**750**

Cultural Formulation

sources, and developmental and current challenges, conflicts, or
predicaments. For immigrants and racial or ethnic minorities, the degree
and kinds of involvement with both the culture of origin and the host
culture or majority culture should be noted separately.

Language abilities, preferences, and patterns of use are relevant for
identifying difficulties with access to care, social integration, and
the need for an interpreter. Other clinically relevant aspects of
identity may include religious affiliation, socioeconomic background,
personal and family places of birth and growing up, migrant status, and
sexual orientation.

• **Cultural conceptualizations of distress:** Describe the cultural
constructs that influence how the individual experiences, understands,
and communicates his or her symptoms or problems to others. These
constructs may include cultural syndromes, idioms of distress, and
explanatory models or perceived causes. The level of severity and
meaning of the distressing experiences should be assessed in relation to
the norms of the individual's cultural reference groups. Assessment of
coping and help-seeking patterns should consider the use of professional
as well as traditional, alternative, or complementary sources of care.

• **Psychosocial stressors and cultural features of vulnerability and
resilience:** Identify key stressors and supports in the individual's
social environment (which may include both local and distant events) and
the role of religion, family, and other social networks (e.g., friends,
neighbors, coworkers) in providing emotional, instrumental, and
informational support. Social stressors and social supports vary with
cultural interpretations of events, family structure, developmental
tasks, and social context. Levels of functioning, disability, and
resilience should be assessed in light of the individual's cultural
reference groups.

• **Cultural features of the relationship between the individual and the
clinician:** Identify differences in culture, language, and social
status between an individual and clinician that may cause difficulties
in communication and may influence diagnosis and treatment. Experiences
of racism and discrimination in the larger society may impede
establishing trust and safety in the clinical diagnostic encounter.
Effects may include problems eliciting symptoms, misunderstanding of the
cultural and clinical significance of symptoms and behaviors, and
difficulty establishing or maintaining the rapport needed for an
effective clinical alliance.

• **Overall cultural assessment:** Summarize the implications of the
components of the cultural formulation identified in earlier sections of
the Outline for diagnosis and other clinically relevant issues or
problems as well as appropriate management and treatment intervention.

Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI)

The Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) is a set of 16 questions that
clinicians may use to obtain information during a mental health
assessment about the impact of culture on key aspects of an individual's
clinical presentation and care. In the CFI, *culture* refers to

• The values, orientations, knowledge, and practices that individuals
derive from membership in diverse social groups (e.g., ethnic groups,
faith communities, occupational groups, veterans groups).

• Aspects of an individual's background, developmental experiences, and
current social contexts that may affect his or her perspective, such as
geographical origin, migration, language, religion, sexual orientation,
or race/ethnicity.

• The influence of family, friends, and other community members (the
individual's *social* *network*) on the individual's illness experience.

[]{#index_split_083.html#p796}Cultural Formulation

**751**

The CFI is a brief semistructured interview for systematically assessing
cultural factors in the clinical encounter that may be used with any
individual. The CFI focuses on the individual's experience and the
social contexts of the clinical problem. The CFI follows a
person-centered approach to cultural assessment by eliciting information
from the individual about his or her own views and those of others in
his or her social network. This approach is designed to avoid
stereotyping, in that each individual's cultural knowledge affects how
he or she interprets illness experience and guides how he or she seeks
help. Because the CFI concerns the individual's personal views, there
are no right or wrong answers to these questions. The interview follows
and is available online at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

The CFI is formatted as two text columns. The left-hand column contains
the instructions for administering the CFI and describes the goals for
each interview domain. The questions in the right-hand column illustrate
how to explore these domains, but they are not meant to be exhaustive.
Follow-up questions may be needed to clarify individuals' answers.
Questions may be rephrased as needed. The CFI is intended as a guide to
cultural assessment and should be used flexibly to maintain a natural
flow of the interview and rapport with the individual.

The CFI is best used in conjunction with demographic information
obtained prior to the interview in order to tailor the CFI questions to
address the individual's background and current situation. Specific
demographic domains to be explored with the CFI will vary across
individuals and settings. A comprehensive assessment may include place
of birth, age, gender, racial/ethnic origin, marital status, family
composition, education, language fluencies, sexual orientation,
religious or spiritual affiliation, occupation, employment, income, and
migration history.

The CFI can be used in the initial assessment of individuals in all
clinical settings, regardless of the cultural background of the
individual or of the clinician. Individuals and clinicians who appear to
share the same cultural background may nevertheless differ in ways that
are relevant to care. The CFI may be used in its entirety, or components
may be incorporated into a clinical evaluation as needed. The CFI may be
especially helpful when there is • Difficulty in diagnostic assessment
owing to significant differences in the cultural, religious, or
socioeconomic backgrounds of clinician and the individual.

• Uncertainty about the fit between culturally distinctive symptoms and
diagnostic criteria.

• Difficulty in judging illness severity or impairment.

• Disagreement between the individual and clinician on the course of
care.

• Limited engagement in and adherence to treatment by the individual.

The CFI emphasizes four domains of assessment: Cultural Definition of
the Problem (questions 1--3); Cultural Perceptions of Cause, Context,
and Support (questions 4--10); Cultural Factors Affecting Self-Coping
and Past Help Seeking (questions 11--13); and Cultural Factors Affecting
Current Help Seeking (questions 14--16). Both the person-centered
process of conducting the CFI and the information it elicits are
intended to enhance the cultural validity of diagnostic assessment,
facilitate treatment planning, and promote the individual's engagement
and satisfaction. To achieve these goals, the information obtained from
the CFI should be integrated with all other available clinical material
into a comprehensive clinical and contextual evaluation. An Informant
version of the CFI can be used to collect collateral information on the
CFI domains from family members or caregivers.

Supplementary modules have been developed that expand on each domain of
the CFI and guide clinicians who wish to explore these domains in
greater depth. Supplementary modules have also been developed for
specific populations, such as children and adolescents, elderly
individuals, and immigrants and refugees. These supplementary modules
are referenced in the CFI under the pertinent subheadings and are
available online at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI)---Informant Version The
CFI--Informant Version collects collateral information from an informant
who is knowledgeable about the clinical problems and life circumstances
of the identified individual. This version can be used to supplement
information obtained from the core CFI or can be used instead of the
core CFI when the individual is unable to provide information---

as might occur, for example, with children or adolescents, floridly
psychotic individuals, or persons with cognitive impairment.

Cultural Formulation

Cultural Concepts of Distress

*Cultural concepts of distress* refers to ways that cultural groups
experience, understand, and communicate suffering, behavioral problems,
or troubling thoughts and emotions. Three main types of cultural
concepts may be distinguished. *Cultural syndromes* are clusters of
symptoms and attributions that tend to co-occur among individuals in
specific cultural groups, communities, or contexts and that are
recognized locally as coherent patterns of experience. *Cultural idioms
of distress* are ways of expressing distress that may not involve
specific symptoms or syndromes, but that provide collective, shared ways
of experiencing and talking about personal or social concerns. For
example, everyday talk about "nerves"

or "depression" may refer to widely varying forms of suffering without
mapping onto a discrete set of symptoms, syndrome, or disorder.
*Cultural explanations* or *perceived causes* are labels, attributions,
or features of an explanatory model that indicate culturally recognized
meaning or etiology for symptoms, illness, or distress.

These three concepts---syndromes, idioms, and explanations---are more
relevant to clinical practice than the older formulation *culture-bound
syndrome.* Specifically, the term *culture-bound syndrome* ignores the
fact that clinically important cultural differences often involve
explanations or experience of distress rather than culturally
distinctive configurations of symptoms. Furthermore, the term
*culture-bound* overemphasizes the local particularity and limited
distribution of cultural concepts of distress. The current formulation
acknowledges that *all* forms of distress are locally shaped, including
the DSM disorders.

From this perspective, many DSM diagnoses can be understood as
operationalized prototypes that started out as cultural syndromes, and
became widely accepted as a result of their clinical and research
utility. Across groups there remain culturally patterned differences in
symptoms, ways of talking about distress, and locally perceived causes,
which are in turn associated with coping strategies and patterns of help
seeking.

Cultural concepts arise from local folk or professional diagnostic
systems for mental and emotional distress, and they may also reflect the
influence of biomedical concepts.

Cultural concepts have four key features in relation to the DSM-5
nosology:

• There is seldom a one-to-one correspondence of any cultural concept
with a DSM diagnostic entity; the correspondence is more likely to be
one-to-many in either direction.

Symptoms or behaviors that might be sorted by DSM-5 into several
disorders may be included in a single folk concept, and diverse
presentations that might be classified by DSM-5 as variants of a single
disorder may be sorted into several distinct concepts by an indigenous
diagnostic system.

• Cultural concepts may apply to a wide range of severity, including
presentations that do not meet DSM criteria for any mental disorder. For
example, an individual with acute grief or a social predicament may use
the same idiom of distress or display the same cultural syndrome as
another individual with more severe psychopathology.

• In common usage, the same cultural term frequently denotes more than
one type of cultural concept. A familiar example may be the concept of
"depression," which may be used to describe a syndrome (e.g., major
depressive disorder), an idiom of distress (e.g., as in the common
expression "I feel depressed"), or a perceived cause (similar to

"stress").

• Like culture and DSM itself, cultural concepts may change over time in
response to both local and global influences.

Cultural concepts are important to psychiatric diagnosis for several
reasons:

• **To avoid misdiagnosis:** Cultural variation in symptoms and in
explanatory models associated with these cultural concepts may lead
clinicians to misjudge the severity of a

[]{#index_split_110.html#p804}Cultural Formulation

**759**

problem or assign the wrong diagnosis (e.g., unfamiliar spiritual
explanations may be misunderstood as psychosis).

• **To obtain useful clinical information:** Cultural variations in
symptoms and attributions may be associated with particular features of
risk, resilience, and outcome.

• **To improve clinical rapport and engagement:** "Speaking the language
of the patient,"

both linguistically and in terms of his or her dominant concepts and
metaphors, can result in greater communication and satisfaction,
facilitate treatment negotiation, and lead to higher retention and
adherence.

• **To improve therapeutic efficacy:** Culture influences the
psychological mechanisms of disorder, which need to be understood and
addressed to improve clinical efficacy. For example, culturally specific
catastrophic cognitions can contribute to symptom escalation into panic
attacks.

• **To guide clinical research:** Locally perceived connections between
cultural concepts may help identify patterns of comorbidity and
underlying biological substrates.

• **To clarify the cultural epidemiology:** Cultural concepts of
distress are not endorsed uniformly by everyone in a given culture.
Distinguishing syndromes, idioms, and explanations provides an approach
for studying the distribution of cultural features of illness across
settings and regions, and over time. It also suggests questions about
cultural determinants of risk, course, and outcome in clinical and
community settings to enhance the evidence base of cultural research.

DSM-5 includes information on cultural concepts in order to improve the
accuracy of diagnosis and the comprehensiveness of clinical assessment.
Clinical assessment of individuals presenting with these cultural
concepts should determine whether they meet DSM-5 criteria for a
specified disorder or an *other specified or unspecified* diagnosis.
Once the disorder is diagnosed, the cultural terms and explanations
should be included in case formulations; they may help clarify symptoms
and etiological attributions that could otherwise be confusing.
Individuals whose symptoms do not meet DSM criteria for a specific
mental disorder may still expect and require treatment; this should be
assessed on a case-by-case basis. In addition to the CFI and its
supplementary modules, DSM-5 contains the following information and
tools that may be useful when integrating cultural information in
clinical practice: • **Data in DSM-5 criteria and text for specific
disorders:** The text includes information on cultural variations in
prevalence, symptomatology, associated cultural concepts, and other
clinical aspects. It is important to emphasize that there is no
one-to-one correspondence at the categorical level between DSM disorders
and cultural concepts. Differential diagnosis for individuals must
therefore incorporate information on cultural variation with information
elicited by the CFI.

• **Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention:** Some
of the clinical concerns identified by the CFI may correspond to V codes
or Z codes---for example, acculturation problems, parent-child
relational problems, or religious or spiritual problems.

• **Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress:** Located in the
Appendix, this glossary provides examples of well-studied cultural
concepts of distress that illustrate the relevance of cultural
information for clinical diagnosis and some of the interrelationships
among cultural syndromes, idioms of distress, and causal explanations.

[]{#index_split_110.html#p806}**Alternative DSM-5 Model for**

**Personality Disorders**

The current approach to personality disorders appears in Section II of
DSM-5, and an alternative model developed for DSM-5 is presented here in
Section III. The inclusion of both models in DSM-5 reflects the decision
of the APA Board of Trustees to preserve continuity with current
clinical practice, while also introducing a new approach that aims to
address numerous shortcomings of the current approach to personality
disorders.

For example, the typical patient meeting criteria for a specific
personality disorder frequently also meets criteria for other
personality disorders. Similarly, other specified or unspecified
personality disorder is often the correct (but mostly uninformative)
diagnosis, in the sense that patients do not tend to present with
patterns of symptoms that correspond with one and only one personality
disorder.

In the following alternative DSM-5 model, personality disorders are
characterized by impairments in personality *functioning* and
pathological personality *traits.* The specific personality disorder
diagnoses that may be derived from this model include antisocial,
avoidant, borderline, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, and
schizotypal personality disorders. This approach also includes a
diagnosis of personality disorder---trait specified (PD-TS) that can be
made when a personality disorder is considered present but the criteria
for a specific disorder are not met.

General Criteria for Personality Disorder

General Criteria for Personality Disorder

The essential features of a personality disorder are

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality (self/interpersonal)
functioning.

B. One or more pathological personality traits.

C. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's
personality trait expression are relatively inflexible and pervasive
across a broad range of personal and social situations.

D. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's
personality trait expression are relatively stable across time, with
onsets that can be traced back to at least adolescence or early
adulthood.

E. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's
personality trait expression are not better explained by another mental
disorder.

F. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's
personality trait expression are not solely attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition (e.g.,
severe head trauma).

G. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's
personality trait expression are not better understood as normal for an
individual's developmental stage or sociocultural environment.

**761**

[]{#index_split_110.html#p807}**762**

Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders

A diagnosis of a personality disorder requires two determinations: 1) an
assessment of the level of impairment in personality functioning, which
is needed for Criterion A, and 2) an evaluation of pathological
personality traits, which is required for Criterion B. The impairments
in personality functioning and personality trait expression are
relatively inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and
social situations (Criterion C); relatively stable across time, with
onsets that can be traced back to at least adolescence or early
adulthood (Criterion D); not better explained by another mental disorder
(Criterion E); not attributable to the effects of a substance or another
medical condition (Criterion F); and not better understood as normal for
an individual's developmental stage or sociocultural environment
(Criterion G). All Section III personality disorders described by
criteria sets, as well as PD-TS, meet these general criteria, by
definition.

Criterion A: Level of Personality Functioning

Disturbances in **self** and **interpersonal** functioning constitute
the core of personality psychopathology and in this alternative
diagnostic model they are evaluated on a continuum.

Self functioning involves identity and self-direction; interpersonal
functioning involves empathy and intimacy (see Table 1). The Level of
Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS; see Table 2, pp. 775--778) uses
each of these elements to differentiate five levels of impairment,
ranging from little or no impairment (i.e., healthy, adaptive
functioning; Level 0) to some (Level 1), moderate (Level 2), severe
(Level 3), and extreme (Level 4) impairment.

**TABLE 1**

**Elements of personality functioning**

Self:

1\. ***Identity:*** Experience of oneself as unique, with clear
boundaries between self and others; stability of self-esteem and
accuracy of self-appraisal; capacity for, and ability to regulate, a
range of emotional experience.

2\. ***Self-direction:*** Pursuit of coherent and meaningful short-term
and life goals; utilization of constructive and prosocial internal
standards of behavior; ability to self-reflect productively.

Interpersonal:

1\.

***Empathy:*** Comprehension and appreciation of others' experiences and
motivations; tolerance of differing perspectives; understanding the
effects of one's own behavior on others.

2\. ***Intimacy:*** Depth and duration of connection with others; desire
and capacity for closeness; mutuality of regard reflected in
interpersonal behavior.

Impairment in personality functioning predicts the presence of a
personality disorder, and the severity of impairment predicts whether an
individual has more than one personality disorder or one of the more
typically severe personality disorders. A moderate level of impairment
in personality functioning is required for the diagnosis of a
personality disorder; this threshold is based on empirical evidence that
the moderate level of impairment maximizes the ability of clinicians to
accurately and efficiently identify personality disorder pathology.

Criterion B: Pathological Personality Traits

Pathological personality traits are organized into five broad domains:
Negative Affectivity, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition, and
Psychoticism. Within the five broad **trait** **domains** are 25
specific **trait facets** that were developed initially from a review of
existing trait models and subsequently through iterative research with
samples of persons who sought mental health services. The full trait
taxonomy is presented in Table 3 (see pp. 779-- 781). The B criteria for
the specific personality disorders comprise subsets of the 25 trait

[]{#index_split_110.html#p808}Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality
Disorders **763**

facets, based on meta-analytic reviews and empirical data on the
relationships of the traits to DSM-IV personality disorder diagnoses.

Criteria C and D: Pervasiveness and Stability

Impairments in personality functioning and pathological personality
traits are *relatively* pervasive across a range of personal and social
contexts, as personality is defined as a pattern of perceiving, relating
to, and thinking about the environment and oneself. The term
*relatively* reflects the fact that all except the most extremely
pathological personalities show some degree of adaptability. The pattern
in personality disorders is maladaptive and relatively inflexible, which
leads to disabilities in social, occupational, or other important
pursuits, as individuals are unable to modify their thinking or
behavior, even in the face of evidence that their approach is not
working. The impairments in functioning and personality traits are also
*relatively* stable. Personality traits---the dispositions to behave or
feel in certain ways---are more stable than the symptomatic expressions
of these dispositions, but personality traits can also change.
Impairments in personality functioning are more stable than symptoms.

Criteria E, F, and G: Alternative Explanations for

Personality Pathology (Differential Diagnosis)

On some occasions, what appears to be a personality disorder may be
better explained by another mental disorder, the effects of a substance
or another medical condition, or a normal developmental stage (e.g.,
adolescence, late life) or the individual's sociocultural environment.
When another mental disorder is present, the diagnosis of a personality
disorder is not made, if the manifestations of the personality disorder
clearly are an expression of the other mental disorder (e.g., if
features of schizotypal personality disorder are present only in the
context of schizophrenia). On the other hand, personality disorders can
be accurately diagnosed in the presence of another mental disorder, such
as major depressive disorder, and patients with other mental disorders
should be assessed for comorbid personality disorders because
personality disorders often impact the course of other mental disorders.
Therefore, it is always appropriate to assess personality functioning
and pathological personality traits to provide a context for other
psychopathology.

Specific Personality Disorders

Section III includes diagnostic criteria for antisocial, avoidant,
borderline, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal
personality disorders. Each personality disorder is defined by typical
impairments in personality functioning (Criterion A) and characteristic
pathological personality traits (Criterion B):

• Typical features of **antisocial personality disorder** are a failure
to conform to lawful and ethical behavior, and an egocentric, callous
lack of concern for others, accompanied by deceitfulness,
irresponsibility, manipulativeness, and/or risk taking.

• Typical features of **avoidant personality disorder** are avoidance of
social situations and inhibition in interpersonal relationships related
to feelings of ineptitude and inadequacy, anxious preoccupation with
negative evaluation and rejection, and fears of ridicule or
embarrassment.

Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders

• Typical features of **obsessive-compulsive personality disorder** are
difficulties in establishing and sustaining close relationships,
associated with rigid perfectionism, inflexibility, and restricted
emotional expression.

• Typical features of **schizotypal personality disorder** are
impairments in the capacity for social and close relationships, and
eccentricities in cognition, perception, and behavior that are
associated with distorted self-image and incoherent personal goals and
accompanied by suspiciousness and restricted emotional expression.

The A and B criteria for the six specific personality disorders and for
PD-TS follow. All personality disorders also meet criteria C through G
of the General Criteria for Personality Disorder.

Antisocial Personality Disorder

Typical features of antisocial personality disorder are a failure to
conform to lawful and ethical behavior, and an egocentric, callous lack
of concern for others, accompanied by deceitfulness, irresponsibility,
manipulativeness, and/or risk taking. Characteristic difficulties are
apparent in identity, self-direction, empathy, and/or intimacy, as
described below, along with specific maladaptive traits in the domains
of Antagonism and Disinhibition.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested
by characteristic difficulties in two or more of the following four
areas: 1. ***Identity:*** Egocentrism; self-esteem derived from personal
gain, power, or pleasure.

2\. ***Self-direction:*** Goal setting based on personal gratification;
absence of prosocial internal standards, associated with failure to
conform to lawful or culturally normative ethical behavior.

3\. ***Empathy:*** Lack of concern for feelings, needs, or suffering of
others; lack of remorse after hurting or mistreating another.

4\. ***Intimacy:*** Incapacity for mutually intimate relationships, as
exploitation is a primary means of relating to others, including by
deceit and coercion; use of dominance or intimidation to control others.

B. Six or more of the following seven pathological personality
traits: 1. ***Manipulativeness*** (an aspect of **Antagonism**):
Frequent use of subterfuge to influence or control others; use of
seduction, charm, glibness, or ingratiation to achieve one's ends.

2\. ***Callousness*** (an aspect of **Antagonism**): Lack of concern for
feelings or problems of others; lack of guilt or remorse about the
negative or harmful effects of one's actions on others; aggression;
sadism.

3\. ***Deceitfulness*** (an aspect of **Antagonism**): Dishonesty and
fraudulence; misrepresentation of self; embellishment or fabrication
when relating events.

4\. ***Hostility*** (an aspect of **Antagonism**): Persistent or
frequent angry feelings; anger or irritability in response to minor
slights and insults; mean, nasty, or vengeful behavior.

5\. ***Risk taking*** (an aspect of **Disinhibition**): Engagement in
dangerous, risky, and potentially self-damaging activities,
unnecessarily and without regard for consequences; boredom proneness and
thoughtless initiation of activities to counter boredom; lack of concern
for one's limitations and denial of the reality of personal danger.

6\. ***Impulsivity*** (an aspect of **Disinhibition**): Acting on the
spur of the moment in response to immediate stimuli; acting on a
momentary basis without a plan or consideration of outcomes; difficulty
establishing and following plans.

[]{#index_split_110.html#p810}Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality
Disorders **765**

7\. ***Irresponsibility*** (an aspect of **Disinhibition**): Disregard
for---and failure to honor---

financial and other obligations or commitments; lack of respect
for---and lack of follow-through on---agreements and promises.

**Note.** The individual is at least 18 years of age.

*Specify* if:

**With psychopathic features.**

Specifiers.

A distinct variant often termed *psychopathy* (or "primary" psychopathy)
is marked by a lack of anxiety or fear and by a bold interpersonal style
that may mask maladaptive behaviors (e.g., fraudulence). This
psychopathic variant is characterized by low levels of anxiousness
(Negative Affectivity domain) and withdrawal (Detachment domain) and
high levels of attention seeking (Antagonism domain). High attention
seeking and low withdrawal capture the social potency
(assertive/dominant) component of psychopathy, whereas low anxiousness
captures the stress immunity (emotional stability/resilience) component.

In addition to psychopathic features, trait and personality functioning
specifiers may be used to record other personality features that may be
present in antisocial personality disorder but are not required for the
diagnosis. For example, traits of Negative Affectivity (e.g.,
anxiousness), are not diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality
disorder (see Criterion B) but can be specified when appropriate.
Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment in personality
functioning is required for the diagnosis of antisocial personality
disorder (Criterion A), the level of personality functioning can also be
specified.

Avoidant Personality Disorder

Typical features of avoidant personality disorder are avoidance of
social situations and inhibition in interpersonal relationships related
to feelings of ineptitude and inadequacy, anxious preoccupation with
negative evaluation and rejection, and fears of ridicule or
embarrassment. Characteristic difficulties are apparent in identity,
self-direction, empathy, and/or intimacy, as described below, along with
specific maladaptive traits in the domains of Negative Affectivity and
Detachment.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifest
by characteristic difficulties in two or more of the following four
areas: 1. ***Identity:*** Low self-esteem associated with self-appraisal
as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior; excessive
feelings of shame.

2\. ***Self-direction:*** Unrealistic standards for behavior associated
with reluctance to pursue goals, take personal risks, or engage in new
activities involving interpersonal contact.

3\. ***Empathy:*** Preoccupation with, and sensitivity to, criticism or
rejection, associated with distorted inference of others' perspectives
as negative.

4\. ***Intimacy:*** Reluctance to get involved with people unless being
certain of being liked; diminished mutuality within intimate
relationships because of fear of being shamed or ridiculed.

B. Three or more of the following four pathological personality traits,
one of which must be (1) Anxiousness:

1\. ***Anxiousness*** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity**): Intense
feelings of nervousness, tenseness, or panic, often in reaction to
social situations; worry about the negative effects of past unpleasant
experiences and future negative possibilities;

[]{#index_split_110.html#p811}**766**

Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders

feeling fearful, apprehensive, or threatened by uncertainty; fears of
embarrassment.

2\. ***Withdrawal*** (an aspect of **Detachment**): Reticence in social
situations; avoidance of social contacts and activity; lack of
initiation of social contact.

3\. ***Anhedonia*** (an aspect of **Detachment**): Lack of enjoyment
from, engagement in, or energy for life's experiences; deficits in the
capacity to feel pleasure or take interest in things.

4\. ***Intimacy avoidance*** (an aspect of **Detachment**): Avoidance of
close or romantic relationships, interpersonal attachments, and intimate
sexual relationships.

Specifiers.

Considerable heterogeneity in the form of additional personality traits
is found among individuals diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder.
Trait and level of personality functioning specifiers can be used to
record additional personality features that may be present in avoidant
personality disorder. For example, other Negative Affectivity traits
(e.g., depressivity, separation insecurity, submissiveness,
suspiciousness, hostility) are not diagnostic criteria for avoidant
personality disorder (see Criterion B) but can be specified when
appropriate. Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning is required for the diagnosis of avoidant
personality disorder (Criterion A), the level of personality functioning
also can be specified.

Borderline Personality Disorder

Typical features of borderline personality disorder are instability of
self-image, personal goals, interpersonal relationships, and affects,
accompanied by impulsivity, risk taking, and/or hostility.
Characteristic difficulties are apparent in identity, self-direction,
empathy, and/or intimacy, as described below, along with specific
maladaptive traits in the domain of Negative Affectivity, and also
Antagonism and/or Disinhibition.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested
by characteristic difficulties in two or more of the following four
areas: 1. ***Identity:*** Markedly impoverished, poorly developed, or
unstable self-image, often associated with excessive self-criticism;
chronic feelings of emptiness; dissociative states under stress.

2\. ***Self-direction:*** Instability in goals, aspirations, values, or
career plans.

3\. ***Empathy:*** Compromised ability to recognize the feelings and
needs of others associated with interpersonal hypersensitivity (i.e.,
prone to feel slighted or insulted); perceptions of others selectively
biased toward negative attributes or vulnerabilities.

4\. ***Intimacy:*** Intense, unstable, and conflicted close
relationships, marked by mistrust, neediness, and anxious preoccupation
with real or imagined abandonment; close relationships often viewed in
extremes of idealization and devaluation and alternating between
overinvolvement and withdrawal.

B. Four or more of the following seven pathological personality traits,
at least one of which must be (5) Impulsivity, (6) Risk taking, or (7)
Hostility: 1. ***Emotional lability*** (an aspect of **Negative
Affectivity**): Unstable emotional experiences and frequent mood
changes; emotions that are easily aroused, intense, and/or out of
proportion to events and circumstances.

2\. ***Anxiousness*** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity**): Intense
feelings of nervousness, tenseness, or panic, often in reaction to
interpersonal stresses; worry about the negative effects of past
unpleasant experiences and future negative possibili-

Disorders **767**

ties; feeling fearful, apprehensive, or threatened by uncertainty; fears
of falling apart or losing control.

3\. ***Separation insecurity*** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity**):
Fears of rejection by---

and/or separation from---significant others, associated with fears of
excessive dependency and complete loss of autonomy.

4\. ***Depressivity*** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity**): Frequent
feelings of being down, miserable, and/or hopeless; difficulty
recovering from such moods; pessimism about the future; pervasive shame;
feelings of inferior self-worth; thoughts of suicide and suicidal
behavior.

5\. ***Impulsivity*** (an aspect of **Disinhibition**): Acting on the
spur of the moment in response to immediate stimuli; acting on a
momentary basis without a plan or consideration of outcomes; difficulty
establishing or following plans; a sense of urgency and self-harming
behavior under emotional distress.

6\. ***Risk taking*** (an aspect of **Disinhibition**): Engagement in
dangerous, risky, and potentially self-damaging activities,
unnecessarily and without regard to consequences; lack of concern for
one's limitations and denial of the reality of personal danger.

7\. ***Hostility*** (an aspect of **Antagonism**): Persistent or
frequent angry feelings; anger or irritability in response to minor
slights and insults.

Specifiers.

Trait and level of personality functioning specifiers may be used to
record additional personality features that may be present in borderline
personality disorder but are not required for the diagnosis. For
example, traits of Psychoticism (e.g., cognitive and perceptual
dysregulation) are not diagnostic criteria for borderline personality
disorder (see Criterion B) but can be specified when appropriate.
Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment in personality
functioning is required for the diagnosis of borderline personality
disorder (Criterion A), the level of personality functioning can also be
specified.

Narcissistic Personality Disorder

Typical features of narcissistic personality disorder are variable and
vulnerable self-esteem, with attempts at regulation through attention
and approval seeking, and either overt or covert grandiosity.
Characteristic difficulties are apparent in identity, self-direction,
empathy, and/or intimacy, as described below, along with specific
maladaptive traits in the domain of Antagonism.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested
by characteristic difficulties in two or more of the following four
areas: 1. ***Identity:*** Excessive reference to others for
self-definition and self-esteem regulation; exaggerated self-appraisal
inflated or deflated, or vacillating between extremes; emotional
regulation mirrors fluctuations in self-esteem.

2\. ***Self-direction:*** Goal setting based on gaining approval from
others; personal standards unreasonably high in order to see oneself as
exceptional, or too low based on a sense of entitlement; often unaware
of own motivations.

3\. ***Empathy:*** Impaired ability to recognize or identify with the
feelings and needs of others; excessively attuned to reactions of
others, but only if perceived as relevant to self; over-or underestimate
of own effect on others.

4\. ***Intimacy:*** Relationships largely superficial and exist to serve
self-esteem regulation; mutuality constrained by little genuine interest
in others' experiences and predominance of a need for personal gain.

[]{#index_split_110.html#p813}**768**

Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders

B. Both of the following pathological personality traits: 1.
***Grandiosity*** (an aspect of **Antagonism**): Feelings of
entitlement, either overt or covert; self-centeredness; firmly holding
to the belief that one is better than others; condescension toward
others.

2\. ***Attention seeking*** (an aspect of **Antagonism**): Excessive
attempts to attract and be the focus of the attention of others;
admiration seeking.

Specifiers.

Trait and personality functioning specifiers may be used to record
additional personality features that may be present in narcissistic
personality disorder but are not required for the diagnosis. For
example, other traits of Antagonism (e.g., manipulativeness,
deceitfulness, callousness) are not diagnostic criteria for narcissistic
personality disorder (see Criterion B) but can be specified when more
pervasive antagonistic features (e.g., "malignant narcissism") are
present. Other traits of Negative Affectivity (e.g., depressivity,
anxiousness) can be specified to record more "vulnerable" presentations.
Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment in personality
functioning is required for the diagnosis of narcissistic personality
disorder (Criterion A), the level of personality functioning can also be
specified.

Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder

Typical features of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are
difficulties in establishing and sustaining close relationships,
associated with rigid perfectionism, inflexibility, and restricted
emotional expression. Characteristic difficulties are apparent in
identity, self-direction, empathy, and/or intimacy, as described below,
along with specific maladaptive traits in the domains of Negative
Affectivity and/or Detachment.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested
by characteristic difficulties in two or more of the following four
areas: 1. ***Identity:*** Sense of self derived predominantly from work
or productivity; constricted experience and expression of strong
emotions.

2\. ***Self-direction:*** Difficulty completing tasks and realizing
goals, associated with rigid and unreasonably high and inflexible
internal standards of behavior; overly conscientious and moralistic
attitudes.

3\. ***Empathy:*** Difficulty understanding and appreciating the ideas,
feelings, or behaviors of others.

4\. ***Intimacy:*** Relationships seen as secondary to work and
productivity; rigidity and stubbornness negatively affect relationships
with others.

B. Three or more of the following four pathological personality traits,
one of which must be (1) Rigid perfectionism:

1\. ***Rigid perfectionism*** (an aspect of extreme Conscientiousness
\[the opposite pole of Disinhibition\]): Rigid insistence on everything
being flawless, perfect, and without errors or faults, including one's
own and others' performance; sacrificing of timeliness to ensure
correctness in every detail; believing that there is only one right way
to do things; difficulty changing ideas and/or viewpoint; preoccupation
with details, organization, and order.

2\. ***Perseveration*** (an aspect of **Negative Affectivity**):
Persistence at tasks long after the behavior has ceased to be functional
or effective; continuance of the same behavior despite repeated
failures.

3\. ***Intimacy avoidance*** (an aspect of **Detachment**): Avoidance of
close or romantic relationships, interpersonal attachments, and intimate
sexual relationships.

Disorders **769**

4\. ***Restricted affectivity*** (an aspect of **Detachment**): Little
reaction to emotionally arousing situations; constricted emotional
experience and expression; indifference or coldness.

Specifiers.

Trait and personality functioning specifiers may be used to record
additional personality features that may be present in
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder but are not required for the
diagnosis. For example, other traits of Negative Affectivity (e.g.,
anxiousness) are not diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder (see Criterion B) but can be specified when
appropriate. Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning is required for the diagnosis of
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (Criterion A), the level of
personality functioning can also be specified.

Schizotypal Personality Disorder

Typical features of schizotypal personality disorder are impairments in
the capacity for social and close relationships and eccentricities in
cognition, perception, and behavior that are associated with distorted
self-image and incoherent personal goals and accompanied by
suspiciousness and restricted emotional expression. Characteristic
difficulties are apparent in identity, self-direction, empathy, and/or
intimacy, along with specific maladaptive traits in the domains of
Psychoticism and Detachment.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested
by characteristic difficulties in two or more of the following four
areas: 1. ***Identity:*** Confused boundaries between self and others;
distorted self-concept; emotional expression often not congruent with
context or internal experience.

2\. ***Self-direction:*** Unrealistic or incoherent goals; no clear set
of internal standards.

Specifiers.

Trait and personality functioning specifiers may be used to record
additional personality features that may be present in schizotypal
personality disorder but are not required for the diagnosis. For
example, traits of Negative Affectivity (e.g., depressivity,
anxiousness) are not diagnostic criteria for schizotypal personality
disorder (see Criterion B) but can be specified when appropriate.
Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment in personality
functioning is required for the diagnosis of schizotypal personality
disorder (Criterion A), the level of personality functioning can also be

Personality Disorder---Trait Specified

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria

A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested
by difficulties in two or more of the following four areas:

1\. ***Identity***

2\. ***Self-direction***

3\. ***Empathy***

4\. ***Intimacy***

B. One or more pathological personality trait domains OR specific trait
facets within domains, considering ALL of the following domains:

1\. **Negative Affectivity** (vs. Emotional Stability): Frequent and
intense experiences of high levels of a wide range of negative emotions
(e.g., anxiety, depression, guilt/

shame, worry, anger), and their behavioral (e.g., self-harm) and
interpersonal (e.g., dependency) manifestations.

2\. **Detachment** (vs. Extraversion): Avoidance of socioemotional
experience, including both withdrawal from interpersonal interactions,
ranging from casual, daily interactions to friendships to intimate
relationships, as well as restricted affective experience and
expression, particularly limited hedonic capacity.

3\. **Antagonism** (vs. Agreeableness): Behaviors that put the
individual at odds with other people, including an exaggerated sense of
self-importance and a concomitant expectation of special treatment, as
well as a callous antipathy toward others, encompassing both unawareness
of others' needs and feelings, and a readiness to use others in the
service of self-enhancement.

4\. **Disinhibition** (vs. Conscientiousness): Orientation toward
immediate gratification, leading to impulsive behavior driven by current
thoughts, feelings, and external stimuli, without regard for past
learning or consideration of future consequences.

5\. **Psychoticism** (vs. Lucidity): Exhibiting a wide range of
culturally incongruent odd, eccentric, or unusual behaviors and
cognitions, including both process (e.g., perception, dissociation) and
content (e.g., beliefs).

Subtypes.

Because personality features vary continuously along multiple trait
dimensions, a comprehensive set of potential expressions of PD-TS can be
represented by DSM5's dimensional model of maladaptive personality trait
variants (see Table 3, pp. 779--781).

Thus, subtypes are unnecessary for PD-TS, and instead, the descriptive
elements that constitute personality are provided, arranged in an
empirically based model. This arrangement allows clinicians to tailor
the description of each individual's personality disorder profile,
considering all five broad domains of personality trait variation and
drawing on the descriptive features of these domains as needed to
characterize the individual.

[]{#index_split_110.html#p816}Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality
Disorders **771**

Specifiers.

The specific personality features of individuals are always recorded in
evaluating Criterion B, so the combination of personality features
characterizing an individual directly constitutes the specifiers in each
case. For example, two individuals who are both characterized by
emotional lability, hostility, and depressivity may differ such that the
first individual is characterized additionally by callousness, whereas
the second is not.

Personality Disorder Scoring Algorithms

The requirement for any two of the four A criteria for each of the six
personality disorders was based on maximizing the relationship of these
criteria to their corresponding personality disorder. Diagnostic
thresholds for the B criteria were also set empirically to minimize
change in prevalence of the disorders from DSM-IV and overlap with other
personality disorders, and to maximize relationships with functional
impairment. The resulting diagnostic criteria sets represent clinically
useful personality disorders with high fidelity, in terms of core
impairments in personality functioning of varying degrees of severity
and constellations of pathological personality traits.

Personality Disorder Diagnosis

Individuals who have a pattern of impairment in personality functioning
and maladaptive traits that matches one of the six defined personality
disorders should be diagnosed with that personality disorder. If an
individual also has one or even several prominent traits that may have
clinical relevance in addition to those required for the diagnosis
(e.g., see narcissistic personality disorder), the option exists for
these to be noted as specifiers. Individuals whose personality
functioning or trait pattern is substantially different from that of any
of the six specific personality disorders should be diagnosed with
PD-TS. The individual may not meet the required number of A or B
criteria and, thus, have a subthreshold presentation of a personality
disorder. The individual may have a mix of features of personality
disorder types or some features that are less characteristic of a type
and more accurately considered a mixed or atypical presentation. The
specific level of impairment in personality functioning and the
pathological personality traits that characterize the individual's
personality can be specified for PD-TS, using the Level of Personality
Functioning Scale (Table 2) and the pathological trait taxonomy (Table
3). The current diagnoses of paranoid, schizoid, histrionic, and
dependent personality disorders are represented also by the diagnosis of
PD-TS; these are defined by moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning and can be specified by the relevant
pathological personality trait combinations.

Level of Personality Functioning

Like most human tendencies, personality functioning is distributed on a
continuum. Central to functioning and adaptation are individuals'
characteristic ways of thinking about and understanding themselves and
their interactions with others. An optimally functioning individual has
a complex, fully elaborated, and well-integrated psychological world
that includes a mostly positive, volitional, and adaptive self-concept;
a rich, broad, and appropriately regulated emotional life; and the
capacity to behave as a productive member of society with reciprocal and
fulfilling interpersonal relationships. At the opposite end of the
continuum, an individual with severe personality pathology has an
impoverished, disorganized, and/or conflicted psychological world that
includes a weak, unclear, and maladaptive self-concept; a propensity to
negative, dysregulated emotions; and a deficient capacity for adaptive
interpersonal functioning and social behavior.

[]{#index_split_110.html#p817}**772**

Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders

*Self-* and *Interpersonal* Functioning

Dimensional Definition

Generalized severity may be the most important single predictor of
concurrent and prospective dysfunction in assessing personality
psychopathology. Personality disorders are optimally characterized by a
generalized personality severity continuum with additional specification
of stylistic elements, derived from personality disorder symptom
constellations and personality traits. At the same time, the core of
personality psychopathology is impairment in ideas and feelings
regarding self and interpersonal relationships; this notion is
consistent with multiple theories of personality disorder and their
research bases. The components of the Level of Personality Functioning
Scale---identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy (see Table
1)---are particularly central in describing a personality functioning
continuum.

Mental representations of the self and interpersonal relationships are
reciprocally influential and inextricably tied, affect the nature of
interaction with mental health professionals, and can have a significant
impact on both treatment efficacy and outcome, underscoring the
importance of assessing an individual's characteristic self-concept as
well as views of other people and relationships. Although the degree of
disturbance in the self and interpersonal functioning is continuously
distributed, it is useful to consider the level of impairment in
functioning for clinical characterization and for treatment planning and
prognosis.

Rating Level of Personality Functioning

To use the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS), the clinician
selects the level that most closely captures the individual's *current
overall* level of impairment in personality functioning. The rating is
necessary for the diagnosis of a personality disorder (moderate or
greater impairment) and can be used to specify the severity of
impairment present for an individual with any personality disorder at a
given point in time. The LPFS may also be used as a global indicator of
personality functioning without specification of a personality disorder
diagnosis, or in the event that personality impairment is subthreshold
for a disorder diagnosis.

Personality Traits

Definition and Description

Criterion B in the alternative model involves assessments of personality
traits that are grouped into five domains. A *personality trait* is a
tendency to feel, perceive, behave, and think in relatively consistent
ways across time and across situations in which the trait may manifest.
For example, individuals with a high level of the personality trait of
*anxiousness* would tend to *feel* anxious readily, including in
circumstances in which most people would be calm and relaxed.
Individuals high in trait anxiousness also would *perceive* situations
to be anxiety-provoking more frequently than would individuals with
lower levels of this trait, and those high in the trait would tend to
*behave* so as to avoid situations that they *think* would make them
anxious. They would thereby tend to *think* about the world as more
anxiety provoking than other people.

Importantly, individuals high in trait anxiousness would not necessarily
be anxious at all times and in all situations. Individuals' trait levels
also can and do change throughout life. Some changes are very general
and reflect maturation (e.g., teenagers generally are higher on trait
impulsivity than are older adults), whereas other changes reflect
individuals' life experiences.

Dimensionality of personality traits.

All individuals can be located on the spectrum of

trait dimensions; that is, personality traits apply to everyone in
different degrees rather

[]{#index_split_110.html#p818}Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality
Disorders **773**

than being present versus absent. Moreover, personality traits,
including those identified specifically in the Section III model, exist
on a spectrum with two opposing poles. For example, the opposite of the
trait of *callousness* is the tendency to be empathic and kind-hearted,
even in circumstances in which most persons would not feel that way.
Hence, although in Section III this trait is labeled *callousness,*
because that pole of the dimension is the primary focus, it could be
described in full as *callousness versus kind-heartedness.* Moreover,
its opposite pole can be recognized and may not be adaptive in all
circumstances (e.g., individuals who, due to extreme kind-heartedness,
repeatedly allow themselves to be taken advantage of by unscrupulous
others).

Hierarchical structure of personality.

Some trait terms are quite specific (e.g., "talkative") and describe a
narrow range of behaviors, whereas others are quite broad (e.g.,
Detachment) and characterize a wide range of behavioral propensities.
Broad trait dimensions are called *domains,* and specific trait
dimensions are called *facets.* Personality trait *domains* comprise a
spectrum of more specific personality *facets* that tend to occur
together. For example, withdrawal and anhedonia are specific trait
*facets* in the trait *domain* of Detachment.

Despite some cross-cultural variation in personality trait facets, the
broad domains they collectively comprise are relatively consistent
across cultures.

The Personality Trait Model

The Section III personality trait system includes five broad domains of
personality trait variation---Negative Affectivity (vs. Emotional
Stability), Detachment (vs. Extraversion), Antagonism (vs.
Agreeableness), Disinhibition (vs. Conscientiousness), and Psychoticism
(vs. Lucidity)---comprising 25 specific personality trait facets. Table
3 provides definitions of all personality domains and facets. These five
broad domains are maladaptive variants of the five domains of the
extensively validated and replicated personality model known as the "Big
Five", or Five Factor Model of personality (FFM), and are also similar
to the domains of the Personality Psychopathology Five (PSY-5). The
specific 25 facets represent a list of personality facets chosen for
their clinical relevance.

Although the Trait Model focuses on personality traits associated with
psychopathology, there are healthy, adaptive, and resilient personality
traits identified as the polar opposites of these traits, as noted in
the parentheses above (i.e., Emotional Stability, Extraversion,
Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Lucidity). Their presence can
greatly mitigate the effects of mental disorders and facilitate coping
and recovery from traumatic injuries and other medical illness.

Distinguishing Traits, Symptoms, and Specific Behaviors Although traits
are by no means immutable and do change throughout the life span, they
show relative consistency compared with symptoms and specific behaviors.
For example, a person may behave impulsively at a specific time for a
specific reason (e.g., a person who is rarely impulsive suddenly decides
to spend a great deal of money on a particular item because of an
unusual opportunity to purchase something of unique value), but it is
only when behaviors aggregate across time and circumstance, such that a
pattern of behavior distinguishes between individuals, that they reflect
traits. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize, for example, that
even people who are impulsive are not acting impulsively all of the
time. A trait is a tendency or disposition toward specific behaviors; a
specific behavior is an instance or manifestation of a trait.

Similarly, traits are distinguished from most symptoms because symptoms
tend to wax and wane, whereas traits are relatively more stable. For
example, individuals with higher levels of *depressivity* have a greater
likelihood of experiencing discrete episodes of a depressive disorder
and of showing the symptoms of these disorders, such difficulty
concentrating. However, even patients who have a trait propensity to
*depressivity* typically cycle through distinguishable episodes of mood
disturbance, and specific symptoms such as
[]{#index_split_110.html#p819}**774**

Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders

difficulty concentrating tend to wax and wane in concert with specific
episodes, so they do not form part of the trait definition. Importantly,
however, symptoms and traits are both amenable to intervention, and many
interventions targeted at symptoms can affect the longer term patterns
of personality functioning that are captured by personality traits.

Assessment of the DSM-5 Section III

Personality Trait Model

The clinical utility of the Section III multidimensional personality
trait model lies in its ability to focus attention on multiple relevant
areas of personality variation in each individual patient.

Rather than focusing attention on the identification of one and only one
optimal diagnostic label, clinical application of the Section III
personality trait model involves reviewing all five broad personality
domains portrayed in Table 3. The clinical approach to personality is
similar to the well-known review of systems in clinical medicine. For
example, an individual's presenting complaint may focus on a specific
neurological symptom, yet during an initial evaluation clinicians still
systematically review functioning in all relevant systems (e.g.,
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal), lest an important area
of diminished functioning and corresponding opportunity for effective
intervention be missed.

Clinical use of the Section III personality trait model proceeds
similarly. An initial inquiry reviews all five broad domains of
personality. This systematic review is facilitated by the use of formal
psychometric instruments designed to measure specific facets and domains
of personality. For example, the personality trait model is
operationalized in the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5), which
can be completed in its self-report form by patients and in its
informant-report form by those who know the patient well (e.g., a
spouse). A detailed clinical assessment would involve collection of both
patient-and informant-report data on all 25 facets of the personality
trait model. However, if this is not possible, due to time or other
constraints, assessment focused at the five-domain level is an
acceptable clinical option when only a general (vs. detailed) portrait
of a patient's personality is needed (see Criterion B of PD-TS).
However, if personality-based problems are the focus of treatment, then
it will be important to assess individuals' trait facets as well as
domains.

Because personality traits are continuously distributed in the
population, an approach to making the judgment that a specific trait is
elevated (and therefore is present for diagnostic purposes) could
involve comparing individuals' personality trait levels with population
norms and/or clinical judgment. If a trait is elevated---that is, formal
psychometric testing and/or interview data support the clinical judgment
of elevation---then it is considered as contributing to meeting
Criterion B of Section III personality disorders.

Clinical Utility of the Multidimensional Personality

Functioning and Trait Model

Disorder and trait constructs each add value to the other in predicting
important antecedent (e.g., family history, history of child abuse),
concurrent (e.g., functional impairment, medication use), and predictive
(e.g., hospitalization, suicide attempts) variables. DSM-5

impairments in personality functioning and pathological personality
traits each contribute independently to clinical decisions about degree
of disability; risks for self-harm, violence, and criminality;
recommended treatment type and intensity; and prognosis---all important
aspects of the utility of psychiatric diagnoses. Notably, knowing the
level of an individual's personality functioning and his or her
pathological trait profile also provides the clinician with a rich base
of information and is valuable in treatment planning and in predicting
the course and outcome of many mental disorders in addition to
personality disorders. Therefore, assessment of personality functioning
and pathological personality traits may be relevant whether an
individual has a personality disorder or not.

Proposed criteria sets are presented for conditions on which future
research is encouraged. The specific items, thresholds, and durations
contained in these research criteria sets were set by expert
consensus---informed by literature review, data reanalysis, and field
trial results, where available---and are intended to provide a common
language for researchers and clinicians who are interested in studying
these disorders. It is hoped that such research will allow the field to
better understand these conditions and will inform decisions about
possible placement in forthcoming editions of DSM. The DSM-5 Task Force
and Work Groups subjected each of these proposed criteria sets to a
careful empirical review and invited wide commentary from the field as
well as from the general public.

The Task Force determined that there was insufficient evidence to
warrant inclusion of these proposals as official mental disorder
diagnoses in Section II. ***These proposed criteria***

disorders in Section II of***

***DSM-5 are officially recognized and can be used for clinical
purposes.***

Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome

Proposed Criteria

 

A. At least one of the following symptoms is present in attenuated form,
with relatively intact reality testing, and is of sufficient severity or
frequency to warrant clinical attention: 1. Delusions.

2\. Hallucinations.

3\. Disorganized speech.

B. Symptom(s) must have been present at least once per week for the past
month.

C. Symptom(s) must have begun or worsened in the past year.

D. Symptom(s) is sufficiently distressing and disabling to the
individual to warrant clinical attention.

E. Symptom(s) is not better explained by another mental disorder,
including a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, and
is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or
another medical condition.

F. Criteria for any psychotic disorder have never been met.

Diagnostic Features

Attenuated psychotic symptoms, as defined in Criterion A, are
psychosis-like but below the threshold for a full psychotic disorder.
Compared with psychotic disorders, the symptoms are less severe and more
transient, and insight is relatively maintained. A diagnosis of
attenuated psychosis syndrome requires state psychopathology associated
with functional impairment rather than long-standing trait pathology.
The psychopathology has not progressed to full psychotic severity.
Attenuated psychosis syndrome is a disorder based on the manifest
pathology and impaired function and distress. Changes in experiences and

[]{#index_split_118.html#p829}**784**

Conditions for Further Study

iors are noted by the individual and/or others, suggesting a change in
mental state (i.e., the symptoms are of sufficient severity or frequency
to warrant clinical attention) (Criterion A).

Attenuated delusions (Criterion A1) may have suspiciousness/persecutory
ideational content, including persecutory ideas of reference. The
individual may have a guarded, distrustful attitude. When the delusions
are moderate in severity, the individual views others as untrustworthy
and may be hypervigilant or sense ill will in others. When the delusions
are severe but still within the attenuated range, the individual
entertains loosely organized beliefs about danger or hostile intention,
but the delusions do not have the fixed nature that is necessary for the
diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Guarded behavior in the interview can
interfere with the ability to gather information. Reality testing and
perspective can be elicited with nonconfirming evidence, but the
propensity for viewing the world as hostile and dangerous remains
strong. Attenuated delusions may have grandiose content presenting as an
unrealistic sense of superior capacity. When the delusions are moderate,
the individual harbors notions of being gifted, influential, or special.
When the delusions are severe, the individual has beliefs of superiority
that often alienate friends and worry relatives. Thoughts of being
special may lead to unrealistic plans and investments, yet skepticism
about these attitudes can be elicited with persistent questioning and
confrontation.

Attenuated hallucinations (Criterion A2) include alterations in sensory
perceptions, usually auditory and/or visual. When the hallucinations are
moderate, the sounds and images are often unformed (e.g., shadows,
trails, halos, murmurs, rumbling), and they are experienced as unusual
or puzzling. When the hallucinations are severe, these experiences
become more vivid and frequent (i.e., recurring illusions or
hallucinations that capture attention and affect thinking and
concentration). These perceptual abnormalities may disrupt behavior, but
skepticism about their reality can still be induced.

Disorganized communication (Criterion A3) may manifest as odd speech
(vague, metaphorical, overelaborate, stereotyped), unfocused speech
(confused, muddled, too fast or too slow, wrong words, irrelevant
context, off track), or meandering speech (circumstantial, tangential).
When the disorganization is moderately severe, the individual frequently
gets into irrelevant topics but responds easily to clarifying questions.
Speech may be odd but understandable. At the moderately severe level,
speech becomes meandering and circumstantial, and when the
disorganization is severe, the individual fails to get to the point
without external guidance (tangential). At the severe level, some
thought blocking and/or loose associations may occur infrequently,
especially when the individual is under pressure, but re-orienting
questions quickly return structure and organization to the conversation.

The individual realizes that changes in mental state and/or in
relationships are taking place. He or she maintains reasonable insight
into the psychotic-like experiences and generally appreciates that
altered perceptions are not real and magical ideation is not compelling.
The individual must experience distress and/or impaired performance in
social or role functioning (Criterion D), and the individual or
responsible others must note the changes and express concern, such that
clinical care is sought (Criterion A).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The individual may experience magical thinking, perceptual aberrations,
difficulty in concentration, some disorganization in thought or
behavior, excessive suspiciousness, anxiety, social withdrawal, and
disruption in sleep-wake cycle. Impaired cognitive function and negative
symptoms are often observed. Neuroimaging variables distinguish cohorts
with attenuated psychosis syndrome from normal control cohorts with
patterns similar to, but less severe than, that observed in
schizophrenia. However, neuroimaging data is not diagnostic at the
individual level.

Prevalence

The prevalence of attenuated psychosis syndrome is unknown. Symptoms in
Criterion A are not uncommon in the non-help-seeking population, ranging
from 8%--13% for hallu-

[]{#index_split_118.html#p830}Conditions for Further Study

**785**

cinatory experiences and delusional thinking. There appears to be a
slight male preponderance for attenuated psychosis syndrome.

Development and Course

Onset of attenuated psychosis syndrome is usually in mid-to-late
adolescence or early adulthood. It may be preceded by normal development
or evidence for impaired cognition, negative symptoms, and/or impaired
social development. In help-seeking cohorts, approximately 18% in 1 year
and 32% in 3 years may progress symptomatically and met criteria for a
psychotic disorder. In some cases, the syndrome may transition to a
depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, but development
to a schizophrenia spectrum disorder is more frequent. It appears that
the diagnosis is best applied to individuals ages 15--35 years.
Long-term course is not yet described beyond 7--12 years.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental.

Factors predicting prognosis of attenuated psychosis syndrome have not
been definitively characterized, but the presence of negative symptoms,
cognitive impairment, and poor functioning are associated with poor
outcome and increase risk of transition to psychosis.

Genetic and physiological.

A family history of psychosis places the individual with attenuated
psychosis syndrome at increased risk for developing a full psychotic
disorder.

Structural, functional, and neurochemical imaging data are associated
with increased risk of transition to psychosis.

Functional Consequences of

Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome

Many individuals may experience functional impairments.
Modest-to-moderate impairment in social and role functioning may persist
even with abatement of symptoms. A substantial portion of individuals
with the diagnosis will improve over time; many continue to have mild
symptoms and impairment, and many others will have a full recovery.

Differential Diagnosis

Brief psychotic disorder.

When symptoms of attenuated psychosis syndrome initially manifest, they
may resemble symptoms of brief psychotic disorder. However, in
attenuated psychosis syndrome, the symptoms do not cross the psychosis
threshold and reality testing/insight remains intact.

Schizotypal personality disorder.

Schizotypal personality disorder, although having

symptomatic features that are similar to those of attenuated psychosis
syndrome, is a relatively stable trait disorder not meeting the
state-dependent aspects (Criterion C) of attenuated psychosis syndrome.
In addition, a broader array of symptoms is required for schizotypal
personality disorder, although in the early stages of presentation it
may resemble attenuated psychosis syndrome.

Depressive or bipolar disorders.

Reality distortions that are temporally limited to an episode of a major
depressive disorder or bipolar disorder and are descriptively more
characteristic of those disorders do not meet Criterion E for attenuated
psychosis syndrome. For example, feelings of low self-esteem or
attributions of low regard from others in the context of major
depressive disorder would not qualify for comorbid attenuated psychosis
syndrome.

Anxiety disorders.

Reality distortions that are temporally limited to an episode of an
anxiety disorder and are descriptively more characteristic of an anxiety
disorder do not

[]{#index_split_118.html#p831}**786**

Conditions for Further Study

meet Criterion E for attenuated psychosis syndrome. For example, a
feeling of being the focus of undesired attention in the context of
social anxiety disorder would not qualify for comorbid attenuated
psychosis syndrome.

Bipolar II disorder.

Reality distortions that are temporally limited to an episode of mania
or hypomania and are descriptively more characteristic of bipolar
disorder do not meet Criterion E for attenuated psychosis syndrome. For
example, inflated self-esteem in the context of pressured speech and
reduced need for sleep would not qualify for comorbid attenuated
psychosis syndrome.

Borderline personality disorder.

Reality distortions that are concomitant with borderline personality
disorder and are descriptively more characteristic of it do not meet
Criterion E for attenuated psychosis syndrome. For example, a sense of
being unable to experience feelings in the context of an intense fear of
real or imagined abandonment and recurrent self-mutilation would not
qualify for comorbid attenuated psychosis syndrome.

Adjustment reaction of adolescence.

Mild, transient symptoms typical of normal development and consistent
with the degree of stress experienced do not qualify for attenuated
psychosis syndrome.

Extreme end of perceptual aberration and magical thinking in the non-ill
population.

This diagnostic possibility should be strongly entertained when reality
distortions are not associated with distress and functional impairment
and need for care.

Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.

Substance use is common among

individuals whose symptoms meet attenuated psychosis syndrome criteria.
When otherwise qualifying characteristic symptoms are strongly
temporally related to substance use episodes, Criterion E for attenuated
psychosis syndrome may not be met, and a diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder may be preferred.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

A history of attentional impairment does not

exclude a current attenuated psychosis syndrome diagnosis. Earlier
attentional impairment may be a prodromal condition or comorbid
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Comorbidity

Individuals with attenuated psychosis syndrome often experience anxiety
and/or depression. Some individuals with an attenuated psychosis
syndrome diagnosis will progress to another diagnosis, including
anxiety, depressive, bipolar, and personality disorders. In such cases,
the psychopathology associated with the attenuated psychosis syndrome
diagnosis is reconceptualized as the prodromal phase of another
disorder, not a comorbid condition.

Depressive Episodes With Short-Duration Hypomania

Proposed Criteria

**Lifetime experience of at least one major depressive episode meeting
the following** **criteria:**

A. Five (or more) of the following criteria have been present during the
same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at
least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of
interest or pleasure. (**Note:** Do not include symptoms that are
clearly attributable to a medical condition.) 1. Depressed mood most of
the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report
(e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others
(e.g., appears tearful). (**Note:** In children and adolescents, can be
irritable mood.) 2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or
almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated
by either subjective account or observation).

[]{#index_split_118.html#p832}Conditions for Further Study

**787**

3\. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a
change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or
increase in appetite nearly every day. (**Note:** In children, consider
failure to make expected weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly
every day.

5\. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by
others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed
down).

6\. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.

7\. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which
may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt
about being sick).

8\. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness,
nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by
others).

9\. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent
suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a
specific plan for committing suicide.

B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or another medical condition.

D. The disturbance is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder
and is not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,
delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder.

**At least two lifetime episodes of hypomanic periods that involve the
required criterion symptoms below but are of insufficient duration (at
least 2 days but less than** **4 consecutive days) to meet criteria for
a hypomanic episode. The criterion symptoms are as follows:**

A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive,
or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased
goal-directed activity or energy.

B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and
activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted (four
if the mood is only irritable), represent a noticeable change from usual
behavior, and have been present to a significant degree: 1. Inflated
self-esteem or grandiosity.

2\. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of
sleep).

3\. More talkative than usual or pressured to keep talking.

4\. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.

5\. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or
irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.

6\. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or
school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.

7\. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for
painful consequences (e.g., the individual engages in unrestrained
buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).

C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning
that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.

D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable
by others.

E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social
or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there
are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic.

F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).

[]{#index_split_118.html#p833}**788**

Conditions for Further Study

Diagnostic Features

Individuals with short-duration hypomania have experienced at least one
major depressive episode as well as at least two episodes of 2--3 days'
duration in which criteria for a hypomanic episode were met (except for
symptom duration). These episodes are of sufficient intensity to be
categorized as a hypomanic episode but do not meet the 4-day duration
requirement. Symptoms are present to a significant degree, such that
they represent a noticeable change from the individual's normal
behavior.

An individual with a history of a syndromal hypomanic episode and a
major depressive episode by definition has bipolar II disorder,
regardless of current duration of hypomanic symptoms.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Individuals who have experienced both short-duration hypomania and a
major depressive episode, with their increased comorbidity with
substance use disorders and a greater family history of bipolar
disorder, more closely resemble individuals with bipolar disorder than
those with major depressive disorder.

Differences have also been found between individuals with short-duration
hypomania and those with syndromal bipolar disorder. Work impairment was
greater for individuals with syndromal bipolar disorder, as was the
estimated average number of episodes. Individuals with short-duration
hypomania may exhibit less severity than individuals with syndromal
hypomanic episodes, including less mood lability.

Prevalence

The prevalence of short-duration hypomania is unclear, since the
criteria are new as of this edition of the manual. Using somewhat
different criteria, however, it has been estimated that short-duration
hypomania occurs in 2.8% of the population (compared with hypomania or
mania in 5.5% of the population). Short-duration hypomania may be more
common in females, who may present with more features of atypical
depression.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

A family history of mania is two to three times more common in
individuals with short-duration hypomania compared with the general
population, but less than half as common as in individuals with a
history of syndromal mania or hypomania.

Suicide Risk

Individuals with short-duration hypomania have higher rates of suicide
attempts than healthy individuals, although not as high as the rates in
individuals with syndromal bipolar disorder.

Functional Consequences of Short-Duration Hypomania

Functional impairments associated specifically with short-duration
hypomania are as yet not fully determined. However, research suggests
that individuals with this disorder have less work impairment than
individuals with syndromal bipolar disorder but more comorbid substance
use disorders, particularly alcohol use disorder, than individuals with
major depressive disorder.

Differential Diagnosis

Bipolar II disorder.

Bipolar II disorder is characterized by a period of at least 4 days of
hypomanic symptoms, whereas short-duration hypomania is characterized by
periods of

[]{#index_split_118.html#p834}Conditions for Further Study

**789**

2--3 days of hypomanic symptoms. Once an individual has experienced a
hypomanic episode (4 days or more), the diagnosis becomes and remains
bipolar II disorder regardless of future duration of hypomanic symptom
periods.

Major depressive disorder.

Major depressive disorder is also characterized by at least one lifetime
major depressive episode. However, the additional presence of at least
two lifetime periods of 2--3 days of hypomanic symptoms leads to a
diagnosis of short-duration hypomania rather than to major depressive
disorder.

Major depressive disorder with mixed features.

Both major depressive disorder with

mixed features and short-duration hypomania are characterized by the
presence of some hypomanic symptoms and a major depressive episode.
However, major depressive disorder with mixed features is characterized
by hypomanic features present *concurrently* with a major depressive
episode, while individuals with short-duration hypomania experience
subsyndromal hypomania and fully syndromal major depression at different
times.

Bipolar I disorder.

Bipolar I disorder is differentiated from short-duration hypomania by at
least one lifetime manic episode, which is longer (at least 1 week) and
more severe (causes more impaired social functioning) than a hypomanic
episode. An episode (of any duration) that involves psychotic symptoms
or necessitates hospitalization is by definition a manic episode rather
than a hypomanic one.

Cyclothymic disorder.

While cyclothymic disorder is characterized by periods of depressive
symptoms and periods of hypomanic symptoms, the lifetime presence of a
major depressive episode precludes the diagnosis of cyclothymic
disorder.

Comorbidity

Short-duration hypomania, similar to full hypomanic episodes, has been
associated with higher rates of comorbid anxiety disorders and substance
use disorders than are found in the general population.

Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder

Proposed Criteria

 

A. The individual experienced the death of someone with whom he or she
had a close relationship.

B. Since the death, at least one of the following symptoms is
experienced on more days than not and to a clinically significant degree
and has persisted for at least 12 months after the death in the case of
bereaved adults and 6 months for bereaved children: 1. Persistent
yearning/longing for the deceased. In young children, yearning may be
expressed in play and behavior, including behaviors that reflect being
separated from, and also reuniting with, a caregiver or other attachment
figure.

2\. Intense sorrow and emotional pain in response to the death.

3\. Preoccupation with the deceased.

4\. Preoccupation with the circumstances of the death. In children, this
preoccupation with the deceased may be expressed through the themes of
play and behavior and may extend to preoccupation with possible death of
others close to them.

C. Since the death, at least six of the following symptoms are
experienced on more days than not and to a clinically significant
degree, and have persisted for at least 12 months after the death in the
case of bereaved adults and 6 months for bereaved children:

[]{#index_split_118.html#p835}**790**

Conditions for Further Study

**Reactive distress to the death**

1\. Marked difficulty accepting the death. In children, this is
dependent on the child's capacity to comprehend the meaning and
permanence of death.

2\. Experiencing disbelief or emotional numbness over the loss.

3\. Difficulty with positive reminiscing about the deceased.

4\. Bitterness or anger related to the loss.

5\. Maladaptive appraisals about oneself in relation to the deceased or
the death (e.g., self-blame).

6\. Excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss (e.g., avoidance of
individuals, places, or situations associated with the deceased; in
children, this may include avoidance of thoughts and feelings regarding
the deceased).

**Social/identity disruption**

7\. A desire to die in order to be with the deceased.

8\. Difficulty trusting other individuals since the death.

9\. Feeling alone or detached from other individuals since the death.

10\. Feeling that life is meaningless or empty without the deceased, or
the belief that one cannot function without the deceased.

11\. Confusion about one's role in life, or a diminished sense of one's
identity (e.g., feeling that a part of oneself died with the deceased).

12\. Difficulty or reluctance to pursue interests since the loss or to
plan for the future (e.g., friendships, activities).

D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

E. The bereavement reaction is out of proportion to or inconsistent with
cultural, religious, or age-appropriate norms.

*Specify* if:

**With traumatic bereavement:** Bereavement due to homicide or suicide
with persistent distressing preoccupations regarding the traumatic
nature of the death (often in response to loss reminders), including the
deceased's last moments, degree of suffering and mutilating injury, or
the malicious or intentional nature of the death.

Diagnostic Features

Persistent complex bereavement disorder is diagnosed only if at least 12
months (6 months in children) have elapsed since the death of someone
with whom the bereaved had a close relationship (Criterion A). This time
frame discriminates normal grief from persistent grief. The condition
typically involves a persistent yearning/longing for the deceased
(Criterion B1), which may be associated with intense sorrow and frequent
crying (Criterion B2) or preoccupation with the deceased (Criterion B3).
The individual may also be preoccupied with the manner in which the
person died (Criterion B4).

Six additional symptoms are required, including marked difficulty
accepting that the individual has died (Criterion C1) (e.g. preparing
meals for them), disbelief that the individual is dead (Criterion C2),
distressing memories of the deceased (Criterion C3), anger over the loss
(Criterion C4), maladaptive appraisals about oneself in relation to the
deceased or the death (Criterion C5), and excessive avoidance of
reminders of the loss (Criterion C6). Individuals may also report a
desire to die because they wish to be with the deceased (Criterion C7);
be distrustful of others (Criterion C8); feel isolated (Criterion C9);
believe that life has no meaning or purpose without the deceased
(Criterion C10); experience a diminished sense of identity in which they
feel a part of themselves has died or been lost (Criterion C11); or have
difficulty engaging in activities, pursuing relationships, or planning
for the future (Criterion C12).

[]{#index_split_118.html#p836}Conditions for Further Study

**791**

Persistent complex bereavement disorder requires clinically significant
distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning (Criterion D). The
nature and severity of grief must be beyond expected norms for the
relevant cultural setting, religious group, or developmental stage
(Criterion E). Although there are variations in how grief can manifest,
the symptoms of persistent complex bereavement disorder occur in both
genders and in diverse social and cultural groups.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Some individuals with persistent complex bereavement disorder experience
hallucinations of the deceased (auditory or visual) in which they
temporarily perceive the deceased's presence (e.g., seeing the deceased
sitting in his or her favorite chair). They may also experience diverse
somatic complaints (e.g., digestive complaints, pain, fatigue),
including symptoms experienced by the deceased.

Prevalence

The prevalence of persistent complex bereavement disorder is
approximately 2.4%--4.8%.

The disorder is more prevalent in females than in males.

Development and Course

Persistent complex bereavement disorder can occur at any age, beginning
after the age of 1 year. Symptoms usually begin within the initial
months after the death, although there may be a delay of months, or even
years, before the full syndrome appears. Although grief responses
commonly appear immediately following bereavement, these reactions are
not diagnosed as persistent complex bereavement disorder unless the
symptoms persist beyond 12 months (6 months for children).

Young children may experience the loss of a primary caregiver as
traumatic, given the disorganizing effects the caregiver's absence can
have on a child's coping response. In children, the distress may be
expressed in play and behavior, developmental regressions, and anxious
or protest behavior at times of separation and reunion. Separation
distress may be predominant in younger children, and social/identity
distress and risk for comorbid depression can increasingly manifest in
older children and adolescents.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Risk for persistent complex bereavement disorder is heightened by
increased dependency on the deceased person prior to the death and by
the death of a child.

Disturbances in caregiver support increase the risk for bereaved
children.

Genetic and physiological.

Risk for the disorder is heightened by the bereaved individual being
female.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The symptoms of persistent complex bereavement disorder are observed
across cultural settings, but grief responses may manifest in culturally
specific ways. Diagnosis of the disorder requires that the persistent
and severe responses go beyond cultural norms of grief responses and not
be better explained by culturally specific mourning rituals.

Suicide Risk

Individuals with persistent complex bereavement disorder frequently
report suicidal ideation.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p837}**792**

Conditions for Further Study

Functional Consequences of

Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder

Persistent complex bereavement disorder is associated with deficits in
work and social functioning and with harmful health behaviors, such as
increased tobacco and alcohol use. It is also associated with marked
increases in risks for serious medical conditions, including cardiac
disease, hypertension, cancer, immunological deficiency, and reduced
quality of life.

Differential Diagnosis

Normal grief.

Persistent complex bereavement disorder is distinguished from normal
grief by the presence of severe grief reactions that persist at least 12
months (or 6 months in children) after the death of the bereaved. It is
only when severe levels of grief response persist at least 12 months
following the death and interfere with the individual's capacity to
function that persistent complex bereavement disorder is diagnosed.

Depressive disorders.

Persistent complex bereavement disorder, major depressive disorder, and
persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) share sadness, crying, and
suicidal thinking. Whereas major depressive disorder and persistent
depressive disorder can share depressed mood with persistent complex
bereavement disorder, the latter is characterized by a focus on the
loss.

Posttraumatic stress disorder.

Individuals who experience bereavement as a result of traumatic death
may develop both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and persistent
complex bereavement disorder. Both conditions can involve intrusive
thoughts and avoidance.

Whereas intrusions in PTSD revolve around the traumatic event, intrusive
memories in persistent complex bereavement disorder focus on thoughts
about many aspects of the relationship with the deceased, including
positive aspects of the relationship and distress over the separation.
In individuals with the traumatic bereavement specifier of persistent
complex bereavement disorder, the distressing thoughts or feelings may
be more overtly related to the manner of death, with distressing
fantasies of what happened. Both persistent complex bereavement disorder
and PTSD can involve avoidance of reminders of distressing events.

Whereas avoidance in PTSD is characterized by consistent avoidance of
internal and external reminders of the traumatic experience, in
persistent complex bereavement disorder, there is also a preoccupation
with the loss and yearning for the deceased, which is absent in PTSD.

Separation anxiety disorder.

Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by anxiety about separation
from current attachment figures, whereas persistent complex bereavement
disorder involves distress about separation from a deceased individual.

Comorbidity

The most common comorbid disorders with persistent complex bereavement
disorder are major depressive disorder, PTSD, and substance use
disorders. PTSD is more frequently comorbid with persistent complex
bereavement disorder when the death occurred in traumatic or violent
circumstances.

Caffeine Use Disorder

Proposed Criteria

A problematic pattern of caffeine use leading to clinically significant
impairment or distress, as manifested by at least the first three of the
following criteria occurring within a 12-month period: 1. A persistent
desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control caffeine use.

2\. Continued caffeine use despite knowledge of having a persistent or
recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been
caused or exacerbated by caffeine.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p838}Conditions for Further Study

**793**

3\. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The
characteristic withdrawal syndrome for caffeine.

b\. Caffeine (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or
avoid withdrawal symptoms.

4\. Caffeine is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period
than was intended.

5\. Recurrent caffeine use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated tardiness or
absences from work or school related to caffeine use or withdrawal).

6\. Continued caffeine use despite having persistent or recurrent social
or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of
caffeine (e.g., arguments with spouse about consequences of use, medical
problems, cost).

7\. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:

a\. A need for markedly increased amounts of caffeine to achieve desired
effect.

b\. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of
caffeine.

8\. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain
caffeine, use caffeine, or recover from its effects.

9\. Craving or a strong desire or urge to use caffeine.

A diagnosis of substance dependence due to caffeine is recognized by the
World Health Organization in ICD-10. Since the publication of DSM-IV in
1994, considerable research on caffeine dependence has been published,
and several recent reviews provide a current analysis of this
literature. There is now sufficient evidence to warrant inclusion of
caffeine use disorder as a research diagnosis in DSM-5 to encourage
additional research. The working diagnostic algorithm proposed for the
study of caffeine use disorder differs from that of the other substance
use disorders, reflecting the need to identify only cases that have
sufficient clinical importance to warrant the labeling of a mental
disorder. A key goal of including caffeine use disorder in this section
of DSM-5 is to stimulate research that will determine the reliability,
validity, and prevalence of caffeine use disorder based on the proposed
diagnostic schema, with particular attention to the association of the
diagnosis with functional impairments as part of validity testing.

The proposed criteria for caffeine use disorder reflect the need for a
diagnostic threshold higher than that used for the other substance use
disorders. Such a threshold is intended to prevent overdiagnosis of
caffeine use disorder due to the high rate of habitual nonproblematic
daily caffeine use in the general population.

Diagnostic Features

Caffeine use disorder is characterized by the continued use of caffeine
and failure to control use despite negative physical and/or
psychological consequences. In a survey of the general population, 14%
of caffeine users met the criterion of use despite harm, with most
reporting that a physician or counselor had advised them to stop or
reduce caffeine use within the last year. Medical and psychological
problems attributed to caffeine included heart, stomach, and urinary
problems, and complaints of anxiety, depression, insomnia, irritability,
and difficulty thinking. In the same survey, 45% of caffeine users
reported desire or unsuccessful efforts to control caffeine use, 18%
reported withdrawal, 8% reported tolerance, 28% used more than intended,
and 50% reported spending a great deal of time using caffeine. In
addition, 19% reported a strong desire for caffeine that they could not
resist, and less than 1% reported that caffeine had interfered with
social activities.

Among those seeking treatment for quitting problematic caffeine use, 88%
reported having made prior serious attempts to modify caffeine use, and
43% reported having been advised by a medical professional to reduce or
eliminate caffeine. Ninety-three percent endorsed signs and symptoms
meeting DSM-IV criteria for caffeine dependence, with the

[]{#index_split_118.html#p839}**794**

Conditions for Further Study

most commonly endorsed criteria being withdrawal (96%), persistent
desire or unsuccessful efforts to control use (89%), and use despite
knowledge of physical or psychological problems caused by caffeine
(87%). The most common reasons for wanting to modify caffeine use were
health-related (59%) and a desire to not be dependent on caffeine (35%).

The DSM-5 discussion of caffeine withdrawal in the Section II chapter
"Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders" provides information on the
features of the withdrawal criterion. It is well documented that
habitual caffeine users can experience a well-defined withdrawal
syndrome upon acute abstinence from caffeine, and many
caffeine-dependent individuals report continued use of caffeine to avoid
experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

Prevalence

The prevalence of caffeine use disorder in the general population is
unclear. Based on all seven generic DSM-IV-TR criteria for dependence,
30% of current caffeine users may have met DSM-IV criteria for a
diagnosis of caffeine dependence, with endorsement of three or more
dependence criteria, during the past year. When only four of the seven
criteria (the three primary criteria proposed above plus tolerance) are
used, the prevalence appears to drop to 9%. Thus, the expected
prevalence of caffeine use disorder among regular caffeine users is
likely less than 9%. Given that approximately 75%--80% of the general
population uses caffeine regularly, the estimated prevalence would be
less than 7%. Among regular caffeine drinkers at higher risk for
caffeine use problems (e.g., high school and college students,
individuals in drug treatment, and individuals at pain clinics who have
recent histories of alcohol or illicit drug misuse), approximately 20%
may have a pattern of use that meets all three of the proposed criteria
in Criterion A.

Development and Course

Individuals whose pattern of use meets criteria for a caffeine use
disorder have shown a wide range of daily caffeine intake and have been
consumers of various types of caffeinated products (e.g., coffee, soft
drinks, tea) and medications. A diagnosis of caffeine use disorder has
been shown to prospectively predict a greater incidence of caffeine
reinforcement and more severe withdrawal.

There has been no longitudinal or cross-sectional lifespan research on
caffeine use disorder. Caffeine use disorder has been identified in both
adolescents and adults. Rates of caffeine consumption and overall level
of caffeine consumption tend to increase with age until the early to
mid-30s and then level off. Age-related factors for caffeine use
disorder are unknown, although concern is growing related to excessive
caffeine consumption among adolescents and young adults through use of
caffeinated energy drinks.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological.

Heritabilities of heavy caffeine use, caffeine tolerance, and caffeine
withdrawal range from 35% to 77%. For caffeine use, alcohol use, and
cigarette smoking, a common genetic factor (polysubstance use) underlies
the use of these three substances, with 28%--41% of the heritable
effects of caffeine use (or heavy use) shared with alcohol and smoking.
Caffeine and tobacco use disorders are associated and substantially
influenced by genetic factors unique to these licit drugs. The magnitude
of heritability for caffeine use disorder markers appears to be similar
to that for alcohol and tobacco use disorder markers.

Functional Consequences of Caffeine Use Disorder

Caffeine use disorder may predict greater use of caffeine during
pregnancy. Caffeine withdrawal, a key feature of caffeine use disorder,
has been shown to produce functional im-

[]{#index_split_118.html#p840}Conditions for Further Study

**795**

pairment in normal daily activities. Caffeine intoxication may include
symptoms of nausea and vomiting, as well as impairment of normal
activities. Significant disruptions in normal daily activities may occur
during caffeine abstinence.

Differential Diagnosis

Nonproblematic use of caffeine.

The distinction between nonproblematic use of caffeine and caffeine use
disorder can be difficult to make because social, behavioral, or
psychological problems may be difficult to attribute to the substance,
especially in the context of use of other substances. Regular, heavy
caffeine use that can result in tolerance and withdrawal is relatively
common, which by itself should not be sufficient for making a diagnosis.

Other stimulant use disorder.

Problems related to use of other stimulant medications or substances may
approximate the features of caffeine use disorder.

Anxiety disorders.

Chronic heavy caffeine use may mimic generalized anxiety disorder, and
acute caffeine consumption may produce and mimic panic attacks.

Comorbidity

There may be comorbidity between caffeine use disorder and daily
cigarette smoking, a family or personal history of alcohol use disorder.
Features of caffeine use disorder (e.g., tolerance, caffeine withdrawal)
may be positively associated with several diagnoses: major depression,
generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, adult antisocial
personality disorder, and alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine use disorders.

Internet Gaming Disorder

Proposed Criteria

Persistent and recurrent use of the Internet to engage in games, often
with other players, leading to clinically significant impairment or
distress as indicated by five (or more) of the following in a 12-month
period:

1\. Preoccupation with Internet games. (The individual thinks about
previous gaming activity or anticipates playing the next game; Internet
gaming becomes the dominant activity in daily life).

**Note:** This disorder is distinct from Internet gambling, which is
included under gambling disorder.

2\. Withdrawal symptoms when Internet gaming is taken away. (These
symptoms are typically described as irritability, anxiety, or sadness,
but there are no physical signs of pharmacological withdrawal.)

3\. Tolerance---the need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in
Internet games.

4\. Unsuccessful attempts to control the participation in Internet
games.

5\. Loss of interests in previous hobbies and entertainment as a result
of, and with the exception of, Internet games.

6\. Continued excessive use of Internet games despite knowledge of
psychosocial problems.

7\. Has deceived family members, therapists, or others regarding the
amount of Internet gaming.

8\. Use of Internet games to escape or relieve a negative mood (e.g.,
feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety).

9\. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or
educational or career opportunity because of participation in Internet
games.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p841}**796**

Conditions for Further Study

**Note:** Only nongambling Internet games are included in this disorder.
Use of the Internet for required activities in a business or profession
is not included; nor is the disorder intended to include other
recreational or social Internet use. Similarly, sexual Internet sites
are excluded.

*Specify current severity:*

Internet gaming disorder can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on
the degree of disruption of normal activities. Individuals with less
severe Internet gaming disorder may exhibit fewer symptoms and less
disruption of their lives. Those with severe Internet gaming disorder
will have more hours spent on the computer and more severe loss of
relationships or career or school opportunities.

Subtypes

There are no well-researched subtypes for Internet gaming disorder to
date. Internet gaming disorder most often involves specific Internet
games, but it could involve non-Internet computerized games as well,
although these have been less researched. It is likely that preferred
games will vary over time as new games are developed and popularized,
and it is unclear if behaviors and consequence associated with Internet
gaming disorder vary by game type.

Diagnostic Features

Gambling disorder is currently the only nonsubstance-related disorder
proposed for inclusion with DSM-5 substance-related and addictive
disorders. However, there are other behavioral disorders that show some
similarities to substance use disorders and gambling disorder for which
the word *addiction* is commonly used in nonmedical settings, and the
one condition with a considerable literature is the compulsive playing
of Internet games.

Internet gaming has been reportedly defined as an "addiction" by the
Chinese government, and a treatment system has been set up. Reports of
treatment of this condition have appeared in medical journals, mostly
from Asian countries and some in the United States.

The DSM-5 work group reviewed more than 240 articles and found some
behavioral similarities of Internet gaming to gambling disorder and to
substance use disorders. The literature suffers, however, from lack of a
standard definition from which to derive prevalence data. An
understanding of the natural histories of cases, with or without
treatment, is also missing. The literature does describe many underlying
similarities to substance addictions, including aspects of tolerance,
withdrawal, repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut back or quit, and
impairment in normal functioning. Further, the seemingly high prevalence
rates, both in Asian countries and, to a lesser extent, in the West,
justified inclusion of this disorder in Section III of DSM-5.

Internet gaming disorder has significant public health importance, and
additional research may eventually lead to evidence that Internet gaming
disorder (also commonly referred to as *Internet use disorder,*
*Internet addiction,* or *gaming addiction*) has merit as an independent
disorder. As with gambling disorder, there should be epidemiological
studies to determine prevalence, clinical course, possible genetic
influence, and potential biological factors based on, for example, brain
imaging data.

Internet gaming disorder is a pattern of excessive and prolonged
Internet gaming that results in a cluster of cognitive and behavioral
symptoms, including progressive loss of control over gaming, tolerance,
and withdrawal symptoms, analogous to the symptoms of substance use
disorders. As with substance-related disorders, individuals with
Internet gaming disorder continue to sit at a computer and engage in
gaming activities despite neglect of other activities. They typically
devote 8--10 hours or more per day to this activity and at least 30
hours per week. If they are prevented from using a computer and
returning to the game, they become agitated and angry. They often go for
long periods without food or sleep. Nor-

mal obligations, such as school or work, or family obligations are
neglected. This condition is separate from gambling disorder involving
the Internet because money is not at risk.

The essential feature of Internet gaming disorder is persistent and
recurrent participation in computer gaming, typically group games, for
many hours. These games involve competition between groups of players
(often in different global regions, so that duration of play is
encouraged by the time-zone independence) participating in complex
structured activities that include a significant aspect of social
interactions during play. Team aspects appear to be a key motivation.
Attempts to direct the individual toward schoolwork or interpersonal
activities are strongly resisted. Thus personal, family, or vocational
pursuits are neglected. When individuals are asked, the major reasons
given for using the computer are more likely to be "avoiding boredom"
rather than communicating or searching for information.

The description of criteria related to this condition is adapted from a
study in China. Until the optimal criteria and threshold for diagnosis
are determined empirically, conservative definitions ought to be used,
such that diagnoses are considered for endorsement of five or more of
nine criteria.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

No consistent personality types associated with Internet gaming disorder
have been identified. Some authors describe associated diagnoses, such
as depressive disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Individuals with compulsive Internet gaming have demonstrated brain
activation in specific regions triggered by exposure to the Internet
game but not limited to reward system structures

Prevalence

The prevalence of Internet gaming disorder is unclear because of the
varying questionnaires, criteria and thresholds employed, but it seems
to be highest in Asian countries and in male adolescents 12--20 years of
age. There is an abundance of reports from Asian countries, especially
China and South Korea, but fewer from Europe and North America, from
which prevalence estimates are highly variable. The point prevalence in
adolescents (ages 15--19 years) in one Asian study using a threshold of
five criteria was 8.4% for males and 4.5% for females.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental.

Computer availability with Internet connection allows access to the
types of games with which Internet gaming disorder is most often
associated.

Genetic and physiological.

Adolescent males seem to be at greatest risk of developing Internet
gaming disorder, and it has been speculated that Asian environmental
and/or genetic background is another risk factor, but this remains
unclear.

Functional Consequences of Internet Gaming Disorder

Internet gaming disorder may lead to school failure, job loss, or
marriage failure. The compulsive gaming behavior tends to crowd out
normal social, scholastic, and family activities.

Students may show declining grades and eventually failure in school.
Family responsibilities may be neglected.

Differential Diagnosis

Excessive use of the Internet not involving playing of online games
(e.g., excessive use of social media, such as Facebook; viewing
pornography online) is not considered analogous

[]{#index_split_118.html#p843}**798**

Conditions for Further Study

to Internet gaming disorder, and future research on other excessive uses
of the Internet would need to follow similar guidelines as suggested
herein. Excessive gambling online may qualify for a separate diagnosis
of gambling disorder.

Comorbidity

Health may be neglected due to compulsive gaming. Other diagnoses that
may be associated with Internet gaming disorder include major depressive
disorder, ADHD, and OCD.

Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated

With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure

Proposed Criteria

A. More than minimal exposure to alcohol during gestation, including
prior to pregnancy recognition. Confirmation of gestational exposure to
alcohol may be obtained from maternal self-report of alcohol use in
pregnancy, medical or other records, or clinical observation.

B. Impaired neurocognitive functioning as manifested by one or more of
the following: 1. Impairment in global intellectual performance (i.e.,
IQ of 70 or below, or a standard score of 70 or below on a comprehensive
developmental assessment).

2\. Impairment in executive functioning (e.g., poor planning and
organization; inflexibility; difficulty with behavioral inhibition).

3\. Impairment in learning (e.g., lower academic achievement than
expected for intellectual level; specific learning disability).

4\. Memory impairment (e.g., problems remembering information learned
recently; repeatedly making the same mistakes; difficulty remembering
lengthy verbal instructions).

5\. Impairment in visual-spatial reasoning (e.g., disorganized or poorly
planned drawings or constructions; problems differentiating left from
right).

C. Impaired self-regulation as manifested by one or more of the
following: 1. Impairment in mood or behavioral regulation (e.g., mood
lability; negative affect or irritability; frequent behavioral
outbursts).

2\. Attention deficit (e.g., difficulty shifting attention; difficulty
sustaining mental effort).

3\. Impairment in impulse control (e.g., difficulty waiting turn;
difficulty complying with rules).

D. Impairment in adaptive functioning as manifested by two or more of
the following, one of which must be (1) or (2):

1\. Communication deficit (e.g., delayed acquisition of language;
difficulty understanding spoken language).

2\. Impairment in social communication and interaction (e.g., overly
friendly with strangers; difficulty reading social cues; difficulty
understanding social consequences).

3\. Impairment in daily living skills (e.g., delayed toileting, feeding,
or bathing; difficulty managing daily schedule).

4\. Impairment in motor skills (e.g., poor fine motor development;
delayed attainment of gross motor milestones or ongoing deficits in
gross motor function; deficits in coordination and balance).

E. Onset of the disorder (symptoms in Criteria B, C, and D) occurs in
childhood.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p844}Conditions for Further Study

**799**

F. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

G. The disorder is not better explained by the direct physiological
effects associated with postnatal use of a substance (e.g., a
medication, alcohol or other drugs), a general medical condition (e.g.,
traumatic brain injury, delirium, dementia), another known teratogen
(e.g., fetal hydantoin syndrome), a genetic condition (e.g., Williams
syndrome, Down syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome), or environmental
neglect.

Alcohol is a neurobehavioral teratogen, and prenatal alcohol exposure
has teratogenic effects on central nervous system (CNS) development and
subsequent function. *Neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal
alcohol exposure* (ND-PAE) is a new clarifying term, intended to
encompass the full range of developmental disabilities associated with
exposure to alcohol in utero. The current diagnostic guidelines allow
ND-PAE to be diagnosed both in the absence and in the presence of the
physical effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (e.g., facial
dysmorphology required for a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome).

Diagnostic Features

The essential features of ND-PAE are the manifestation of impairment in
neurocognitive, behavioral, and adaptive functioning associated with
prenatal alcohol exposure. Impairment can be documented based on past
diagnostic evaluations (e.g., psychological or educational assessments)
or medical records, reports by the individual or informants, and/

or observation by a clinician.

A clinical diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome, including specific
prenatal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology and growth retardation,
can be used as evidence of significant levels of prenatal alcohol
exposure. Although both animal and human studies have documented adverse
effects of lower levels of drinking, identifying how much prenatal
exposure is needed to significantly impact neurodevelopmental outcome
remains challenging. Data suggest that a history of more than minimal
gestational exposure (e.g., more than light drinking) prior to pregnancy
recognition and/or following pregnancy recognition may be required.
Light drinking is defined as 1--13 drinks per month during pregnancy
with no more than 2 of these drinks consumed on any 1 drinking occasion.
Identifying a minimal threshold of drinking during pregnancy will
require consideration of a variety of factors known to affect exposure
and/or interact to influence developmental outcomes, including stage of
prenatal development, gestational smoking, maternal and fetal genetics,
and maternal physical status (i.e., age, health, and certain obstetric
problems).

Symptoms of ND-PAE include marked impairment in global intellectual
performance (IQ) or neurocognitive impairments in any of the following
areas: executive functioning, learning, memory, and/or visual-spatial
reasoning. Impairments in self-regulation are present and may include
impairment in mood or behavioral regulation, attention deficit, or
impairment in impulse control. Finally, impairments in adaptive
functioning include communication deficits and impairment in social
communication and interaction. Impairment in daily living (self-help)
skills and impairment in motor skills may be present. As it may be
difficult to obtain an accurate assessment of the neurocognitive
abilities of very young children, it is appropriate to defer a diagnosis
for children 3 years of age and younger.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Associated features vary depending on age, degree of alcohol exposure,
and the individual's environment. An individual can be diagnosed with
this disorder regardless of socioeconomic or cultural background.
However, ongoing parental alcohol/substance misuse, parental mental
illness, exposure to domestic or community violence, neglect or abuse,
disrupted caregiving relationships, multiple out-of-home placements, and
lack of continuity in medical or mental health care are often present.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p845}**800**

Conditions for Further Study

Prevalence

The prevalence rates of ND-PAE are unknown. However, estimated
prevalence rates of clinical conditions associated with prenatal alcohol
exposure are 2%--5% in the United States.

Development and Course

Among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure, evidence of CNS
dysfunction varies according to developmental stage. Although about
one-half of young children prenatally exposed to alcohol show marked
developmental delay in the first 3 years of life, other children
affected by prenatal alcohol exposure may not exhibit signs of CNS
dysfunction until they are preschool-or school-age. Additionally,
impairments in higher order cognitive processes (i.e., executive
functioning), which are often associated with prenatal alcohol exposure,
may be more easily assessed in older children. When children reach
school age, learning difficulties, impairment in executive function, and
problems with integrative language functions usually emerge more
clearly, and both social skills deficits and challenging behavior may
become more evident. In particular, as school and other requirements
become more complex, greater deficits are noted. Because of this, the
school years represent the ages at which a diagnosis of ND-PAE would be
most likely.

Suicide Risk

Suicide is a high-risk outcome, with rates increasing significantly in
late adolescence and early adulthood.

Functional Consequences of Neurobehavioral Disorder

Associated With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure

The CNS dysfunction seen in individuals with ND-PAE often leads to
decrements in adaptive behavior and to maladaptive behavior with
lifelong consequences. Individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure
have a higher prevalence of disrupted school experiences, poor
employment records, trouble with the law, confinement (legal or
psychiatric), and dependent living conditions.

Differential Diagnosis

Disorders that are attributable to the physiological effects associated
with postnatal use of a substance, another medical condition, or
environmental neglect.

Other considerations include the physiological effects of postnatal
substance use, such as a medication, alcohol, or other substances;
disorders due to another medical condition, such as traumatic brain
injury or other neurocognitive disorders (e.g., delirium, major
neurocognitive disorder \[dementia\]); or environmental neglect.

Genetic and teratogenic conditions.

Genetic conditions such as Williams syndrome,

Down syndrome, or Cornelia de Lange syndrome and other teratogenic
conditions such as fetal hydantoin syndrome and maternal phenylketonuria
may have similar physical and behavioral characteristics. A careful
review of prenatal exposure history is needed to clarify the teratogenic
agent, and an evaluation by a clinical geneticist may be needed to
distinguish physical characteristics associated with these and other
genetic conditions.

Comorbidity

Mental health problems have been identified in more than 90% of
individuals with histories of significant prenatal alcohol exposure. The
most common co-occurring diagnosis is attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, but research has shown that individuals with ND-PAE differ in
neuropsychological characteristics and in their responsiveness to phar-

**801**

macological interventions. Other high-probability co-occurring disorders
include oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, but the
appropriateness of these diagnoses should be weighed in the context of
the significant impairments in general intellectual and executive
functioning that are often associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.
Mood symptoms, including symptoms of bipolar disorder and depressive
disorders, have been described. History of prenatal alcohol exposure is
associated with an increased risk for later tobacco, alcohol, and other
substance use disorders.

Suicidal Behavior Disorder

Proposed Criteria

A. Within the last 24 months, the individual has made a suicide attempt.

**Note:** A suicide attempt is a self-initiated sequence of behaviors by
an individual who, at the time of initiation, expected that the set of
actions would lead to his or her own death. The "time of initiation" is
the time when a behavior took place that involved applying the method.)

B. The act does not meet criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury---that is,
it does not involve self-injury directed to the surface of the body
undertaken to induce relief from a negative feeling/cognitive state or
to achieve a positive mood state.

C. The diagnosis is not applied to suicidal ideation or to preparatory
acts.

D. The act was not initiated during a state of delirium or confusion.

E. The act was not undertaken solely for a political or religious
objective.

*Specify* if:

**Current:** Not more than 12 months since the last attempt.

**In early remission:** 12--24 months since the last attempt.

Specifiers

Suicidal behavior is often categorized in terms of violence of the
method. Generally, overdoses with legal or illegal substances are
considered nonviolent in method, whereas jumping, gunshot wounds, and
other methods are considered violent. Another dimension for
classification is medical consequences of the behavior, with
high-lethality attempts being defined as those requiring medical
hospitalization beyond a visit to an emergency department. An additional
dimension considered includes the degree of planning versus
impulsiveness of the attempt, a characteristic that might have
consequences for the medical outcome of a suicide attempt.

If the suicidal behavior occurred 12--24 months prior to evaluation, the
condition is considered to be in early remission. Individuals remain at
higher risk for further suicide attempts and death in the 24 months
after a suicide attempt, and the period 12--24 months after the behavior
took place is specified as "early remission."

Diagnostic Features

The essential manifestation of suicidal behavior disorder is a suicide
attempt. A *suicide attempt* is a behavior that the individual has
undertaken with at least some intent to die. The behavior might or might
not lead to injury or serious medical consequences. Several factors can
influence the medical consequences of the suicide attempt, including
poor planning, lack of knowledge about the lethality of the method
chosen, low intentionality or ambivalence, or chance intervention by
others after the behavior has been initiated. These should not be
considered in assigning the diagnosis.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p847}**802**

Conditions for Further Study

Determining the degree of intent can be challenging. Individuals might
not acknowledge intent, especially in situations where doing so could
result in hospitalization or cause distress to loved ones. Markers of
risk include degree of planning, including selection of a time and place
to minimize rescue or interruption; the individual's mental state at the
time of the behavior, with acute agitation being especially concerning;
recent discharge from inpatient care; or recent discontinuation of a
mood stabilizer such as lithium or an antipsychotic such as clozapine in
the case of schizophrenia. Examples of environmental "triggers" include
recently learning of a potentially fatal medical diagnosis such as
cancer, experiencing the sudden and unexpected loss of a close relative
or partner, loss of employment, or displacement from housing.
Conversely, features such as talking to others about future events or
preparedness to sign a contract for safety are less reliable indicators.

In order for the criteria to be met, the individual must have made at
least one suicide attempt. Suicide attempts can include behaviors in
which, after initiating the suicide attempt, the individual changed his
or her mind or someone intervened. For example, an individual might
intend to ingest a given amount of medication or poison, but either stop
or be stopped by another before ingesting the full amount. If the
individual is dissuaded by another or changes his or her mind before
initiating the behavior, the diagnosis should not be made.

The act must not meet criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury---that is, it
should not involve repeated (at least five times within the past 12
months) self-injurious episodes undertaken to induce relief from a
negative feeling/cognitive state or to achieve a positive mood state.
The act should not have been initiated during a state of delirium or
confusion. If the individual deliberately became intoxicated before
initiating the behavior, to reduce anticipatory anxiety and to minimize
interference with the intended behavior, the diagnosis should be made.

Development and Course

Suicidal behavior can occur at any time in the lifespan but is rarely
seen in children under the age of 5. In prepubertal children, the
behavior will often consist of a behavior (e.g., sitting on a ledge)
that a parent has forbidden because of the risk of accident.
Approximately 25%--30% of persons who attempt suicide will go on to make
more attempts.There is significant variability in terms of frequency,
method, and lethality of attempts. However, this is not different from
what is observed in other illnesses, such as major depressive disorder,
in which frequency of episode, subtype of episode, and impairment for a
given episode can vary significantly.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Suicidal behavior varies in frequency and form across cultures. Cultural
differences might be due to method availability (e.g., poisoning with
pesticides in developing countries; gunshot wounds in the southwestern
United States) or the presence of culturally specific syndromes (e.g.,
*ataques de nervios,* which in some Latino groups might lead to
behaviors that closely resemble suicide attempts or might facilitate
suicide attempts).

Diagnostic Markers

Laboratory abnormalities consequent to the suicidal attempt are often
evident. Suicidal behavior that leads to blood loss can be accompanied
by anemia, hypotension, or shock.

Overdoses might lead to coma or obtundation and associated laboratory
abnormalities such as electrolyte imbalances.

Functional Consequences of Suicidal Behavior Disorder Medical conditions
(e.g., lacerations or skeletal trauma, cardiopulmonary instability,
inhalation of vomit and suffocation, hepatic failure consequent to use
of paracetamol) can occur as a consequence of suicidal behavior.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p848}Conditions for Further Study

**803**

Comorbidity

Suicidal behavior is seen in the context of a variety of mental
disorders, most commonly bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder,
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, anxiety disorders (in
particular, panic disorders associated with catastrophic content and
PTSD

flashbacks), substance use disorders (especially alcohol use disorders),
borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, eating
disorders, and adjustment disorders. It is rarely manifested by
individuals with no discernible pathology, unless it is undertaken
because of a painful medical condition with the intention of drawing
attention to martyrdom for political or religious reasons, or in
partners in a suicide pact, both of which are excluded from this
diagnosis, or when third-party informants wish to conceal the nature of
the behavior.

Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

Proposed Criteria

A. In the last year, the individual has, on 5 or more days, engaged in
intentional self-inflicted damage to the surface of his or her body of a
sort likely to induce bleeding, bruising, or pain (e.g., cutting,
burning, stabbing, hitting, excessive rubbing), with the expectation
that the injury will lead to only minor or moderate physical harm (i.e.,
there is no suicidal intent).

**Note:** The absence of suicidal intent has either been stated by the
individual or can be inferred by the individual's repeated engagement in
a behavior that the individual knows, or has learned, is not likely to
result in death.

B. The individual engages in the self-injurious behavior with one or
more of the following expectations:

1\. To obtain relief from a negative feeling or cognitive state.

2\. To resolve an interpersonal difficulty.

3\. To induce a positive feeling state.

**Note:** The desired relief or response is experienced during or
shortly after the self-injury, and the individual may display patterns
of behavior suggesting a dependence on repeatedly engaging in it.

C. The intentional self-injury is associated with at least one of the
following: 1. Interpersonal difficulties or negative feelings or
thoughts, such as depression, anxiety, tension, anger, generalized
distress, or self-criticism, occurring in the period immediately prior
to the self-injurious act.

2\. Prior to engaging in the act, a period of preoccupation with the
intended behavior that is difficult to control.

3\. Thinking about self-injury that occurs frequently, even when it is
not acted upon.

D. The behavior is not socially sanctioned (e.g., body piercing,
tattooing, part of a religious or cultural ritual) and is not restricted
to picking a scab or nail biting.

E. The behavior or its consequences cause clinically significant
distress or interference in interpersonal, academic, or other important
areas of functioning.

F. The behavior does not occur exclusively during psychotic episodes,
delirium, substance intoxication, or substance withdrawal. In
individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder, the behavior is not part
of a pattern of repetitive stereotypies. The behavior is not better
explained by another mental disorder or medical condition (e.g.,
psychotic disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability,
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, stereotypic movement disorder with self-injury,
trichotillomania \[hair-pulling disorder\], excoriation \[skin-picking\]
disorder).

[]{#index_split_118.html#p849}**804**

Conditions for Further Study

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of nonsuicidal self-injury is that the individual
repeatedly inflicts shallow, yet painful injuries to the surface of his
or her body. Most commonly, the purpose is to reduce negative emotions,
such as tension, anxiety, and self-reproach, and/or to resolve an
interpersonal difficulty. In some cases, the injury is conceived of as a
deserved self-punishment. The individual will often report an immediate
sensation of relief that occurs during the process. When the behavior
occurs frequently, it might be associated with a sense of urgency and
craving, the resultant behavioral pattern resembling an addiction.

The inflicted wounds can become deeper and more numerous.

The injury is most often inflicted with a knife, needle, razor, or other
sharp object. Common areas for injury include the frontal area of the
thighs and the dorsal side of the forearm.

A single session of injury might involve a series of superficial,
parallel cuts---separated by 1 or 2 centimeters---on a visible or
accessible location. The resulting cuts will often bleed and will
eventually leave a characteristic pattern of scars.

Other methods used include stabbing an area, most often the upper arm,
with a needle or sharp, pointed knife; inflicting a superficial burn
with a lit cigarette end; or burning the skin by repeated rubbing with
an eraser. Engagement in nonsuicidal self-injury with multiple methods
is associated with more severe psychopathology, including engagement in
suicide attempts.

The great majority of individuals who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury
do not seek clinical attention. It is not known if this reflects
frequency of engagement in the disorder, because accurate reporting is
seen as stigmatizing, or because the behaviors are experienced
positively by the individual who engages in them, who is unmotivated to
receive treatment. Young children might experiment with these behaviors
but not experience relief. In such cases, youths often report that the
procedure is painful or distressing and might then discontinue the
practice.

Development and Course

Nonsuicidal self-injury most often starts in the early teen years and
can continue for many years. Admission to hospital for nonsuicidal
self-injury reaches a peak at 20--29 years of age and then declines.
However, research that has examined age at hospitalization did not
provide information on age at onset of the behavior, and prospective
research is needed to outline the natural history of nonsuicidal
self-injury and the factors that promote or inhibit its course.
Individuals often learn of the behavior on the recommendation or
observation of another. Research has shown that when an individual who
engages in nonsuicidal self-injury is admitted to an inpatient unit,
other individuals may begin to engage in the behavior.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Male and female prevalence rates of nonsuicidal self-injury are closer
to each other than in suicidal behavior disorder, in which the
female-to-male ratio is about 3:1 or 4:1.

Two theories of psychopathology---based on functional behavioral
analyses---have been proposed: In the first, based on learning theory,
either positive or negative reinforcement sustains the behavior.
Positive reinforcement might result from punishing oneself in a way that
the individual feels is deserved, with the behavior inducing a pleasant
and relaxed state or generating attention and help from a significant
other, or as an expression of anger. Negative reinforcement results from
affect regulation and the reduction of unpleasant emotions or avoiding
distressing thoughts, including thinking about suicide. In the second
theory, nonsuicidal self-injury is thought to be a form of
self-punishment, in which self-punitive actions are engaged in to make
up for acts that caused distress or harm to others.

Functional Consequences of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

The act of cutting might be performed with shared implements, raising
the possibility of blood-borne disease transmission.

Differential Diagnosis

Borderline personality disorder.

As indicated, nonsuicidal self-injury has long been regarded as a
"symptom" of borderline personality disorder, even though comprehensive
clinical evaluations have found that most individuals with nonsuicidal
self-injury have symptoms that also meet criteria for other diagnoses,
with eating disorders and substance use disorders being especially
common. Historically, nonsuicidal self-injury was regarded as
pathognomonic of borderline personality disorder. Both conditions are
associated with several other diagnoses. Although frequently associated,
borderline personality disorder is not invariably found in individuals
with nonsuicidal self-injury. The two conditions differ in several ways.
Individuals with borderline personality disorder often manifest
disturbed aggressive and hostile behaviors, whereas nonsuicidal
self-injury is more often associated with phases of closeness,
collaborative behaviors, and positive relationships. At a more
fundamental level, there are differences in the involvement of different
neurotransmitter systems, but these will not be apparent on clinical
examination.

Suicidal behavior disorder.

The differentiation between nonsuicidal self-injury and suicidal
behavior disorder is based either on the stated goal of the behavior
being a wish to die (suicidal behavior disorder) or, in nonsuicidal
self-injury, to experience relief as described in the criteria.
Depending on the circumstances, individuals may provide reports of
convenience, and several studies report high rates of false intent
declaration. Individuals with a history of frequent nonsuicidal
self-injury episodes have learned that a session of cutting, while
painful, is, in the short-term, largely benign. Because individuals with
nonsuicidal self-injury can and do attempt and commit suicide, it is
important to check past history of suicidal behavior and to obtain
information from a third party concerning any recent change in stress
exposure and mood. Likelihood of suicide intent has been associated with
the use of multiple previous methods of self-harm.

In a follow-up study of cases of "self-harm" in males treated at one of
several multiple emergency centers in the United Kingdom, individuals
with nonsuicidal self-injury were significantly more likely to commit
suicide than other teenage individuals drawn from the same cohort.
Studies that have examined the relationship between nonsuicidal
self-injury and suicidal behavior disorder are limited by being
retrospective and failing to obtain ver-ified accounts of the method
used during previous "attempts." A significant proportion of those who
engage in nonsuicidal self-injury have responded positively when asked
if they have ever engaged in self-cutting (or their preferred means of
self-injury) with an intention to die. It is reasonable to conclude that
nonsuicidal self-injury, while not presenting a high risk for suicide
when first manifested, is an especially dangerous form of self-injurious
behavior.

This conclusion is also supported by a multisite study of depressed
adolescents who had previously failed to respond to antidepressant
medication, which noted that those with previous nonsuicidal self-injury
did not respond to cognitive-behavioral therapy, and by a study that
found that nonsuicidal self-injury is a predictor of substance
use/misuse.

Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder).

Trichotillomania is an injurious behavior confined to pulling out one's
own hair, most commonly from the scalp, eyebrows, or eyelashes.

The behavior occurs in "sessions" that can last for hours. It is most
likely to occur during a period of relaxation or distraction.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p851}**806**

Conditions for Further Study

Stereotypic self-injury.

Stereotypic self-injury, which can include head banging, self-biting, or
self-hitting, is usually associated with intense concentration or under
conditions of low external stimulation and might be associated with
developmental delay.

Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder.

Excoriation disorder occurs mainly in females and

is usually directed to picking at an area of the skin that the
individual feels is unsightly or a blemish, usually on the face or the
scalp. As in nonsuicidal self-injury, the picking is often preceded by
an urge and is experienced as pleasurable, even though the individual
realizes that he or she is harming himself or herself. It is not
associated with the use of any implement.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p854}**Highlights of Changes From**

**DSM-IV to DSM-5**

Changes made to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and texts are outlined in this
chapter in the same order in which they appear in the DSM-5
classification. This abbreviated description is intended to orient
readers to only the most significant changes in each disorder category.
An expanded description of nearly all changes (e.g., except minor text
or wording changes needed for clarity) is available online
(www.psychiatry.org/dsm5). It should also be noted that Section I
contains a description of changes pertaining to the chapter organization
in DSM-5, the multiaxial system, and the introduction of dimensional
assessments.

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

The term *mental retardation* was used in DSM-IV. However,
**intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)** is the
term that has come into common use over the past two decades among
medical, educational, and other professionals, and by the lay public and
advocacy groups. Diagnostic criteria emphasize the need for an
assessment of both cognitive capacity (IQ) and adaptive functioning.
Severity is determined by adaptive functioning rather than IQ score.

The **communication disorders,** which are newly named from DSM-IV
phonological disorder and stuttering, respectively, include **language
disorder** (which combines the previous expressive and mixed
receptive-expressive language disorders), **speech sound disorder**
(previously phonological disorder), and **childhood-onset fluency
disorder** (previously stuttering). Also included is **social
(pragmatic) communication disorder,** a new condition involving
persistent difficulties in the social uses of verbal and nonverbal
communication.

**Autism spectrum disorder** is a new DSM-5 disorder encompassing the
previous DSM-IV autistic disorder (autism), Asperger's disorder,
childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett's disorder, and pervasive
developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It is characterized by
deficits in two core domains: 1) deficits in social communication and
social interaction and 2) restricted repetitive patterns of behavior,
interests, and activities.

Several changes have been made to the diagnostic criteria for
**attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder** (ADHD). Examples have been
added to the criterion items to facilitate application across the life
span; the age at onset description has been changed (from "some
hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms that caused impairment
were present before age 7 years"

to "Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present
prior to age 12"); subtypes have been replaced with presentation
specifiers that map directly to the prior subtypes; a comorbid diagnosis
with autism spectrum disorder is now allowed; and a symptom threshold
change has been made for adults, to reflect the substantial evidence of
clinically significant ADHD impairment, with the cutoff for ADHD of five
symptoms, instead of six required for younger persons, both for
inattention and for hyperactivity and impulsivity.

**Specific learning disorder** combines the DSM-IV diagnoses of reading
disorder, mathematics disorder, disorder of written expression, and
learning disorder not otherwise specified. Learning deficits in the
areas of reading, written expression, and mathematics are coded as
separate specifiers. Acknowledgment is made in the text that specific
types of reading deficits are described internationally in various ways
as *dyslexia* and specific types of mathematics deficits as
*dyscalculia.*

**809**

[]{#index_split_118.html#p855}**810**

Highlights of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5

The following **motor disorders** are included in DSM-5: developmental
coordination disorder, stereotypic movement disorder, Tourette's
disorder, persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, provisional
tic disorder, other specified tic disorder, and unspecified tic
disorder.

The tic criteria have been standardized across all of these disorders in
this chapter.

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Two changes were made to Criterion A for **schizophrenia:** 1) the
elimination of the special attribution of bizarre delusions and
Schneiderian first-rank auditory hallucinations (e.g., two or more
voices conversing), leading to the requirement of at least two Criterion
A symptoms for any diagnosis of schizophrenia, and 2) the addition of
the requirement that at least one of the Criterion A symptoms must be
delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The DSM-IV

subtypes of schizophrenia were eliminated due to their limited
diagnostic stability, low reliability, and poor validity. Instead, a
dimensional approach to rating severity for the core symptoms of
schizophrenia is included in DSM-5 Section III to capture the important
heterogeneity in symptom type and severity expressed across individuals
with psychotic disorders.

**Schizoaffective disorder** is reconceptualized as a longitudinal
instead of a cross-sectional diagnosis---more comparable to
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, which
are bridged by this condition---and requires that a major mood episode
be present for a majority of the total disorder's duration after
Criterion A has been met. Criterion A for **delusional disorder** no
longer has the requirement that the delusions must be nonbizarre; a
specifier is now included for bizarre type delusions to provide
continuity with DSM-IV. Criteria for **catatonia** are described
uniformly across DSM-5. Furthermore, catatonia may be diagnosed with a
specifier (for depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders, including
schizophrenia), in the context of a known medical condition, or as an
other specified diagnosis.

Bipolar and Related Disorders

Diagnostic criteria for **bipolar disorders** now include both changes
in mood and changes in activity or energy. The DSM-IV diagnosis of
bipolar I disorder, mixed episodes---requiring that the individual
simultaneously meet full criteria for both mania and major depressive
episode---is replaced with a new specifier "with mixed features."
Particular conditions can now be diagnosed under **other specified
bipolar and related disorder,** including categorization for individuals
with a past history of a major depressive disorder whose symptoms meet
all criteria for hypomania except the duration criterion is not met
(i.e., the episode lasts only 2 or 3 days instead of the required 4
consecutive days or more). A second condition constituting an other
specified bipolar and related disorder variant is that too few symptoms
of hypomania are present to meet criteria for the full bipolar II
syndrome, although the duration, at least 4 consecutive days, is
sufficient. Finally, in both this chapter and in the chapter "Depressive
Disorders," an anxious distress specifier is delineated.

Depressive Disorders

To address concerns about potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment of
bipolar disorder in children, a new diagnosis, **disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder,** is included for children up to age 18 years
who exhibit persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme
behavioral dyscontrol. **Premenstrual dysphoric disorder** is now
promoted from Appendix B, "Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further
Study," in DSM-IV to the main body of DSM-5. What was referred to as
dysthymia in DSM-IV now falls under the category of **persistent
depressive** **disorder,** which includes both chronic major depressive
disorder and the previous dysthymic disorder. The coexistence within a
**major depressive episode** of at least three manic symptoms
(insufficient to satisfy criteria for a manic episode) is now
acknowledged by the specifier []{#index_split_118.html#p856}Highlights
of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5

**811**

"with mixed features." In DSM-IV, there was an exclusion criterion for a
major depressive episode that was applied to depressive symptoms lasting
less than 2 months following the death of a loved one (i.e., the
bereavement exclusion). This exclusion is omitted in DSM-5 for several
reasons, including the recognition that bereavement is a severe
psychosocial stressor that can precipitate a major depressive episode in
a vulnerable individual, generally beginning soon after the loss, and
can add an additional risk for suffering, feelings of worthlessness,
suicidal ideation, poorer medical health, and worse interpersonal and
work functioning. It was critical to remove the implication that
bereavement typically lasts only 2 months, when both physicians and
grief counselors recognize that the duration is more commonly 1--2
years. A detailed footnote has replaced the more simplistic DSM-IV
exclusion to aid clinicians in making the critical distinction between
the symptoms characteristic of bereavement and those of a major
depressive disorder. Finally, a new specifier to indicate the presence
of mixed symptoms has been added across both the bipolar and the
depressive disorders.

Anxiety Disorders

The chapter on anxiety disorders no longer includes obsessive-compulsive
disorder (which is in the new chapter "Obsessive-Compulsive and Related
Disorders") or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress
disorder (which are in the new chapter "Trauma-and Stressor-Related
Disorders"). Changes in criteria for **specific phobia** and **social
anxiety** **disorder (social phobia)** include deletion of the
requirement that individuals over age 18

years recognize that their anxiety is excessive or unreasonable.
Instead, the anxiety must be out of proportion to the actual danger or
threat in the situation, after cultural contextual factors are taken
into account. In addition, the 6-month duration is now extended to all
ages.

**Panic attacks** can now be listed as a specifier that is applicable to
all DSM-5 disorders. **Panic** **disorder** and **agoraphobia** are
unlinked in DSM-5. Thus, the former DSM-IV diagnoses of panic disorder
with agoraphobia, panic disorder without agoraphobia, and agoraphobia
without history of panic disorder are now replaced by two diagnoses,
panic disorder and agoraphobia, each with separate criteria. The
"generalized" specifier for **social anxiety disorder** has been deleted
and replaced with a "performance only" specifier. **Separation anxiety**
**disorder** and **selective mutism** are now classified as anxiety
disorders. The wording of the criteria is modified to more adequately
represent the expression of separation anxiety symptoms in adulthood.
Also, in contrast to DSM-IV, the diagnostic criteria no longer specify
that onset must be before age 18 years, and a duration
statement---"typically lasting for 6 months or more"---has been added
for adults to minimize overdiagnosis of transient fears.

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

The chapter "Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders" is new in
DSM-5. New disorders include **hoarding disorder, excoriation
(skin-picking) disorder, substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,** and **obsessive-compulsive
and** **related disorder due to another medical condition.** The DSM-IV
diagnosis of trichotillomania is now termed **trichotillomania
(hair-pulling disorder)** and has been moved from a DSM-IV
classification of impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified to
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in DSM-5. The DSM-IV "with
poor insight" specifier for **obsessive-compulsive disorder** has been
refined to allow a distinction between individuals with good or fair
insight, poor insight, and "absent insight/delusional"
obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs (i.e., complete conviction that
obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true). Analogous "insight"
specifiers have been included for body dysmorphic disorder and hoarding
disorder. A "tic-related" specifier for obsessive-compulsive disorder
has also been added, because presence of a comorbid tic disorder may
have important clinical implications. A "muscle dysmorphia" specifier
for **body dysmorphic disorder** is added to reflect a growing
literature on the diagnostic validity and clinical utility of making
this []{#index_split_118.html#p857}**812**

Highlights of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5

distinction in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder. The delusional
variant of body dysmorphic disorder (which identifies individuals who
are completely convinced that their perceived defects or flaws are truly
abnormal appearing) is no longer coded as both delusional disorder,
somatic type, and body dysmorphic disorder; in DSM-5, this presentation
is designated only as body dysmorphic disorder with the absent
insight/delusional specifier.

Individuals can also be diagnosed with **other specified
obsessive-compulsive and related** **disorder,** which can include
conditions such as body-focused repetitive behavior disorder and
obsessional jealousy, or **unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder.**

Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorders

For a diagnosis of **acute stress disorder,** qualifying traumatic
events are now explicit as to whether they were experienced directly,
witnessed, or experienced indirectly. Also, the DSM-IV Criterion A2
regarding the subjective reaction to the traumatic event (e.g.,
experiencing "fear, helplessness, or horror") has been eliminated.
**Adjustment disorders** are reconceptualized as a heterogeneous array
of stress-response syndromes that occur after exposure to a distressing
(traumatic or nontraumatic) event, rather than as a residual category
for individuals who exhibit clinically significant distress but whose
symptoms do not meet criteria for a more discrete disorder (as in
DSM-IV).

DSM-5 criteria for **PTSD** differ significantly from the DSM-IV
criteria. The stressor criterion (Criterion A) is more explicit with
regard to events that qualify as "traumatic" experiences. Also, DSM-IV
Criterion A2 (subjective reaction) has been eliminated. Whereas there
were three major symptom clusters in DSM-IV---reexperiencing,
avoidance/numbing, and arousal---there are now four symptom clusters in
DSM-5, because the avoidance/

numbing cluster is divided into two distinct clusters: avoidance and
persistent negative alterations in cognitions and mood. This latter
category, which retains most of the DSM-IV

numbing symptoms, also includes new or reconceptualized symptoms, such
as persistent negative emotional states. The final cluster---alterations
in arousal and reactivity---retains most of the DSM-IV arousal symptoms.
It also includes irritable behavior or angry outbursts and reckless or
self-destructive behavior. PTSD is now developmentally sensitive in that
diagnostic thresholds have been lowered for children and adolescents.
Furthermore, separate criteria have been added for children age 6 years
or younger with this disorder.

The DSM-IV childhood diagnosis reactive attachment disorder had two
subtypes: emotionally withdrawn/inhibited and indiscriminately
social/disinhibited. In DSM-5, these subtypes are defined as distinct
disorders: **reactive attachment disorder** and **disinhibited social
engagement disorder.**

Dissociative Disorders

Major changes in dissociative disorders in DSM-5 include the
following: 1) derealization is included in the name and symptom
structure of what previously was called depersonalization disorder
(**depersonalization/derealization disorder**); 2) dissociative fugue is
now a specifier of **dissociative amnesia** rather than a separate
diagnosis, and 3) the criteria for **dissociative identity disorder**
have been changed to indicate that symptoms of disruption of identity
may be reported as well as observed, and that gaps in the recall of
events may occur for everyday and not just traumatic events. Also,
experiences of pathological possession in some cultures are included in
the description of identity disruption.

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

In DSM-5, somatoform disorders are now referred to as **somatic symptom
and related disorders.** The DSM-5 classification reduces the number of
these disorders and subcategories to avoid problematic overlap.
Diagnoses of somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and
undifferentiated somatoform disorder have been removed. Individuals
previ-

[]{#index_split_118.html#p858}Highlights of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5

**813**

ously diagnosed with somatization disorder will usually have symptoms
that meet DSM-5

criteria for **somatic symptom disorder,** but only if they have the
maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that define the disorder,
in addition to their somatic symptoms. Because the distinction between
somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder was
arbitrary, they are merged in DSM-5 under somatic symptom disorder.
Individuals previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis who have high
health anxiety but no somatic symptoms would receive a DSM-5 diagnosis
of **illness anxiety disorder** (unless their health anxiety was better
explained by a primary anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety
disorder). Some individuals with chronic pain would be appropriately
diagnosed as having somatic symptom disorder, with predominant pain. For
others, psychological factors affecting other medical conditions or an
adjustment disorder would be more appropriate.

**Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions** is a new
mental disorder in DSM-5, having formerly been listed in the DSM-IV
chapter "Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention."
This disorder and **factitious disorder** are placed among the somatic
symptom and related disorders because somatic symptoms are predominant
in both disorders, and both are most often encountered in medical
settings. The variants of psychological factors affecting other medical
conditions are removed in favor of the stem diagnosis. Criteria for
**conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder)** have
been modified to emphasize the essential importance of the neurological
examination, and in recognition that relevant psychological factors may
not be demonstrable at the time of diagnosis. Other specified somatic
symptom disorder, other specified illness anxiety disorder, and
pseudocyesis are now the only exemplars of the **other specified
somatic** **symptom and related disorder** classification.

Feeding and Eating Disorders

Because of the elimination of the DSM-IV-TR chapter "Disorders Usually
First Diagnosed During Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence," this chapter
describes several disorders found in the DSM-IV section "Feeding and
Eating Disorders of Infancy or Early Childhood," such as **pica** and
**rumination disorder.** The DSM-IV category feeding disorder of infancy
or early childhood has been renamed **avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder,** and the criteria are significantly expanded. The core
diagnostic criteria for **anorexia nervosa** are conceptually unchanged
from DSM-IV with one exception: the requirement for amenorrhea is
eliminated. As in DSM-IV, individuals with this disorder are required by
Criterion A to be at a significantly low body weight for their
developmental stage. The wording of the criterion is changed for
clarification, and guidance regarding how to judge whether an individual
is at or below a significantly low weight is provided in the text. In
DSM-5, Criterion B is expanded to include not only overtly expressed
fear of weight gain but also persistent behavior that interferes with
weight gain. The only change in the DSM-IV criteria for **bulimia
nervosa** is a reduction in the required minimum average frequency of
binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behavior frequency from
twice to once weekly. The extensive research that followed the
prom-ulgation of preliminary criteria for **binge-eating disorder** in
Appendix B of DSM-IV

documented the clinical utility and validity of binge-eating disorder.
The only significant difference from the preliminary criteria is that
the minimum average frequency of binge eating required for diagnosis is
once weekly over the last 3 months, identical to the frequency criterion
for bulimia nervosa (rather than at least 2 days a week for 6 months in
DSM-IV).

Elimination Disorders

There have been no significant changes in this diagnostic class from
DSM-IV to DSM-5.

The disorders in this chapter were previously classified under disorders
usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence in DSM-IV
and exist now as an independent classification in DSM-5.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p859}**814**

Highlights of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5

Sleep-Wake Disorders

In DSM-5, the DSM-IV diagnoses named sleep disorder related to another
mental disorder and sleep disorder related to another medical condition
have been removed, and instead greater specification of coexisting
conditions is provided for each sleep-wake disorder. The diagnosis of
primary insomnia has been renamed **insomnia disorder** to avoid the
differentiation between primary and secondary insomnia. DSM-5 also
distinguishes **narcolepsy**--- now known to be associated with
hypocretin deficiency---from other forms of hypersomnolence
(hypersomnolence disorder). Finally, throughout the DSM-5 classification
of sleep-wake disorders, pediatric and developmental criteria and text
are integrated where existing science and considerations of clinical
utility support such integration. **Breathing-related** **sleep
disorders** are divided into three relatively distinct disorders:
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related
hypoventilation. The subtypes of **circadian** **rhythm sleep
disorders** are expanded to include advanced sleep phase type and
irregular sleep-wake type, whereas the jet lag type has been removed.
The use of the former "not otherwise specified" diagnoses in DSM-IV have
been reduced by elevating **rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder**
and **restless legs syndrome** to independent disorders.

Sexual Dysfunctions

In DSM-5, some gender-specific sexual dysfunctions have been added, and,
for females, sexual desire and arousal disorders have been combined into
one disorder: **female sexual** **interest/arousal disorder.** All of
the sexual dysfunctions (except **substance/medication-induced sexual
dysfunction**) now require a minimum duration of approximately 6 months
and more precise severity criteria. **Genito-pelvic pain/penetration
disorder** has been added to DSM-5 and represents a merging of
vaginismus and dyspareunia, which were highly comorbid and difficult to
distinguish. The diagnosis of sexual aversion disorder has been removed
due to rare use and lack of supporting research.

There are now only two subtypes for sexual dysfunctions: **lifelong**
versus **acquired** and **generalized** versus **situational.** To
indicate the presence and degree of medical and other nonmedical
correlates, the following **associated features** have been added to the
text: partner factors, relationship factors, individual vulnerability
factors, cultural or religious factors, and medical factors.

Gender Dysphoria

**Gender dysphoria** is a new diagnostic class in DSM-5 and reflects a
change in conceptualization of the disorder's defining features by
emphasizing the phenomenon of "gender incongruence" rather than
cross-gender identification per se, as was the case in DSM-IV gender
identity disorder. Gender dysphoria includes separate sets of criteria:
for children and for adults and adolescents. For the adolescents and
adults criteria, the previous Criterion A (cross-gender identification)
and Criterion B (aversion toward one's gender) are merged. In the
wording of the criteria, "the other sex" is replaced by "the other
gender" (or "some alternative gender")." *Gender* instead of *sex* is
used systematically because the concept "sex" is inadequate when
referring to individuals with a disorder of sex development. In the
child criteria, "strong desire to be of the other gender" replaces the
previous "repeatedly stated desire to be\...the other sex" to capture
the situation of some children who, in a coercive environment, may not
verbalize the desire to be of another gender. For children, Criterion A1
("a strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that he or
she is the other gender.. .)"

is now necessary (but not sufficient), which makes the diagnosis more
restrictive and conservative. The subtyping on the basis of sexual
orientation is removed because the distinction is no longer considered
clinically useful. A **posttransition specifier** has been added to
identify

[]{#index_split_118.html#p860}Highlights of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5

**815**

individuals who have undergone at least one medical procedure or
treatment to support the new gender assignment (e.g., cross-sex hormone
treatment). Although the concept of posttransition is modeled on the
concept of full or partial remission, the term *remission* has
implications in terms of symptom reduction that do not apply directly to
gender dysphoria.

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

The chapter "Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders" is new
to DSM-5 and combines disorders that were previously included in the
chapter "Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or
Adolescence" (i.e., oppositional defiant disorder; conduct disorder; and
disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified, now categorized as
other specified and unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct
disorders) and the chapter "Impulse-Control Disorders Not Elsewhere
Classified" (i.e., intermittent explosive disorder, pyromania, and
kleptomania). These disorders are all characterized by problems in
emotional and behavioral self-control. Notably, ADHD is frequently
comorbid with the disorders in this chapter but is listed with the
neurodevelopmental disorders. Because of its close association with
conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder is listed both in this
chapter and in the chapter "Personality Disorders," where it is
described in detail.

The criteria for **oppositional defiant disorder** are now grouped into
three types: angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, and
vindictiveness. Additionally, the exclusionary criterion for conduct
disorder has been removed. The criteria for **conduct** **disorder**
include a descriptive features specifier for individuals who meet full
criteria for the disorder but also present with **limited prosocial
emotions.** The primary change in **intermittent explosive disorder** is
in the type of aggressive outbursts that should be considered: DSM-IV
required physical aggression, whereas in DSM-5 verbal aggression and
nondestructive/noninjurious physical aggression also meet criteria.
DSM-5 also provides more specific criteria defining frequency needed to
meet the criteria and specifies that the aggressive outbursts are
impulsive and/or anger based in nature, and must cause marked distress,
cause impairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or be
associated with negative financial or legal consequences. Furthermore, a
minimum age of 6 years (or equivalent developmental level) is now
required.

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

An important departure from past diagnostic manuals is that the chapter
on substance-related disorders has been expanded to include **gambling
disorder**. Another key change is that DSM-5 does not separate the
diagnoses of substance *abuse* and *dependence* as in DSM-IV. Rather
criteria are provided for **substance use disorder,** accompanied by
criteria for intoxication, withdrawal, substance-induced disorders, and
unspecified substance-related disorders, where relevant. Within
substance use disorders, the DSM-IV recurrent substance-related legal
problems criterion has been deleted from DSM-5, and a new
criterion---craving, or a strong desire or urge to use a substance---has
been added. In addition, the threshold for substance use disorder
diagnosis in DSM-5 is set at two or more criteria, in contrast to a
threshold of one or more criteria for a diagnosis of DSM-IV substance
abuse and three or more for DSM-IV dependence. **Cannabis withdrawal**
and **caffeine withdrawal** are new disorders (the latter was in DSM-IV
Appendix B, "Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study").

**Severity** of the DSM-5 substance use disorders is based on the number
of criteria endorsed. The DSM-IV specifier for a physiological subtype
is eliminated in DSM-5, as is the DSM-IV diagnosis of polysubstance
dependence. Early remission from a DSM-5 substance use disorder is
defined as at least 3 but less than 12 months without meeting substance
use disorder criteria (except craving), and sustained remission is
defined as at least 12 months without meeting criteria (except craving).
Additional new DSM-5 specifiers include **"in a** **controlled
environment"** and **"on maintenance therapy"** as the situation
warrants.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p861}**816**

Highlights of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5

Neurocognitive Disorders

The DSM-IV diagnoses of dementia and amnestic disorder are subsumed
under the newly named entity **major neurocognitive disorder** (NCD).
The term *dementia* is not precluded from use in the etiological
subtypes where that term is standard. Furthermore, DSM-5 now recognizes
a less severe level of cognitive impairment, **mild NCD,** which is a
new disorder that permits the diagnosis of less disabling syndromes that
may nonetheless be the focus of concern and treatment. Diagnostic
criteria are provided for both of these disorders, followed by
diagnostic criteria for different **etiological subtypes.** In DSM-IV,
individual diagnoses were designated for dementia of the Alzheimer's
type, vascular dementia, and substance-induced dementia, whereas the
other neurodegenerative disorders were classified as dementia due to
another medical condition, with HIV, head trauma, Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's disease, Pick's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and
other medical conditions specified. In DSM-5, major or mild NCD due to
Alzheimer's disease and major or mild vascular NCD have been retained,
while new separate criteria are now presented for major or mild
frontotemporal NCD, NCD with Lewy bodies, and NCDs due to traumatic
brain injury, a substance/medication, HIV infection, prion disease,
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, another medical condition,
and multiple etiologies, respectively. Unspecified NCD is also included
as a diagnosis.

Personality Disorders

The criteria for personality disorders in Section II of DSM-5 have not
changed from those in DSM-IV. An alternative approach to the diagnosis
of personality disorders was developed for DSM-5 for further study and
can be found in Section III (see "Alternative DSM-5 Model for
Personality Disorders"). For the **general criteria for personality
disorder,** presented in Section III, a revised personality functioning
criterion (Criterion A) has been developed based on a literature review
of reliable clinical measures of core impairments central to personality
pathology. A diagnosis of **personality disorder---trait specified,**
based on moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning and
the presence of pathological personality traits, replaces personality
disorder not otherwise specified and provides a much more informative
diagnosis for individuals who are not optimally described as having a
specific personality disorder. A greater emphasis on personality
functioning and trait-based criteria increases the stability and
empirical bases of the disorders. **Personality functioning** and
**personality traits** also can be assessed whether or not the
individual has a personality disorder---a feature that provides
clinically useful information about all individuals.

Paraphilic Disorders

An overarching change from DSM-IV is the addition of the course
specifiers **"in a controlled** **environment"** and **"in remission"**
to the diagnostic criteria sets for all the paraphilic disorders. These
specifiers are added to indicate important changes in an individual's
status. In DSM-5, paraphilias are not *ipso facto* mental disorders.
There is a distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders. A
*paraphilic disorder* is a paraphilia that is currently causing distress
or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has
entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, to others. A paraphilia is a
necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic
disorder, and a paraphilia by itself does not automatically justify or
require clinical intervention. The **distinction between paraphilias and
paraphilic disorders** was implemented without making any changes to the
basic structure of the diagnostic criteria as they had existed since
DSM-III-R. The change proposed for DSM-5 is that individuals who meet
both Criterion A and Criterion B would now be diagnosed as having a
paraphilic disorder. A diagnosis would not be given to individuals whose
symptoms meet Criterion A but not Criterion B---that is, to individuals
who have a paraphilia but not a paraphilic disorder.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p862}**Glossary of**

**Technical Terms**

**affect**

A pattern of observable behaviors that is the expression of a
subjectively experienced feeling state (emotion). Examples of affect
include sadness, elation, and anger. In contrast to *mood,* which refers
to a pervasive and sustained emotional "climate," *affect* refers to
more fluctuating changes in emotional "weather." What is considered the
normal range of the expression of affect varies considerably, both
within and among different cultures. Disturbances in affect include
**blunted** Significant reduction in the intensity of emotional
expression.

**flat** Absence or near absence of any sign of affective expression.

**inappropriate** Discordance between affective expression and the
content of speech or ideation.

**labile** Abnormal variability in affect with repeated, rapid, and
abrupt shifts in affective expression.

**restricted or constricted** Mild reduction in the range and intensity
of emotional expression.

**affective blunting**

*See* AFFECT.

**agitation (psychomotor)**

*See* PSYCHOMOTOR AGITATION.

**agnosia**

Loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells
that occurs in the absence of either impairment of the specific sense or
significant memory loss.

**alogia**

An impoverishment in thinking that is inferred from observing speech and
language behavior. There may be brief and concrete replies to questions
and restriction in the amount of spontaneous speech (termed *poverty of
speech*). Sometimes the speech is adequate in amount but conveys little
information because it is overconcrete, overab-stract, repetitive, or
stereotyped (termed *poverty of content*).

**amnesia**

acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the
individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or
according to rules that must be applied rigidly. The behaviors or mental
acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or distress, or
preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or
mental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are
designed to neutralize or prevent or are clearly excessive.

**conversion symptom**

their severity, their inflexibility, and the context in which they
occur.

**delusion**

A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that
is firmly held despite what almost everyone else believes and despite
what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the
contrary. The belief is not ordinarily accepted by other members of the
person's culture or subculture (i.e., it is not an article of religious
faith). When a false belief involves a value judgment, it is regarded as
a delusion only when the judgment is so extreme as to defy credibility.
Delusional conviction can sometimes be inferred from an overvalued idea
(in which case the individual has an unreasonable belief or idea but
does not hold it as firmly as is the case with a delusion). Delusions

thoughts, or actions are experienced as being under the control of some
external force rather than being under one's own control.

**of reference** A delusion in which events, objects, or other persons
in one's immediate environment are seen as having a particular and
unusual significance. These delusions are usually of a negative or
pejorative nature but also may be grandiose in content. A delusion of
reference differs from an *idea of reference,* in which the false belief
is not as firmly held nor as fully organized into a true belief.

**persecutory** A delusion in which the central theme is that one (or
someone to whom one is close) is being attacked, harassed, cheated,
persecuted, or conspired against.

DOMAINS defined in Section III "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality
Disorders."

**disinhibition**

remaining unconscious of the contradiction. An extreme manifestation of
dissociation is dissociative identity disorder, in which a person may
exhibit several independent personalities, each unaware of the others.

languor, lassitude, and listlessness) usually associated with a
weakening or depletion of one's physical and/or mental resources,
ranging from a general state of lethargy to a specific, work-induced
burning sensation within one's muscles. Physical fatigue leads to an
inability to continue functioning at one's normal level of activity.
Although widespread in everyday life, this state usually becomes
particularly noticeable during heavy exercise. Mental fatigue, by
contrast, most often manifests as SOMNOLENCE (sleepiness).

**fear**

an actual external stimulus is misperceived or misinterpreted. The
person may or may not have insight into the non-veridical nature of the
hallucination. One hallucinating person may recognize the false sensory
experience, whereas another may be convinced that the experience is
grounded in reality. The term *hallucination* is not ordinarily applied
to the false perceptions that occur during dreaming, while falling
asleep ( *hypnagogic*), or upon awakening ( *hypnopompic*). Transient

**incoherence**

Speech or thinking that is essentially incomprehensible to others
because word or phrases are joined together without a logical or
meaningful connection. This disturbance occurs *within* clauses, in
contrast to derailment, in which the disturbance is *between* clauses.
This has sometimes been referred to a "word salad" to convey the degree
of linguistic disorganization. Mildly ungrammatical constructions or
idiomatic usages characteristic of a particular regional or cultural
backgrounds, lack of education, or low intelligence should not be
considered incoherence. The term is generally not applied when there is
evidence that the disturbance in speech is due to an aphasia.

during hypomanic or manic episodes, and vice versa).

**mood**

A pervasive and sustained emotion that colors the perception of the
world. Common examples of mood include depression, elation, anger, and
anxiety. In contrast to *affect,* which refers to more fluctuating
changes in emotional "weather," mood refers to a pervasive and sustained
emotional "climate." Types of mood include **dysphoric** An unpleasant
mood, such as sadness, anxiety, or irritability.

**elevated** An exaggerated feeling of well-being, or euphoria or
elation. A person with elevated mood may describe feeling "high,"
"ecstatic," "on top of the world,"

hallucinations would not involve themes of inflated worth, power,
knowledge, or identity, or a special relationship to a deity or a famous
person.

not better accounted for by external influences such as changes in the
individual's sleep-wake cycle or by local social norms.

**nightmare disorder**

Repeated occurrences of extended, extremely dysphoric, and
well-remembered dreams that usually involve efforts to avoid threats to
survival, security or physical integrity and that generally occur during
the second half of the major sleep episode. On awakening from the

**panic attacks**

Discrete periods of sudden onset of intense fear or terror, often
associated with feelings of impending doom. During these attacks there
are symptoms such as shortness of breath or smothering sensations;
palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; chest pain or
discomfort; choking; and fear of going crazy or losing control. Panic
attacks may be unexpected, in which the onset of the attack is not
associated with an obvious trigger and instead occurs "out of the blue,"
or expected, in which the panic attack is associated with an obvious

In Section III "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders," a
proposed diagnostic category for use when a personality disorder is
considered present but the criteria for a specific disorder are not met.
Personality disorder---trait specified (PD-TS) is defined by significant
impairment in personality functioning, as measured by the Level of
Personality Functioning Scale and one or more pathological PERSONALITY
TRAIT DOMAINS or PERSONALITY TRAIT FACETS. PD-TS is proposed in DSM-5
Section III for further study as a possible future replacement for other
specified personality disorder and unspecified personality disorder.

**personality functioning**

Cognitive models of self and others that shape patterns of emotional and
affiliative engagement.

**personality trait**

A tendency to behave, feel, perceive, and think in relatively consistent
ways across time and across situations in which the trait may be

Personality Disorders," personality traits are organized into five broad
domains: NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY, DETACHMENT, ANTAGONISM, DISINHIBITION,
and PSYCHOTICISM. Within these five broad trait domains are 25 specific
personality trait facets (e.g., IMPULSIVITY, RIGID PERFECTIONISM).

**phobia**

A persistent fear of a specific object, activity, or situation (i.e.,
the phobic stimulus) out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the
specific object or situation that results in a compelling desire to
avoid it. If it cannot be avoided, the phobic stimulus is endured with
marked distress.

**pica**

Persistent eating of nonnutritive nonfood substances over a period of at
least 1 month.

The eating of nonnutritive nonfood substances is inappropriate to the
developmental level of the individual (a minimum age of 2 years is
suggested for diagnosis). The eating behavior is not part of a
culturally supported or socially normative practice.

**polysomnography**

Polysomnography (PSG), also known as a sleep study, is a
multipa-rametric test used in the study of sleep and as a diagnostic
tool in sleep medicine. The test result is called a *polysomnogram,*
also abbreviated PSG. PSG monitors many body functions, including brain
(electroencephalography), eye movements (electro-oculog-raphy), muscle
activity or skeletal muscle activation (electromyography), and heart
rhythm (electrocardiography).

**posturing**

Spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity (as seen
in CATATONIA). Abnormal posturing may also be a sign of certain injuries
to the brain or spinal cord, including the following:

**decerebrate posture** The arms and legs are out straight and rigid,
the toes point downward, and the head is arched backward.

**decorticate posture** The body is rigid, the arms are stiff and bent,
the fists are tight, and the legs are straight out.

**opisthotonus** The back is rigid and arching, and the head is thrown
backward.

An affected person may alternate between different postures as the
condition changes.

**pressured speech**

Speech that is increased in amount, accelerated, and difficult or
impossible to interrupt. Usually it is also loud and emphatic.
Frequently the person talks without any social stimulation and may
continue to talk even though no one is listening.

**prodrome**

An early or premonitory sign or symptom of a disorder.

**pseudocyesis**

A false belief of being pregnant that is associated with objective signs
and reported symptoms of pregnancy.

**psychological distress**

A range of symptoms and experiences of a person's internal life that are
commonly held to be troubling, confusing, or out of the ordinary.

**psychometric measures**

Standardized instruments such as scales, questionnaires, tests, and
assessments that are designed to measure human knowledge, abilities,
attitudes, or personality traits.

**psychomotor agitation**

Excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension.

The activity is usually nonproductive and repetitious and consists of
behaviors such as pacing, fidgeting, wringing of the hands, pulling of
clothes, and inability to sit still.

**psychomotor retardation**

Visible generalized slowing of movements and speech.

**psychotic features**

Features characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and formal thought
disorder.

**psychoticism**

Exhibiting a wide range of culturally incongruent odd, eccentric, or
unusual behaviors and cognitions, including both process (e.g.,
perception, dissociation)

Glossary of Technical Terms

and content (e.g., beliefs). Psychoticism is one of the five broad
PERSONALITY TRAIT DOMAINS defined in Section III "Alternative DSM-5
Model for Personality Disorders."

**purging disorder**

Eating disorder characterized by recurrent purging behavior to influence
weight or shape, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives,
diuretics, or other medications, in the absence of binge eating.

**racing thoughts**

A state in which the mind uncontrollably brings up random thoughts and
memories and switches between them very quickly. Sometimes the thoughts
are related, with one thought leading to another; other times they are
completely random.

A person experiencing an episode of racing thoughts has no control over
them and is unable to focus on a single topic or to sleep.

**rapid cycling**

Term referring to bipolar disorder characterized by the presence of at
least four mood episodes in the previous 12 months that meet the
criteria for a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode. Episodes
are demarcated either by partial or full remissions of at least 2 months
or by a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity (e.g., major
depressive episode to manic episode). The rapid cycling specifier can be
applied to bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.

**rapid eye movement (REM)**

A behavioral sign of the phase of sleep during which the sleeper is
likely to be experiencing dreamlike mental activity.

**repetitive speech**

Morphologically heterogeneous iterations of speech.

**residual phase**

Period after an episode of schizophrenia that has partly or completed
remitted but in which some symptoms may remain, and symptoms such as
listlessness, problems with concentrating, and withdrawal from social
activities may predominate.

**restless legs syndrome**

An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable
and unpleasant sensations in the legs (for pediatric restless legs
syndrome, the description of these symptoms should be in the child's own
words). The symptoms begin or worsen during periods of rest or
inactivity. Symptoms are partially or totally relieved by movement.
Symptoms are worse in the evening or at night than during the day or
occur only in the night/evening.

**restricted affectivity**

Little reaction to emotionally arousing situations; constricted
emotional experience and expression; indifference and aloofness in
normatively engaging situations. Restricted affectivity is a facet of
the broad personality trait domain DETACHMENT.

**rigid perfectionism**

Rigid insistence on everything being flawless, perfect, and without
errors or faults, including one's own and others' performance;
sacrificing of timeliness to ensure correctness in every detail;
believing that there is only one right way to do things; difficulty
changing ideas and/or viewpoint; preoccupation with details,
organization, and order. Lack of rigid perfectionism is a facet of the
broad personality trait domain DISINHIBITION.

**risk taking**

Engagement in dangerous, risky, and potentially self-damaging
activities, unnecessarily and without regard to consequences; lack of
concern for one's limitations and denial of the reality of personal
danger; reckless pursuit of goals regardless of the level of risk
involved. Risk taking is a facet of the broad personality trait domain
DISINHIBITION.

**rumination (rumination disorders)**

Repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at

least 1 month. Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit
out. In rumination disorders, there is no evidence that an associated
gastrointestinal or another medical condition (e.g., gastroesophageal
reflux) is sufficient to account for the repeated regurgitation.

Repeated episodes of rising from bed during sleep and walking about,
usually occurring during the first third of the major sleep episode.
While sleepwalking, the person has a blank, staring face, is relatively
unresponsive to the efforts of others to communicate with him or her,
and can be awakened only with great difficulty.

**somnolence (or "drowsiness")**

A state of near-sleep, a strong desire for sleep, or sleeping for
unusually long periods. It has two distinct meanings, referring both to
the usual state preceding falling asleep and to the chronic condition
that involves being in that state independent of a circadian rhythm.
Compare with HYPERSOMNIA.

personality trait domain NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p875}**830**

Glossary of Technical Terms

**subsyndromal**

Below a specified level or threshold required to qualify for a
particular condition. Subsyndromal conditions ( *formes frustes*) are

**Concepts of Distress**

Ataque de nervios

*Ataque de nervios* ("attack of nerves") is a syndrome among individuals
of Latino descent, characterized by symptoms of intense emotional upset,
including acute anxiety, anger, or grief; screaming and shouting
uncontrollably; attacks of crying; trembling; heat in the chest rising
into the head; and becoming verbally and physically aggressive.
Dissociative experiences (e.g., depersonalization, derealization,
amnesia), seizurelike or fainting episodes, and suicidal gestures are
prominent in some *ataques* but absent in others. A general feature of
an *ataque de nervios* is a sense of being out of control. Attacks
frequently occur as a direct result of a stressful event relating to the
family, such as news of the death of a close relative, conflicts with a
spouse or children, or witnessing an accident involving a family member.
For a minority of individuals, no particular social event triggers their
*ataques;* instead, their vulnerability to losing control comes from the
accumulated experience of suffering.

No one-to-one relationship has been found between *ataque* and any
specific psychiatric disorder, although several disorders, including
panic disorder, other specified or unspecified dissociative disorder,
and conversion disorder, have symptomatic overlap with *ataque*.

In community samples, *ataque* is associated with suicidal ideation,
disability, and outpatient psychiatric utilization, after adjustment for
psychiatric diagnoses, traumatic exposure, and other covariates.
However, some *ataques* represent normative expressions of acute
distress (e.g., at a funeral) without clinical sequelae. The term
*ataque de nervios* may also refer to an idiom of distress that includes
any "fit"-like paroxysm of emotionality (e.g., hysterical laughing) and
may be used to indicate an episode of loss of control in response to an
intense stressor.

**Related conditions in other cultural contexts:** Indisposition in
Haiti, blacking out in the Southern United States, and falling out in
the West Indies.

**Related conditions in DSM-5:** Panic attack, panic disorder, other
specified or unspecified dissociative disorder, conversion (functional
neurologic symptom) disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, other
specified or unspecified anxiety disorder, other specified or
unspecified trauma and stressor-related disorder.

Dhat syndrome

*Dhat syndrome* is a term that was coined in South Asia little more than
half a century ago to account for common clinical presentations of young
male patients who attributed their various symptoms to semen loss.
Despite the name, it is not a discrete syndrome but rather a cultural
explanation of distress for patients who refer to diverse symptoms, such
as anxiety, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, impotence, other multiple
somatic complaints, and depressive mood. The cardinal feature is anxiety
and distress about the loss of *dhat* in the absence of any identifiable
physiological dysfunction. *Dhat* was identified by patients as a white
discharge that was noted on defecation or urination. Ideas about this
substance are related to the concept of *dhatu* (semen) described in the
Hindu system of medicine, Ayurveda, as one of seven essential bodily
fluids whose balance is necessary to maintain health.

**833**

[]{#index_split_118.html#p879}**834**

Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress

Although *dhat syndrome* was formulated as a cultural guide to local
clinical practice, related ideas about the harmful effects of semen loss
have been shown to be widespread in the general population, suggesting a
cultural disposition for explaining health problems and symptoms with
reference to *dhat syndrome.* Research in health care settings has
yielded diverse estimates of the syndrome's prevalence (e.g., 64% of men
attending psychiatric clinics in India for sexual complaints; 30% of men
attending general medical clinics in Pakistan). Although *dhat syndrome*
is most commonly identified with young men from lower socioeconomic
backgrounds, middle-aged men may also be affected. Comparable concerns
about white vaginal discharge (leu-korrhea) have been associated with a
variant of the concept for women.

**Related conditions in other cultural contexts:** *koro* in Southeast
Asia, particularly Sin-gapore and *shen-k'uei* ("kidney deficiency") in
China.

**Related conditions in DSM-5:** Major depressive disorder, persistent
depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized anxiety disorder, somatic
symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, erectile disorder, early
(premature) ejaculation, other specified or unspecified sexual
dysfunction, academic problem.

Khyâl cap

"*Khyâl* attacks" ( *khyâl cap*), or "wind attacks," is a syndrome found
among Cambodians in the United States and Cambodia. Common symptoms
include those of panic attacks, such as dizziness, palpitations,
shortness of breath, and cold extremities, as well as other symptoms of
anxiety and autonomic arousal (e.g., tinnitus and neck soreness).
*Khyâl* attacks include catastrophic cognitions centered on the concern
that *khyâl* (a windlike substance) may rise in the body---along with
blood---and cause a range of serious effects (e.g., com-pressing the
lungs to cause shortness of breath and asphyxia; entering the cranium to
cause tinnitus, dizziness, blurry vision, and a fatal syncope). *Khyâl*
attacks may occur without warning, but are frequently brought about by
triggers such as worrisome thoughts, standing up (i.e., orthostasis),
specific odors with negative associations, and agoraphobic-type cues
like going to crowded spaces or riding in a car. *Khyâl* attacks usually
meet panic attack criteria and may shape the experience of other anxiety
and trauma-and stressor-related disorders. *Khyâl* attacks may be
associated with considerable disability.

**Related conditions in other cultural contexts:** Laos ( *pen lom*),
Tibet ( *srog rlung gi nad*), Sri Lanka ( *vata*), and Korea ( *hwa
byung*).

**Related conditions in DSM-5:** Panic attack, panic disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress
disorder, illness anxiety disorder.

Kufungisisa

*Kufungisisa* ("thinking too much" in Shona) is an idiom of distress and
a cultural explanation among the Shona of Zimbabwe. As an explanation,
it is considered to be causative of anxiety, depression, and somatic
problems (e.g., "my heart is painful because I think too much"). As an
idiom of psychosocial distress, it is indicative of interpersonal and
social difficulties (e.g., marital problems, having no money to take
care of children). *Kufungisisa* involves ruminating on upsetting
thoughts, particularly worries.

*Kufungisisa* is associated with a range of psychopathology, including
anxiety symptoms, excessive worry, panic attacks, depressive symptoms,
and irritability. In a study of a random community sample, two-thirds of
the cases identified by a general psychopathology measure were of this
complaint.

In many cultures, "thinking too much" is considered to be damaging to
the mind and body and to cause specific symptoms like headache and
dizziness. "Thinking too much"

may also be a key component of cultural syndromes such as "brain fag" in
Nigeria. In the case of brain fag, "thinking too much" is primarily
attributed to excessive study, which is considered to damage the brain
in particular, with symptoms including feelings of heat or crawling
sensations in the head.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p880}Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress
**835**

**Related conditions in other cultural contexts:** "Thinking too much"
is a common idiom of distress and cultural explanation across many
countries and ethnic groups. It has been described in Africa, the
Caribbean and Latin America, and among East Asian and Native American
groups.

**Related conditions in DSM-5:** Major depressive disorder, persistent
depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized anxiety disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, persistent
complex bereavement disorder (see "Conditions for Further Study").

Maladi moun

*Maladi moun* (literally "humanly caused illness," also referred to as
"sent sickness") is a cultural explanation in Haitian communities for
diverse medical and psychiatric disorders. In this explanatory model,
interpersonal envy and malice cause people to harm their enemies by
sending illnesses such as psychosis, depression, social or academic
failure, and inability to perform activities of daily living. The
etiological model assumes that illness may be caused by others' envy and
hatred, provoked by the victim's economic success as evidenced by a new
job or expensive purchase. One person's gain is assumed to produce
another person's loss, so visible success makes one vulnerable to
attack. Assigning the label of sent sickness depends on mode of onset
and social status more than presenting symptoms. The acute onset of new
symptoms or an abrupt behavioral change raises suspicions of a spiritual
attack. Someone who is attractive, intelligent, or wealthy is perceived
as especially vulnerable, and even young healthy children are at risk.

**Related conditions in other cultural contexts:** Concerns about
illness (typically, physical illness) caused by envy or social conflict
are common across cultures and often expressed in the form of "evil eye"
(e.g. in Spanish, *mal de ojo,* in Italian, *mal'occhiu*).

**Related conditions in DSM-5:** Delusional disorder, persecutory type;
schizophrenia with paranoid features.

Nervios

*Nervios* ("nerves") is a common idiom of distress among Latinos in the
United States and Latin America. *Nervios* refers to a general state of
vulnerability to stressful life experiences and to difficult life
circumstances. The term *nervios* includes a wide range of symptoms of
emotional distress, somatic disturbance, and inability to function. The
most common symptoms attributed to *nervios* include headaches and
"brain aches" (occipital neck tension), irritability, stomach
disturbances, sleep difficulties, nervousness, easy tearfulness,
inability to concentrate, trembling, tingling sensations, and *mareos*
(dizziness with occasional vertigo-like exacerbations). *Nervios* is a
broad idiom of distress that spans the range of severity from cases with
no mental disorder to presentations resembling adjustment, anxiety,
depressive, dissociative, somatic symptom, or psychotic disorders.
"Being nervous since childhood" appears to be more of a trait and may
precede social anxiety disorder, while "being ill with nerves" is more
related than other forms of *nervios* to psychiatric problems,
especially dissociation and depression.

**Related conditions in other cultural contexts:** *Nevra* among Greeks
in North America, *nierbi* among Sicilians in North America, and
*nerves* among whites in Appalachia and Newfoundland.

**Related conditions in DSM-5:** Major depressive disorder, peristent
depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized anxiety disorder, social
anxiety disorder, other specified or unspecified dissociative disorder,
somatic symptom disorder, schizophrenia.

Shenjing shuairuo

*Shenjing shuairuo* ("weakness of the nervous system" in Mandarin
Chinese) is a cultural syndrome that integrates conceptual categories of
traditional Chinese medicine with the

[]{#index_split_118.html#p881}**836**

Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress

Western diagnosis of neurasthenia. In the second, revised edition of the
*Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders* (CCMD-2-R), *shenjing
shuairuo* is defined as a syndrome composed of three out of five
nonhierarchical symptom clusters: weakness (e.g., mental fatigue),
emotions (e.g., feeling vexed), excitement (e.g., increased
recollections), nervous pain (e.g., headache), and sleep (e.g.,
insomnia). *Fan nao* (feeling vexed) is a form of irritability mixed
with worry and distress over conflicting thoughts and unfulfilled
desires. The third edition of the CCMD retains *shenjing shuairuo* as a
somatoform diagnosis of exclusion. Salient precipitants of *shenjing
shuairuo* include work-or family-related stressors, loss of face (
*mianzi, lianzi*), and an acute sense of failure (e.g., in academic
performance). *Shenjing shuairuo* is related to traditional concepts of
weakness ( *xu*) and health imbalances related to deficiencies of a
vital essence (e.g., the depletion of *qi* \[vital energy\] following
overstrain-ing or stagnation of *qi* due to excessive worry). In the
traditional interpretation, *shenjing* *shuairuo* results when bodily
channels ( *jing*) conveying vital forces ( *shen*) become dysregulated
as a result of various social and interpersonal stressors, such as the
inability to change a chronically frustrating and distressing situation.
Various psychiatric disorders are associated with *shenjing shuairuo,*
notably mood, anxiety, and somatic symptom disorders. In medical clinics
in China, however, up to 45% of patients with *shenjing shuairuo* do not
meet criteria for any DSM-IV disorder.

**Related conditions in other cultural contexts:** Neurasthenia-spectrum
idioms and syndromes are present in India ( *ashaktapanna*) and Japan (
*shinkei-suijaku*), among other settings. Other conditions, such as
brain fag syndrome, burnout syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome, are
also closely related.

**Related conditions in DSM-5:** Major depressive disorder, persistent
depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized anxiety disorder, somatic
symptom disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia,
posttraumatic stress disorder.

Susto

*Susto* ("fright") is a cultural explanation for distress and misfortune
prevalent among some Latinos in the United States and among people in
Mexico, Central America, and South America. It is not recognized as an
illness category among Latinos from the Caribbean. *Susto* is an illness
attributed to a frightening event that causes the soul to leave the body
and results in unhappiness and sickness, as well as difficulties
functioning in key social roles. Symptoms may appear any time from days
to years after the fright is experienced. In extreme cases, *susto* may
result in death. There are no specific defining symptoms for *susto*;
however, symptoms that are often reported by people with *susto* include
appetite disturbances, inadequate or excessive sleep, troubled sleep or
dreams, feelings of sadness, low self-worth or dirtiness, interpersonal
sensitivity, and lack of motivation to do anything. Somatic symptoms
accompanying *susto* may include muscle aches and pains, cold in the
extremities, pallor, headache, stomachache, and diarrhea. Precipitating
events are diverse, and include natural phenomena, animals,
interpersonal situations, and supernatural agents, among others.

Three syndromic types of *susto* (referred to as *cibih* in the local
Zapotec language) have been identified, each having different
relationships with psychiatric diagnoses. An interpersonal *susto*
characterized by feelings of loss, abandonment, and not being loved by
family, with accompanying symptoms of sadness, poor self-image, and
suicidal ideation, seemed to be closely related to major depressive
disorder. When *susto* resulted from a traumatic event that played a
major role in shaping symptoms and in emotional processing of the
experience, the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder appeared more
appropriate. *Susto* characterized by various recurrent somatic
symptoms---for which the person sought health care from several
practitioners---was thought to resemble a somatic symptom disorder.

**Related conditions in other cultural contexts:** Similar etiological
concepts and symptom configurations are found globally. In the Andean
region, *susto* is referred to as *espanto*.

[]{#index_split_118.html#p882}Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress
**837**

**Related conditions in DSM-5:** Major depressive disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder, other specified or unspecified trauma and
stressor-related disorder, somatic symptom disorders.

Taijin kyofusho

*Taijin kyofusho* ("interpersonal fear disorder" in Japanese) is a
cultural syndrome characterized by anxiety about and avoidance of
interpersonal situations due to the thought, feeling, or conviction that
one's appearance and actions in social interactions are inadequate or
offensive to others. In the United States, the variant involves having
an offensive body odor and is termed *olfactory reference syndrome.*
Individuals with *taijin kyofusho* tend to focus on the impact of their
symptoms and behaviors on others. Variants include major concerns about
facial blushing (erythrophobia), having an offensive body odor
(olfactory reference syndrome), inappropriate gaze (too much or too
little eye contact), stiff or awkward facial expression or bodily
movements (e.g., stiffening, trembling), or body deformity.

*Taijin kyofusho* is a broader construct than social anxiety disorder in
DSM-5. In addition to performance anxiety, *taijin kyofusho* includes
two culture-related forms: a "sensitive type,"

with extreme social sensitivity and anxiety about interpersonal
interactions, and an "offensive type," in which the major concern is
offending others. As a category, *taijin kyofusho* thus includes
syndromes with features of body dysmorphic disorder as well as
delusional disorder. Concerns may have a delusional quality, responding
poorly to simple reassurance or counterexample.

The distinctive symptoms of *taijin kyofusho* occur in specific cultural
contexts and, to some extent, with more severe social anxiety across
cultures. Similar syndromes are found in Korea and other societies that
place a strong emphasis on the self-conscious maintenance of appropriate
social behavior in hierarchical interpersonal relationships. *Taijin
kyofusho*--like symptoms have also been described in other cultural
contexts, including the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.

**Related conditions in other cultural contexts:** *Taein kong po* in
Korea.

**Related conditions in DSM-5:** Social anxiety disorder, body
dysmorphic disorder, delusional disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
olfactory reference syndrome (a type of other specified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder). Olfactory reference syndrome
is related specifically to the *jikoshu-kyofu* variant of *taijin
kyofusho,* whose core symptom is the concern that the person emits an
offensive body odor. This presentation is seen in various cultures
outside Japan.
