# CHAPTER 12

## Elimination Disorders

**307.6 (F98.0)** Enuresis
**307.7 (F98.1)** Encopresis
Other Specified Elimination Disorder
Unspecified Elimination Disorder

## This chapter describes conditions in which the predominant

disturbance is related to bowel or bladder problems. Elimination disorders are usu-
ally first diagnosed in childhood and include enuresis and encopresis (Table 12–1).
Placed in the chapter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or
Adolescence” in DSM-III and DSM-IV, elimination disorders are now contained in a
stand-alone chapter, which reflects a change in categorization recommended by the
Childhood and Adolescent Disorders Work Group.

Elimination disorders are common, with approximately 1% of children age 5 years
having encopresis and 5%–10% of 5-year-olds having nocturnal enuresis. These dis-
orders can continue into adolescence, with approximately 1% of adolescents experi-
encing nocturnal enuresis.
At least among older children, these disorders can be very embarrassing and have
a negative impact on self-esteem. Impairment is often a reflection of how the disor-
ders contribute to social ostracism and social withdrawal by the individuals, and to
anger and rejection by caregivers.

**234** DSM-5 Guidebook

Most elimination disorders have a functional cause and are not a neurological or
medical condition. Children with these disorders are usually first evaluated by pedi-
atricians and not mental health clinicians. This may reflect not only the obvious phys-
ical nature of the symptoms but also the ongoing controversy regarding when and to
what extent these disorders are manifestations of underlying emotional problems.

Enuresis

Enuresis is characterized by repeated urination into clothing or the bed. The behavior
is most often involuntary but it is sometimes intentional. Enuresis commonly occurs
during nighttime sleep (nocturnal subtype) but it may also occur while the person is
awake (diurnal subtype). Clinical judgment is necessary to assess the frequency of the be-
havior, the age beyond which it is appropriate, and the degree of distress or impairment
associated with enuresis. The DSM-5 criteria reflect no substantive proposed changes
to the DSM-IV criteria for enuresis.

Diagnostic Criteria for Enuresis **307.6 (F98.0)**

A. Repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes, whether involuntary or intentional.
B. The behavior is clinically significant as manifested by either a frequency of at least
twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months or the presence of clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of
functioning.
C. Chronological age is at least 5 years (or equivalent developmental level).
D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
diuretic, an antipsychotic medication) or another medical condition (e.g., diabetes,
spina bifida, a seizure disorder).

Specify whether:
**Nocturnal only:** Passage of urine only during nighttime sleep.
**Diurnal only:** Passage of urine during waking hours.
**Nocturnal and diurnal:** A combination of the two subtypes above.

Criterion A

This criterion clarifies that enuresis can be either involuntary or intentional. (DSM-III
required involuntary voiding.) The inclusion of intentional voiding allows the diag-
nosis to be made in children who are too embarrassed to ask to use the bathroom.

Criterion B

Given that short-term episodes of bed-wetting are common, the criterion requires a
frequency and duration of at least twice weekly for at least 3 consecutive months, or
the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment, in order to make the di-


**_Elimination Disorders_** **235**

agnosis. In contrast, the World Health Organization defines enuresis as wetting twice
per month (under age 7 years) or once per month (age 7 years and older) in the past
3 months.

Criterion C

The minimal age criterion has been set at 5 years, but medical guidelines vary on
when a child is old enough to stay dry. The majority of children are toilet trained for
daytime by age 5 years, and nighttime toilet training usually happens several months
later than daytime toilet training. Therefore, although it has been common practice to
define enuresis as abnormal from age 5 years, many only consider treatment for chil-
dren when they are at least 7 years old.

Criterion D

Medical conditions must be excluded as a cause of the bed-wetting. These include
neurological disorders (e.g., seizures, spina bifida), other medical conditions (e.g., uri-
nary tract infections, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, sleep apnea), and structural causes
(e.g., urinary tract obstruction, congenital defect of the posterior valve of the urethra).
As with any clinical problem, the clinician must exercise judgment and rule out alter-
native explanations for the condition.

Subtypes

_Nocturnal only_ is the most common subtype, and bed-wetting typically occurs during
the first one-third of the evening. The _diurnal only_ subtype is more common in girls.
Debate has focused on whether these subtypes are clinically useful or whether ex-
panded subtyping would be more appropriate. For example, “urge incontinence” and
“voiding postponement” are proposed subtypes of daytime enuresis that have been
associated with distinct behavioral problems and psychiatric comorbidity. The Interna-
tional Children’s Continence Society has suggested four subtypes of nocturnal enure-
sis based on whether the enuresis is primary (no dry period for longer than 6 months)
or secondary (relapse after at least a 6-month dry spell) and whether it is monosymp-
tomatic (no daytime bladder dysfunction) or nonmonosymptomatic (bladder symp-
toms such as urgency or voiding postponement can occur during the day).

Encopresis

_Encopresis_ refers to the repeated involuntary or occasionally intentional passage of fe-
ces into inappropriate places after the mental age of 4 years without any underlying
organic cause. Encopresis is most often caused by underlying functional constipation,
impaction, and retention with subsequent overflow. Encopresis can occur without
constipation, an event(s) often referred to as “nonretentive fecal soiling,” although this
type is less common. Encopresis is more common in boys. Children with soiling prob-
lems tend to have more psychological and behavioral problems than those without
(Joinson et al. 2006). No changes have been made in the criteria for DSM-5.


**236** DSM-5 Guidebook

Diagnostic Criteria for Encopresis **307.7 (F98.1)**

A. Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., clothing, floor), whether
involuntary or intentional.
B. At least one such event occurs each month for at least 3 months.
C. Chronological age is at least 4 years (or equivalent developmental level).
D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., lax-
atives) or another medical condition except through a mechanism involving consti-
pation.

Specify whether:
**With constipation and overflow incontinence:** There is evidence of constipation
on physical examination or by history.
**Without constipation and overflow incontinence:** There is no evidence of con-
stipation on physical examination or by history.

Criteria A and B

A diagnosis of encopresis requires defecating into inappropriate places at least once a
month for at least 3 months. This requirement is in keeping with the Rome Diagnostic Cri-
teria, a classification system created by pediatric gastroenterologists who set criteria for
functional gastrointestinal disorders in childhood (Drossman and Dumitrascu 2006).
These criteria have provided clinicians with a method for standardizing their definition
of clinical disorders and have allowed researchers from various fields to study the patho-
physiology and treatment of the same disorders from different points of view. The pas-
sage of feces may be either involuntary or intentional. When involuntary, the passage of
feces is often related to constipation, impaction, and retention with subsequent overflow.

Criterion C

Toilet training is usually completed by age 3 years, and the age requirement of 4 years
allows for some variability in normal toilet training. (In the case of children with devel-
opmental delays, the mental age must be at least 4 years.)

Criterion D

Medical explanations for the disturbance must be excluded before the diagnosis of
encopresis is made. Possible medical causes include use of laxatives, anorectal mal-
formations such as anal stenosis, spinal disorders (e.g., meningomyelocele, spinal
tumor), Hirschsprung’s disease, cerebral palsy, endocrine disorders (e.g., hypothy-
roidism, lead intoxication), and neuromuscular disorders.

Subtypes

Encopresis “with constipation and overflow incontinence” may result in feces that are
poorly formed and leakage occurring mostly during the day. The incontinence usu-


**_Elimination Disorders_** **237**

ally resolves after treatment of the constipation. Encopresis “without constipation
and overflow incontinence” usually results in feces of normal form and consistency
and is more likely to be associated with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct dis-
order. Although studies of children based on subtyping have found no significant dif-
ferences in behaviors or in social competence, subtyping of encopresis has treatment
implications. Disimpaction and laxatives may be needed if constipation is present,
whereas laxatives may worsen encopresis without constipation. Although DSM-5
does not define _constipation,_ the Rome Diagnostic Criteria require two of the follow-
ing symptoms: two or fewer defecations in the toilet per week; at least one episode of
fecal incontinence per week; history of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool
retention; history of painful or hard bowel movements; presence of a large fecal mass
in the rectum; and history of large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet.

Other Specified Elimination Disorder and

Unspecified Elimination Disorder

_Other specified elimination disorder_ refers to symptoms of an elimination disorder that
cause significant distress or impairment in functioning but fail to meet full diagnostic
criteria for any elimination disorder (e.g., passage of feces in inappropriate places for
only 2 months). The clinician can use this disorder category and communicate the rea-
son the symptoms or behavior did not meet full criteria for an elimination disorder. The
clinician is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., “low-frequency enuresis”).
_Unspecified elimination disorder_ should be used when an individual presents with
symptoms that are characteristic of an elimination disorder, with distress and func-
tional impairment, but that do not meet full diagnostic criteria and the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason the full criteria were not met, or there was insuffi-
cient information to do so.

Other Specified Elimination Disorder

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an elimi-
nation disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified elimination disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician choos-
es to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria
for any specific elimination disorder. This is done by recording “other specified elimina-
tion disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “low-frequency enuresis”).

**Coding note:** Code **788.39 (N39.498)** for other specified elimination disorder with uri-
nary symptoms; **787.60 (R15.9)** for other specified elimination disorder with fecal
symptoms.


**238** DSM-5 Guidebook

Unspecified Elimination Disorder

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an elimi-
nation disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The un-
specified elimination disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician choos-
es not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific elimination disorder,
and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

**Coding note:** Code **788.30 (R32)** for unspecified elimination disorder with urinary
symptoms; **787.60 (R15.9)** for unspecified elimination disorder with fecal symptoms.

KEY POINTS

- Now a separate diagnostic class, elimination disorders have been moved from
    the chapter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Ado-
    lescence.”
- DSM-5 recognizes that enuresis may be intentional or involuntary.
