## Trauma- and stressor-related disorders is a new diagnostic

class that brings together conditions previously listed in DSM-IV as anxiety disorders
(acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]); disorders that are usu-
ally first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence (reactive attachment disor-
der, the new disinhibited social engagement disorder); and adjustment disorders. All
disorders in this class, listed in Table 8–1, result from exposure to traumatic or stress-
ful situations or events explicitly recognized in the diagnostic criteria. In DSM-5, the
trauma- and stressor-related disorders are placed directly following the obsessive-
compulsive and related disorders and precede the dissociative disorders. The close
placement of these disorders is a reflection of the manual’s metastructure, whereby
the proximity of disorders denotes presumed etiological relationships. Many of the
symptoms of these disorders resemble those observed in individuals with obsessive-
compulsive disorder (i.e., uncontrolled thoughts and preoccupations), whereas disso-
ciative symptoms may occur in individuals with acute stress disorder, PTSD, or ad-
justment disorders.
The DSM-5 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum, Posttraumatic, and Disso-
ciative Disorders Work Group recommended creating a separate diagnostic class for
trauma- and stressor-related disorders because of research showing variations in the
clinical expression of psychological distress following exposure to traumatic or stress-
ful events (Andrews et al. 2009). Rather than a fear- or anxiety-based response, which

had been the justification for placing acute stress disorder and PTSD with the anxiety
disorders, the most prominent clinical features are anhedonic and dysphoric symp-
toms, anger and aggressive symptoms, or dissociative symptoms, thus calling for a
new and separate diagnostic class. Furthermore, it was thought logical to combine
these with the adjustment disorders, which also result from exposure to stressful events
and have a variable presentation. The childhood-onset reactive attachment disorder
and disinhibited social engagement disorder both result from social neglect, defined
as the absence of appropriate caregiving during childhood, and therefore fit well within
this new diagnostic class.
Important changes have been made to the DSM-5 criteria for the disorders. With
acute stress disorder, the traumatic event is now more explicitly specified as having
been experienced directly, witnessed, or experienced indirectly. DSM-IV’s Criterion
A2, regarding the person’s subjective reaction, has been eliminated. Based on evi-
dence that acute posttraumatic reactions vary considerably, and evidence that DSM-
IV’s emphasis on dissociative symptoms was overly restricting, the menu of symp-
toms has been expanded to 14 qualifying as intrusion, negative mood, dissociative,
avoidance, and/or arousal symptoms.
PTSD is no longer considered narrowly as a fear- and anxiety-based disorder, but
has been reconceptualized to include a wide spectrum of negative responses to trau-
matic experiences, including anhedonia-like and externalizing symptoms. The elimi-
nation of the requirement for a subjective negative response _at the time of_ the event is
one of the changes that led to removing PTSD from the anxiety disorders and placing
it in a class with other disorders that arise in response to traumatic or stressful events
that precede the emergence of symptoms. DSM-IV’s Criterion A2, which related to
the person’s subjective reaction to the event, has been deleted, as it was for acute
stress disorder. In addition, rather than three symptom clusters (reexperiencing,
avoidance/numbing, and arousal), there are now four clusters, because the avoid-
ance/numbing cluster has been split into two (described more fully in the section
“Posttraumatic Stress Disorder” later in this chapter). A “with dissociative symptoms”
subtype is new, having been added to acknowledge the fact that these symptoms are
frequent and constitute the presentation of a definable group of individuals with
PTSD. Also, a criteria set for PTSD in children 6 years and younger has been devel-
oped for use in preschool children, with a lowered diagnostic threshold. For that rea-
son, PTSD is now developmentally sensitive.


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **171**

In DSM-IV, reactive attachment disorder was a childhood diagnosis characterized
by aberrant social behaviors that resulted from what was described as “pathogenic
care” involving disregard for the child’s emotional and physical needs, in addition to
changes of primary caregiver that prevented the development of stable attachments.
There were two subtypes: _inhibited,_ in which the child showed little responsiveness to
others and no discriminated attachments, and _disinhibited,_ in which the child showed
no reticence with unfamiliar adults and a pattern of social boundary violations. In
DSM-5, these two subtypes are now distinct disorders: reactive attachment disorder
and disinhibited social engagement disorder.
These two disorders essentially result from social neglect and/or other situations
that limit a child’s opportunity to form selective attachments. Despite their etiological
similarities, they differ in important respects. Reactive attachment disorder resembles
internalizing disorders and overlaps modestly with depression, whereas disinhibited
social engagement disorder resembles externalizing disorders, particularly attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, with which it partially overlaps. Furthermore, the dis-
orders have distinctive relationships with attachment behaviors. Reactive attachment
disorder involves the lack of, or incompletely formed preferred attachments to, care-
giving adults. On the other hand, disinhibited social engagement disorder occurs in
children who lack attachments, children who have established attachments, and even
children with secure attachments. The two disorders also differ in their clinical corre-
lates, course, and response to intervention. For these reasons, the work group recom-
mended two separate diagnoses in DSM-5.
Last, the adjustment disorders are relatively unchanged from DSM-IV, apart from
their new placement in this chapter (Strain and Friedman 2011).

Reactive Attachment Disorder

Reactive attachment disorder has been refashioned from the broad DSM-IV conceptual-
ization and, as noted in the introduction above, is characterized by absent or underde-
veloped attachment between the child and caregivers. Because it is caused by grossly
inadequate parenting, the disorder may be associated with signs of severe neglect (e.g.,
malnutrition, poor hygiene) and may co-occur with developmental delays in language
acquisition and cognitive ability. The children show little responsiveness to others and
make scant effort to obtain comfort, support, nurturance, or protection from caregivers.
In addition, these children have episodes of negative emotions (e.g., irritability, sadness,
fearfulness) that are not easily explained. The diagnosis is not appropriate for children
developmentally unable to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must
have the cognitive capacity of at least a 9-month-old to receive the diagnosis.

Diagnostic Criteria for Reactive
Attachment Disorder **313.89 (F94.1)**

A. A consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward adult
caregivers, manifested by both of the following:


**172** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. The child rarely or minimally seeks comfort when distressed.
2. The child rarely or minimally responds to comfort when distressed.

B. A persistent social and emotional disturbance characterized by at least two of the
following:

1. Minimal social and emotional responsiveness to others.
2. Limited positive affect.
3. Episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness, or fearfulness that are evident
    even during nonthreatening interactions with adult caregivers.

C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced
by at least one of the following:

1. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emo-
    tional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met by caregiving adults.
2. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportunities to form stable
attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).
3. Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective at-
tachments (e.g., institutions with high child-to-caregiver ratios).

D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in
Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the lack of ade-
quate care in Criterion C).
E. The criteria are not met for autism spectrum disorder.
F. The disturbance is evident before age 5 years.
G. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months.

Specify if:
**Persistent:** The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.

Specify current severity:
Reactive attachment disorder is specified as **severe** when a child exhibits all symp-
toms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively high levels.

Criterion A

This criterion defines disturbed and inappropriate attachment behaviors observed in
the child toward adult caregivers. The child rarely or minimally seeks nurturance
from an attachment figure and rarely or minimally responds to comfort when dis-
tressed. Although some have suggested that social impairment or social communica-
tion is a core of this disorder, it is likely that the absence of a selective attachment
necessarily impairs social functioning, and that social behaviors improve markedly
once the child is in a more favorable environment, making attachment the core of the
disorder.

Criterion B

This criterion indicates that the diagnosis requires a persistent social and emotional
disturbance characterized by at least two of three behaviors: minimal social and emo-
tional responsiveness to others, limited positive affect, and episodes of unexplained


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **173**

irritability, sadness, or fearfulness even during nonthreatening interactions with care-
givers. Separating these behaviors from Criterion A restricts the diagnosis to those
children who have both of these features, which are highlighted in the DSM-5 criteria,
and the absence of an attachment figure, implied but not spelled out in DSM-IV (Cri-
terion A).

Criterion C

This criterion requires that “a pattern of extremes of insufficient care” be present, as
evidenced by at least one of three caregiver behaviors: disregard for a child’s needs
for comfort, stimulation, and affection; repeated changes of primary caregivers; and
rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective attach-
ments, such as institutions with a high child:caregiver ratio. From a practical point of
view, this criterion poses challenges for the clinician, because insufficient care is not
always disclosed and cannot always be clearly identified. Many young children can-
not describe their own experiences, and caregivers may be implicated in inadequate
care (and therefore have no reason to self-report). Yet, retaining Criterion C precludes
making the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder in children whose maltreat-
ment is unknown to the clinician. On the other hand, there are no case reports of
young children exhibiting reactive attachment disorder without at least a reasonable
inference of seriously inadequate caregiving. The revisions are intended to describe
in more detail what is known about the types of care that appear to predispose chil-
dren to reactive attachment disorder. The criteria remain less specific than desirable,
but this is a challenging area of investigation and data are limited.

Criterion D

This criterion is unchanged from DSM-IV. It is presumed that the pattern of extremes
of insufficient care described in Criterion C is responsible for the child’s aberrant be-
havior.

Criterion E

Because of symptom overlap, autism spectrum disorder needs to be ruled out. Aber-
rant social behaviors manifest in young children with reactive attachment disorder,
but they are also features of autism spectrum disorder. The two disorders can be dis-
tinguished on the basis of developmental histories of neglect, the presence of re-
stricted interests or ritualized behaviors, specific deficits in social communication,
and the presence of selective attachment behaviors. Although the work group ac-
knowledged that autism spectrum disorder and reactive attachment disorder could
be comorbid, the lack of data combined with the concern about mistaking the former
for the latter led them to recommend that the criterion be included.

Criteria F and G

The symptoms must be evident before age 5 years (Criterion F), as in DSM-IV. New
to DSM-5, however, is the requirement that the child has reached a developmental age


**174** DSM-5 Guidebook

of 9 months (Criterion G). This criterion has been added to ensure that an attachment
disorder is not diagnosed in children who are developmentally incapable of demon-
strating a focused attachment. Stranger wariness and separation protest, in addition
to selective comfort seeking or behavioral indicators of selective attachment, typically
emerge between ages 7 and 9 months.

Specifiers

The specifiers may be used to indicate chronicity (present for more than 12 months)
and current severity.

Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder

Disinhibited social engagement disorder is new in DSM-5, having been split off from
the DSM-IV reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood. The essential
feature of disinhibited social engagement disorder is a pattern of behavior that in-
volves inappropriate and overly familiar behavior with unfamiliar adults or relative
strangers, thus violating the social boundaries of the culture. The child must have the
cognitive capacity of at least a 9-month-old. The disorder is uncommon, even among
those who were severely neglected and subsequently placed in foster care or raised
in group facilities. Disinhibited social engagement disorder has been described from
the second year of life through adolescence. At very young ages, children are usually
reticent when interacting with strangers. Children with this disorder not only lack
such reticence but willingly engage with strangers and will even go off with unfamil-
iar adults. In preschool children, verbal and social intrusiveness are common, often
accompanied by attention-seeking behaviors. When the disorder persists into middle
childhood, verbal and physical overfamiliarity manifest, as well as inauthentic ex-
pression of emotions, and by adolescence indiscriminate behavior extends to peers.
Peer relationships tend to be superficial and characterized by conflict.
Like reactive attachment disorder, disinhibited social engagement disorder is as-
sociated with cognitive and language delays, stereotypies, and other signs of severe
neglect, including malnutrition and poor hygiene. Signs of the disorder may persist
even when the neglect is no longer present. Thus, disinhibited social engagement dis-
order may be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attachments or
whose attachment to their caregivers ranges from disturbed to secure.

Diagnostic Criteria for Disinhibited Social
Engagement Disorder **313.89 (F94.2)**

A. A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and interacts with unfa-
miliar adults and exhibits at least two of the following:

1. Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar
    adults.
2. Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (that is not consistent with culturally
sanctioned and with age-appropriate social boundaries).


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **175**

3. Diminished or absent checking back with adult caregiver after venturing away,
    even in unfamiliar settings.
4. Willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with minimal or no hesitation.

B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder) but include socially disinhibited behavior.
C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced
by at least one of the following:

1. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emo-
    tional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met by caregiving adults.
2. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportunities to form stable
attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).
3. Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective at-
tachments (e.g., institutions with high child-to-caregiver ratios).

D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in
Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the pathogenic
care in Criterion C).
E. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months.

Specify if:
**Persistent:** The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.

Specify current severity:
Disinhibited social engagement disorder is specified as **severe** when the child ex-
hibits all symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively
high levels.

Criterion A

This criterion focuses the disorder more on aberrant social behavior than on disordered
attachment behavior. The diagnosis requires that two or more of four examples of disin-
hibited behavior be present. These include reduced (or absent) reticence in approaching
and interacting with unfamiliar adults, overly familiar verbal or physical behavior, di-
minished or absent checking back with the caregiver, and willingness to go off with an
unfamiliar adult. These behaviors are aberrant in many cultures, where a child would
typically become upset in these situations. The items composing the criterion are empir-
ically derived from investigations of the construct.

Criterion B

This criterion is presumed necessary from several lines of evidence suggesting co-oc-
currence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) signs and the social im-
pulsivity that characterizes the indiscriminately social/disinhibited phenotype. For
that reason, it is important that the behavior not be explained as a result of the impul-
sivity typically seen in children with ADHD. It appears that one may have ADHD
with socially indiscriminate behavior and that one may have socially indiscriminate
behavior without ADHD, but there are often moderately strong correlations between
the two symptom profiles. Thus, rather than make ADHD a rule-out for disinhibited


**176** DSM-5 Guidebook

social engagement disorder, it seems more useful to direct attention to the distinct-
ness of the latter from ADHD.

Criterion C

Extremes of insufficient care must be present as evidenced by at least one of three
caregiver patterns: disregard for a child’s need for comfort, stimulation, and affection;
repeated changes of caregivers; and rearing in unusual settings that severely limit op-
portunities to form selective attachments, such as institutions with a high child:care-
giver ratio. Insufficient care is retained in Criterion C (as in DSM-IV for the disinhib-
ited type of reactive attachment disorder) for the important reason that children with
adequate caregiving but chromosome 7 deletion demonstrate behavior phenotypi-
cally similar to that of individuals with disinhibited social engagement disorder. In-
sufficient care is described exactly as in reactive attachment disorder because no evi-
dence suggests that certain types of pathogenic care are more or less likely to lead to
reactive attachment disorder or to disinhibited social engagement disorder.

Criterion D

This criterion is retained from DSM-IV for the same reason that it was retained in re-
active attachment disorder, described in the previous section: the presumption is that
the pathogenic care situation described in Criterion C is responsible for the child’s
disturbed behavior.

Criterion E

The requirement that the child has reached a developmental age of 9 months serves
the same purpose as Criterion G for reactive attachment disorder, as noted earlier.

Specifiers

The specifiers may be used to indicate chronicity (present for more than 12 months)
and current severity.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

PTSD was introduced in DSM-III, but in the past this syndrome was recognized as “shell
shock” or “war neurosis” because it was most commonly seen in wartime situations.
Many of its symptoms, such as intrusive thoughts and autonomic hyperarousal, were
also seen in victims of other traumatic events, including natural disasters. In DSM-I, the
disorder was recognized as “gross stress reaction,” considered one of several transient
situational personality disorders:

```
Under conditions of great or unusual stress, a normal personality may utilize established
patterns of reaction to deal with overwhelming fear. The patterns of such reactions differ
from those of neurosis or psychosis chiefly with respect to clinical history, reversibility
of reaction, and its transient character. When promptly and adequately treated, the con-
dition may clear rapidly. It is also possible that the condition may progress to one of the
```

**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **177**

```
neurotic reactions.... This diagnosis is justified only in situations in which the individual
has been exposed to severe physical demands or extreme emotional stress, such as in
combat or in civilian catastrophe (fire, earthquake, explosion, etc.). (p. 40)
```
PTSD is common in the general population and can occur at any age, even in young
children. In women the most frequent precipitating event is a physical assault, whereas
in men the event often involves a combat experience. PTSD generally begins soon af-
ter the event is experienced, but onset can be delayed. For many individuals, PTSD is
chronic, but symptoms can fluctuate and may worsen during stressful times.
The major etiological factor leading to PTSD is a traumatic event that involves ex-
posure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. The event is
typically outside the range of normal human experience. Business losses, marital con-
flicts, and the death of a loved one are _not_ stressors that cause PTSD. A person’s age,
history of psychiatric illness, level of social support, and proximity to the stressor are
all factors that affect the likelihood of developing PTSD.
The DSM-5 criteria depart from those in DSM-IV in several important respects
(Friedman et al. 2011). The stressor (Criterion A) is more explicitly described, and the sub-
jective reaction (Criterion A2 in DSM-IV) has been eliminated. Whereas DSM-IV had
three major symptom clusters corresponding to Criteria B, C, and D (reexperiencing,
avoidance/numbing, and arousal, respectively), DSM-5 has four because the avoid-
ance/numbing cluster has been split into two distinct clusters: persistent avoidance
and negative alterations in cognitions and mood. The latter includes new or reconcep-
tualized symptoms such as persistent and exaggerated negative expectations about
oneself, others, and the world itself; persistent distorted cognitions about the cause or
consequences of the event; and persistent negative emotional state. The final cluster,
arousal, now includes reckless or self-destructive behavior (Criterion E2), but is oth-
erwise unchanged. Diagnostic thresholds have been lowered for children, and a specific
preschool subtype is included.
The work group dropped DSM-IV Criterion A2, which required individuals to
have subjectively experienced fear, helplessness, or horror at the time of a traumatic
event. In the past, it was believed that PTSD required an intense emotional reaction
at the time of an adverse event, but not all people respond to traumatic events in the
same way. Clinical and research experience show that Criterion A2 was not useful in
predicting who would later exhibit symptoms of PTSD. Furthermore, the criterion
tended to exclude people for whom exposure to a traumatic event was an occupational
hazard for which they had been extensively trained, and who were just “doing their
job,” and therefore did not experience a horrific reaction at the time.
The work group has also added a new symptom cluster. The avoidance and numb-
ing symptoms have been separated, with numbing symptoms renamed as a fourth
cluster called “negative alterations in cognitions and mood” (Criterion D). The cluster
is defined as showing evidence of two or more of seven specified symptoms in per-
sons over age 6. The criteria reflect the anhedonic component of PTSD in which persons
with PTSD are unable to experience positive emotions of joy or love, or enjoyment of
pleasure, which can be devastating to marriages and relationships.
The subtype for children 6 years and younger was created to lower symptom thresh-
olds and eliminate some symptoms that are difficult to assess in preschool children.


**178** DSM-5 Guidebook

Research had shown that the prevalence of PTSD in children when using the DSM-IV
criteria was lower than expected (Scheeringa et al. 2011).
The “with dissociative symptoms” subtype was created because it has long been
known that people exposed to traumatic events can experience dissociation (15%–
30% of persons with PTSD), mainly depersonalization and derealization (Lanius et al.
2012). These people respond differently to treatment, and neuroimaging studies show
that those who dissociate have distinctive patterns of altered neurocircuitry. The body
of information justified creating a specific subtype to recognize this specific subset of
individuals with PTSD.

Diagnostic Criteria for
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder **309.81 (F43.10)**

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Note:** The following criteria apply to adults, adolescents, and children older than 6
years. For children 6 years and younger, see corresponding criteria below.

A. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one
(or more) of the following ways:

1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).
2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others.
3. Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member or close
friend. In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the
event(s) must have been violent or accidental.
4. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic
event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains; police officers repeat-
edly exposed to details of child abuse).
**Note:** Criterion A4 does not apply to exposure through electronic media, televi-
sion, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related.

B. Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the
traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred:

1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic
    event(s).
    **Note:** In children older than 6 years, repetitive play may occur in which themes
    or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed.
2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream
are related to the traumatic event(s).
**Note:** In children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable con-
tent.
3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as
if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a contin-
uum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of
present surroundings.)
**Note:** In children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play.


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **179**

4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external
    cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).
5. Marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or re-
    semble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).

C. Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning
after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by one or both of the following:

1. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about
    or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).
2. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversa-
tions, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts,
or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).

D. Negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s),
beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two
(or more) of the following:

1. Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically
    due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as head injury, alco-
    hol, or drugs).
2. Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about oneself, oth-
ers, or the world (e.g., “I am bad,” “No one can be trusted,” “The world is com-
pletely dangerous,” “My whole nervous system is permanently ruined”).
3. Persistent, distorted cognitions about the cause or consequences of the trau-
matic event(s) that lead the individual to blame himself/herself or others.
4. Persistent negative emotional state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame).
5. Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities.
6. Feelings of detachment or estrangement from others.
7. Persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g., inability to experience
happiness, satisfaction, or loving feelings).

E. Marked alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event(s),
beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two
(or more) of the following:

1. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation) typically ex-
    pressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects.
2. Reckless or self-destructive behavior.
3. Hypervigilance.
4. Exaggerated startle response.
5. Problems with concentration.
6. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep).

F. Duration of the disturbance (Criteria B, C, D, and E) is more than 1 month.
G. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
H. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
medication, alcohol) or another medical condition.

Specify whether:
**With dissociative symptoms:** The individual’s symptoms meet the criteria for
posttraumatic stress disorder, and in addition, in response to the stressor, the indi-
vidual experiences persistent or recurrent symptoms of either of the following:


**180** DSM-5 Guidebook

1. **Depersonalization:** Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached
    from, and as if one were an outside observer of, one’s mental processes or
    body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality
    of self or body or of time moving slowly).
2. **Derealization:** Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings
    (e.g., the world around the individual is experienced as unreal, dreamlike, dis-
    tant, or distorted).
**Note:** To use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must not be attributable to
the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts, behavior during alcohol in-
toxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).

Specify if:
**With delayed expression:** If the full diagnostic criteria are not met until at least 6
months after the event (although the onset and expression of some symptoms may
be immediate).

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder for Children 6 Years and Younger**
A. In children 6 years and younger, exposure to actual or threatened death, serious
injury, or sexual violence in one (or more) of the following ways:

1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).
2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others, especially primary
caregivers.
**Note:** Witnessing does not include events that are witnessed only in electronic
media, television, movies, or pictures.
3. Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a parent or caregiving figure.

B. Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the
traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred:

1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic
    event(s).
    **Note:** Spontaneous and intrusive memories may not necessarily appear dis-
    tressing and may be expressed as play reenactment.
2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream
are related to the traumatic event(s).
**Note:** It may not be possible to ascertain that the frightening content is related
to the traumatic event.
3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the child feels or acts as if the
traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a continuum,
with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of pres-
ent surroundings.) Such trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play.
4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external
cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).
5. Marked physiological reactions to reminders of the traumatic event(s).

C. One (or more) of the following symptoms, representing either persistent avoidance
of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s) or negative alterations in cogni-
tions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s), must be present, beginning
after the event(s) or worsening after the event(s):


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **181**

```
Persistent Avoidance of Stimuli
```
1. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid activities, places, or physical reminders that
    arouse recollections of the traumatic event(s).
2. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid people, conversations, or interpersonal situa-
tions that arouse recollections of the traumatic event(s).
**Negative Alterations in Cognitions**
3. Substantially increased frequency of negative emotional states (e.g., fear, guilt,
sadness, shame, confusion).
4. Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities, including
constriction of play.
5. Socially withdrawn behavior.
6. Persistent reduction in expression of positive emotions.

D. Alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event(s), begin-
ning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or
more) of the following:

1. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation) typically ex-
    pressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects (including
    extreme temper tantrums).
2. Hypervigilance.
3. Exaggerated startle response.
4. Problems with concentration.
5. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep).

E. The duration of the disturbance is more than 1 month.
F. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in relationships
with parents, siblings, peers, or other caregivers or with school behavior.
G. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
medication or alcohol) or another medical condition.
Specify whether:
**With dissociative symptoms:** The individual’s symptoms meet the criteria for
posttraumatic stress disorder, and the individual experiences persistent or recur-
rent symptoms of either of the following:

1. **Depersonalization:** Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached
    from, and as if one were an outside observer of, one’s mental processes or
    body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality
    of self or body or of time moving slowly).
2. **Derealization:** Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings
    (e.g., the world around the individual is experienced as unreal, dreamlike, dis-
    tant, or distorted).
**Note:** To use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must not be attributable to
the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts) or another medical condi-
tion (e.g., complex partial seizures).
Specify if:
**With delayed expression:** If the full diagnostic criteria are not met until at least
6 months after the event (although the onset and expression of some symptoms
may be immediate).


**182** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion A

This criterion has been edited to remove ambiguities and tighten the definition of a
traumatic event. The criteria make clear that exposure involves actual or threatened
death, serious injury, or sexual violence (the latter replaced the phrase “threat to the
physical integrity of self or others”). The ways in which a person may be exposed are
more explicit than in DSM-IV as well, and include directly experiencing or witnessing
the event, or learning about an event that a close relative or friend experienced, al-
though in the latter cases the actual or threatened death must have been violent or
accidental. Learning that a relative has died from natural causes, for example, is not
qualifying exposure. Criterion A4 is new and requires that the experience be repeated
or that there be extreme exposure to aversive details for an event (such as that expe-
rienced by first responders). Although the DSM-IV language may well have included
such exposures, it became clear following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
that those involved in cleanup activities can develop symptoms (even though they
may not have witnessed the event). DSM-5 also makes clear, in a note, that media ex-
posure is an insufficient qualifier (e.g., reading about the event, or watching the event
on television).

Criteria B, C, D, and E

Instead of three major symptom clusters as in DSM-IV, there are now four: intrusion
symptoms (Criterion B), avoidance (Criterion C), negative alterations in cognitions
and mood associated with the event (Criterion D), and marked alteration in arousal
and reactivity (Criterion E). Reckless or self-destructive behavior (E2) has been added
as a possible alteration in arousal and reactivity.
The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. The individual may
have recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event (B1). The empha-
sis is on spontaneous or triggered recurrent memories of the event that usually in-
clude sensory, emotional, or physiological behavioral components. A common
reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams during which the event is replayed or
represented by related dangers (B2). Distressing dreams may contain themes that are
representative of or thematically related to the major threats involved in the traumatic
event (e.g., in the case of a motor vehicle accident survivor, the dreams may involve
crashing cars). There may be dissociative states during which components of the
event are relived and the person behaves as though reexperiencing the event. Disso-
ciative reactions (“flashbacks”) are typically brief but may cause great distress (B3).
The individual persistently avoids stimuli associated with the trauma (Criterion
C). An individual may refuse to discuss his or her traumatic experience, or may en-
gage in avoidance strategies to minimize awareness of emotional reactions, such as
avoiding watching news coverage of traumatic experiences, refusing to return to the
place where the trauma occurred, or avoiding interacting with others who shared the
same experience (C2).
The individual may have negative alteration in cognitions and mood associated
with the traumatic event—for example, being unable to recall important aspects of
the event (dissociative amnesia) (D1), or exaggerated negative beliefs about oneself


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **183**

(e.g., I’m a bad person.”) (D2). Some may experience a sustained negative emotional
state, including fear, horror, or anger (D4), or develop feelings of detachment or es-
trangement from others (D6), such as _depersonalization,_ a detached sense of oneself, or
_derealization,_ having a distorted view of one’s surroundings. Others may report an in-
ability to feel positive emotions such as happiness or joy (D7), symptoms sometimes
referred to as emotional or psychic numbing.
The person must have two or more symptoms of arousal, such as an exaggerated
startle response or problems with concentration. Some individuals experience irrita-
ble behavior and angry outbursts (E1). In response to research findings, this symptom
description has been expanded in DSM-5 to indicate that the behavior may occur with
little (or no) provocation and may involve verbal or physical aggression toward others
or objects. This helps to distinguish PTSD from other causes of aggression, such as an-
tisocial personality disorder.

Criterion F

The duration is more than 1 month. This is unchanged from DSM-IV (Criterion E) and
helps separate PTSD from acute stress disorder.

Criterion G

This criterion is unchanged from DSM-IV and requires that symptoms cause signifi-
cant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.

Criterion H

The “rule-out” criterion is new to DSM-5 and brings PTSD into conformity with other
disorders whereby substances of abuse, medications, and other medical conditions
are eliminated as the cause of the disturbance. An important condition to rule out is
a postconcussive syndrome, or traumatic brain injury, that is responsible for a variety
of symptoms that could be due to PTSD, such as difficulty concentrating, irritability
or anger, or sensitivity to light or noises. It is possible for an individual to have both
conditions.

Acute Stress Disorder

Acute stress disorder was introduced in DSM-IV to recognize that dissociative symp-
toms could occur immediately following a traumatic event and that this would pre-
dict the development of PTSD. In DSM-5, the symptoms have been collapsed into a
list of 14 possible symptoms (Criterion B), of which at least 9 must be present to indi-
cate a diagnosis, none mandatory. Dissociative symptoms are included, but they are
not required as they were in DSM-IV. Research has shown that acute stress reactions
are variable and that many people with intense and disabling reactions never experi-
ence dissociation (Bryant et al. 2011).
The clinical presentation of this disorder typically involves an anxiety response
with some form of reexperiencing or reactivity to the traumatic event. In some per-


**184** DSM-5 Guidebook

sons, a dissociative or detached presentation can predominate, although these indi-
viduals typically will also display strong emotional or physiological reactivity in
response to trauma reminders. In others, there can be a strong anger response in which
reactivity is characterized by irritable or even aggressive responses.

Diagnostic Criteria for Acute Stress Disorder **308.3 (F43.0)**

A. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation in one
(or more) of the following ways:

1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).
2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others.
3. Learning that the event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend.
**Note:** In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the
event(s) must have been violent or accidental.
4. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic
event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains, police officers repeat-
edly exposed to details of child abuse).
**Note:** This does not apply to exposure through electronic media, television,
movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related.

B. Presence of nine (or more) of the following symptoms from any of the five catego-
ries of intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal, beginning
or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred:
**Intrusion Symptoms**

1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic
    event(s). **Note:** In children, repetitive play may occur in which themes or as-
    pects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed.
2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream
are related to the event(s). **Note:** In children, there may be frightening dreams
without recognizable content.
3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as
if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a contin-
uum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of
present surroundings.) **Note:** In children, trauma-specific reenactment may oc-
cur in play.
4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress or marked physiological reactions
in response to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect
of the traumatic event(s).
**Negative Mood**
5. Persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g., inability to experience
happiness, satisfaction, or loving feelings).
**Dissociative Symptoms**
6. An altered sense of the reality of one’s surroundings or oneself (e.g., seeing
oneself from another’s perspective, being in a daze, time slowing).
7. Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **185**

```
due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as head injury, alco-
hol, or drugs).
Avoidance Symptoms
```
8. Efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely as-
    sociated with the traumatic event(s).
9. Efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations, activities,
    objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings
    about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).
**Arousal Symptoms**
10. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep, restless sleep).
11. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation), typically ex-
pressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects.
12. Hypervigilance.
13. Problems with concentration.
14. Exaggerated startle response.

C. Duration of the disturbance (symptoms in Criterion B) is 3 days to 1 month after trau-
ma exposure.
**Note:** Symptoms typically begin immediately after the trauma, but persistence for
at least 3 days and up to a month is needed to meet disorder criteria.

D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
medication or alcohol) or another medical condition (e.g., mild traumatic brain in-
jury) and is not better explained by brief psychotic disorder.

Criterion A

This criterion describes the range of exposure that may lead to the development of
symptoms and is identical to Criterion A for PTSD, described above. DSM-IV Crite-
rion A2 was deleted because it required that the person’s response involve “intense
fear, helplessness, or horror” and the criterion was thought by the work group to have
little clinical utility.

Criterion B

Nine or more of 14 items are required for the diagnosis, and they roughly correspond
to those described above that occur in PTSD (Criteria B, C, D, and E).

Criterion C

Instead of a minimum duration of 2 days as in DSM-IV (Criterion G), this item requires
that the full symptom picture be present for at least 3 days following a traumatic event
but no longer than 1 month following the event. The purpose of this criterion is to sep-
arate acute stress disorder from PTSD, which lasts more than 1 month.


**186** DSM-5 Guidebook

Criterion D

The symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment. The extreme level of
anxiety may interfere with sleep, energy levels, and capacity to attend to tasks. Avoid-
ance in acute stress disorder can result in generalized withdrawal from many situa-
tions perceived as potentially threatening, which can result in nonattendance at
medical appointments, avoidance of driving, and absenteeism from work.

Criterion E

The symptoms must not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or an-
other medical condition. When brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event,
symptoms of acute stress disorder may appear. It is important to recognize that what-
ever caused the head trauma may also constitute a psychologically traumatic event
and that postconcussive and acute stress disorder symptoms are not mutually exclu-
sive and may co-occur.

Adjustment Disorders

Adjustment disorders are conditions in which people develop symptoms of emo-
tional distress or behavioral symptoms in response to stressful events, or feel over-
whelmed by their circumstances, but the symptoms fail to meet criteria for a more
specific diagnosis such as acute stress disorder or PTSD. With adjustment disorders,
people can experience varied symptoms, ranging from depression, to anxiety, to im-
paired work ability. These “walking wounded” may have symptoms sufficiently se-
vere to require treatment or care.
Adjustment disorders were accorded a separate class beginning in DSM-III. Ear-
lier DSMs recognized that individuals could develop symptoms in response to “a dif-
ficult situation or to newly experienced environmental factors” (DSM-I, p. 41) in the
absence of serious personality difficulties, yet adjustment disorders were included in
the category “transient situational personality disorders.” Because adjustment disor-
ders develop in response to identifiable stressors, the work group thought it appro-
priate to place them in the diagnostic class trauma- and stressor-related disorders in
DSM-5.
It is important to understand that if the individual’s symptoms lead to a more spe-
cific disorder, such as major depressive disorder or panic disorder, that diagnosis
trumps adjustment disorder, even when a stressor appears central to the onset of the
disorder.

Diagnostic Criteria for Adjustment Disorders

A. The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifi-
able stressor(s) occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s).
B. These symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced by one or
both of the following:


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **187**

1. Marked distress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stress-
    or, taking into account the external context and the cultural factors that might
    influence symptom severity and presentation.
2. Significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

C. The stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another mental disor-
der and is not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting mental disorder.
D. The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement.
E. Once the stressor or its consequences have terminated, the symptoms do not per-
sist for more than an additional 6 months.

Specify whether:
**309.0 (F43.21) With depressed mood:** Low mood, tearfulness, or feelings of
hopelessness are predominant.
**309.24 (F43.22) With anxiety:** Nervousness, worry, jitteriness, or separation anx-
iety is predominant.
**309.28 (F43.23) With mixed anxiety and depressed mood:** A combination of de-
pression and anxiety is predominant.
**309.3 (F43.24) With disturbance of conduct:** Disturbance of conduct is predom-
inant.
**309.4 (F43.25) With mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct:** Both emo-
tional symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and a disturbance of conduct are pre-
dominant.
**309.9 (F43.20) Unspecified:** For maladaptive reactions that are not classifiable as
one of the specific subtypes of adjustment disorder.

Criterion A

There must be an identifiable stressor, and symptoms must begin within 3 months of
its onset. Symptoms can be emotional or behavioral (e.g., depression, anxiety, acting
out). The operative question in suspected cases of adjustment disorder is, “What is
the individual having trouble adjusting to?”

Criterion B

This criterion is important because it describes the significant impairment in func-
tioning or subjective distress that distinguishes adjustment disorder from normal re-
sponses that many persons experience in the face of a stressful situation or event.
Adjustment disorders now require distress and/or impairment, rather than either
distress or impairment as in DSM-IV.

Criteria C and D

The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting condition, such as ma-
jor depressive disorder, and a more specific mental disorder has been ruled out. For
example, if a person experiencing anxiety in response to a stressor has symptoms that
otherwise meet criteria for panic disorder, that disorder—and not adjustment disor-
der—is the appropriate diagnosis.


**188** DSM-5 Guidebook

The symptoms cannot represent normal bereavement, which is not considered a
mental disorder. That said, should a bereaved individual develop symptoms consis-
tent with major depressive episode, the correct diagnosis is major depressive disorder
because the so-called bereavement exclusion has been removed (see Chapter 5, “Mood
Disorders,” for a discussion of the bereavement exclusion).

Criterion E

Adjustment disorders are time-limited reactions that occur in response to stressors
and that resolve when the stressor or its consequences end; the symptoms do not per-
sist for more than an additional 6 months. If symptoms persist, the person most likely
has some other condition, such as generalized anxiety disorder.

Subtypes

Once an adjustment disorder is diagnosed, the clinician can specify a subtype, which
will differ depending on the person’s presenting symptoms. Adjustment disorders
are varied but in most cases involve either depressive or anxiety-related symptoms,
or a mixture of depression and anxiety. In some cases, the stressor may lead an indi-
vidual to act out or misbehave, justifying the subtype “with disturbance of conduct.”
For example, an adolescent may shoplift or steal, or an adult may engage in an extra-
marital affair or embezzle funds. Sometimes a person may experience a mixture of
emotions and behavior problems, leading to the subtype “with mixed disturbance of
emotions and conduct.”

Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related

Disorder and Unspecified Trauma- and

Stressor-Related Disorder

These are residual categories to use for individuals with symptoms of a trauma- or
stressor-related disorder who have distress or impairment but whose symptoms do
not meet criteria for a more specific disorder in the class. The category other specified
trauma- and stressor-related disorder is used when the clinician chooses to commu-
nicate the reason that the presentation does not meet the full criteria. The clinician is
encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., _ataque de nervios_ ).
The category unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder is used when the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met, or there is insuffi-
cient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Trauma- and
Stressor-Related Disorder **309.89 (F43.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a trauma-
and stressor-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not


**_Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders_** **189**

meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related disorders
diagnostic class. The other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that
the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific trauma- and stressor-related
disorder. This is done by recording “other specified trauma- and stressor-related disor-
der” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “persistent complex bereavement disorder”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Adjustment-like disorders with delayed onset of symptoms that occur more**
    **than 3 months after the stressor.**
2. **Adjustment-like disorders with prolonged duration of more than 6 months**
    **without prolonged duration of stressor.**
3. **Ataque de nervios:** See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appen-
    dix to DSM-5.
4. **Other cultural syndromes:** See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the
    Appendix to DSM-5.
5. **Persistent complex bereavement disorder:** This disorder is characterized by se-
    vere and persistent grief and mourning reactions (see Chapter 22, “Conditions for
    Further Study,” this volume).

Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related
Disorder **309.9 (F43.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a trauma-
and stressor-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not
meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related disor-
ders diagnostic class. The unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder category
is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the
criteria are not met for a specific trauma- and stressor-related disorder, and includes
presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diag-
nosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

KEY POINTS

- This new chapter brings together conditions in which an identifiable traumatic
    event or stressor or insufficient parenting has induced the disorder.
- DSM-IV reactive attachment disorder has been split to create a reformulated re-
    active attachment disorder and the new disinhibited social engagement disorder.
    This change was made to recognize that some children exposed to a pattern of
    extremes of insufficient care develop emotionally withdrawn behavior, whereas
    others become indiscriminately social.


**190** DSM-5 Guidebook

- The stressor criterion (A) for acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress dis-
    order (PTSD) has been revised to be more explicit in describing the types of
    events that lead to these disorders. Also, PTSD is now defined by the develop-
    ment of symptoms in each of four clusters, rather than three clusters. The avoid-
    ance/numbing cluster has been split into an avoidance cluster and a negative
    alterations in cognitions and mood cluster. A developmentally sensitive criteria
    set for PTSD has been included for children 6 years and younger.
- Adjustment disorders are mostly unchanged but specifically exclude those ex-
    periencing normal bereavement.
