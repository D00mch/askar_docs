## The chapter on feeding and eating disorders has combined the feed-

ing disorders (pica, rumination disorder) from the DSM-IV chapter “Disorders Usu-
ally First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” with the eating disorders
(anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) to better reflect their shared phenomenology and
pathophysiology. The diagnosis avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces
and extends the DSM-IV diagnosis feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. In
addition, binge-eating disorder, previously included in DSM-IV’s Appendix B, has
now achieved full disorder status. Feeding and eating disorders reflect dysfunctional
appetitive drive and behavior and can span the entire age range. Table 11–1 lists the dis-
orders included in this chapter.
Disordered eating and eating-related behaviors have been recognized for centu-
ries. Richard Morton (1636–1698) is credited with making the first clinical description
of anorexia nervosa in 1689, but it was Sir William Gull (1816–1890) who coined the
term in the late nineteenth century. Gull’s patients were mostly emaciated young
women with amenorrhea, constipation, and an abnormally slow pulse who were none-
theless remarkably overactive. His account of the disorder remains noteworthy for its
attention to detail.
Despite Gull’s and other descriptions, eating and feeding disorders were not listed
in DSM until DSM-III, when they were included in the chapter “Disorders Usually First

Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.” Eating disorders were given their
own chapter in DSM-IV because it was clear that they could occur across the age
range. In revisiting the issue, the DSM-5 Eating Disorders Work Group recommended
that feeding disorders also be included in the same chapter with eating disorders be-
cause they, too, can occur across the age range.

Pica

The essential feature of pica is the eating of nonnutritive nonfood substances on a per-
sistent basis for a period of at least 1 month. Medical accounts that resemble the modern-
day definition of pica date back many centuries. Historically, pica has been consid-
ered either as an accompaniment to conditions such as pregnancy or developmental
disabilities or as a symptom of medical disorders such as iron deficiency. Children up
to age 24 months frequently mouth or even eat nonnutritive items, but this behavior
does not suggest that the child has pica. Although frequently associated with children
with developmental delays, pica is not confined to children or to individuals with in-
tellectual developmental disorders.
Pica has been regarded as an independent disorder since its inclusion in DSM-III.
The criteria were revised for DSM-5 to ensure that they can be used with individuals
of any age.

Diagnostic Criteria for Pica

A. Persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances over a period of at least 1
month.
B. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is inappropriate to the develop-
mental level of the individual.
C. The eating behavior is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice.
D. If the eating behavior occurs in the context of another mental disorder (e.g., intel-
lectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder], autism spectrum disorder,
schizophrenia) or medical condition (including pregnancy), it is sufficiently severe
to warrant additional clinical attention.


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **219**

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for pica is **307.52** and is used for children or adults.
The ICD-10-CM codes for pica are **(F98.3)** in children and **(F50.8)** in adults.

Specify if:
**In remission:** After full criteria for pica were previously met, the criteria have not
been met for a sustained period of time.

Criterion A

A single ingestion of a nonnutritive, nonfood substance is not sufficient to merit the
diagnosis of pica. The eating must be persistent over a 1-month period. Changes to
DSM-5 include the addition of the term _nonfood_ ; the wording “nonnutritive substances”
was potentially problematic because, with nonfood not specified, the term could in-
clude foodstuffs with no nutritional value, such as diet soda.

Criterion B

Mouthing of objects, including nonnutritive, nonfood substances, is developmentally
normal in young infants. A minimum age of 2 years is recommended because pica is
not an appropriate diagnosis for young children.

Criterion C

People around the world eat clay or dirt (called _geophagy_ ) for a variety of reasons.
Commonly, geophagy is a traditional cultural activity that takes place during preg-
nancy, for religious ceremonies, or as a remedy for disease, particularly in Central
Africa and the Southern United States. The indigenous Pomo of Northern California
also include dirt in their diet. Although it is a cultural practice, it may also fill a phys-
iological need (or perceived need) for nutrients.

Criterion D

Pica frequently occurs in individuals with developmental delays and sometimes in
pregnant women. Individuals with schizophrenia may have delusional beliefs about
the need to ingest nonfood substances. If the eating behavior is severe enough to war-
rant independent clinical attention, then the additional diagnosis of pica is appropri-
ate. DSM-5 has changed the wording from “during the course of” to “in the context
of” to retain consistency with parallel criteria for rumination disorder and avoidant/
restrictive food intake disorder, and because the example given (intellectual develop-
mental disorder) does not run a course.

Rumination Disorder

Rumination disorder is characterized by the repeated regurgitation of food. Included
in some form in the medical literature from the seventeenth century onward, rumina-
tion disorder occurs across the age range and in both genders. Individuals with this


**220** DSM-5 Guidebook

disorder repeatedly regurgitate swallowed or partially digested food, which may
then be rechewed and either reswallowed or expelled. Adolescents and adults may
be less likely to rechew regurgitated material. There is no involuntary retching, nau-
sea, heartburn, odors, or abdominal pains associated with the regurgitation, as there
is with typical vomiting. Although the disorder occurs more commonly in infants,
young children, and individuals with developmental disabilities, it also occurs in oth-
erwise healthy adolescents and adults. Unlike in typical vomiting, the regurgitation
is typically described as effortless and unforced.
DSM-III included rumination disorder of infancy as an independent disorder. The
criteria have been modified for DSM-5 to ensure that they are appropriate for individ-
uals of any age.

Diagnostic Criteria for Rumination Disorder **307.53 (F98.21)**

A. Repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least 1 month. Regurgitated food
may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out.
B. The repeated regurgitation is not attributable to an associated gastrointestinal or
other medical condition (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux, pyloric stenosis).
C. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder. 
D. If the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder (e.g., intellectual
disability [intellectual developmental disorder] or another neurodevelopmental dis-
order), they are sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention.

Specify if:
**In remission:** After full criteria for rumination disorder were previously met, the cri-
teria have not been met for a sustained period of time.

Criterion A

This criterion requires repeated regurgitation of food for at least 1 month. Not all in-
dividuals with rumination disorder, particularly older individuals and those with
normal intelligence, rechew the regurgitated food. Therefore, DSM-5 has deleted the
rechewing requirement and instead states, “Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re-
swallowed, or spit out.” In addition, the DSM-IV requirement that the behavior fol-
low “a period of normal functioning” has been deleted because this may be difficult
to determine.

Criterion B

Individuals with rumination disorder may have a history of reflux, and it may be dif-
ficult clinically to reliably parse out the medical and psychological components of the
behavior. In recognition of this clinical difficulty, DSM-5 requires ruling out an asso-
ciated gastrointestinal or other medical condition.


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **221**

Criterion C

Rumination behavior is well documented to occur in persons with conventional eat-
ing disorders. This criterion requires that the rumination be more than a symptom of
one of the eating disorders. If it occurs apart from the eating disorder, then it can be
independently diagnosed.

Criterion D

Rumination disorder commonly occurs in the context of developmental delays, often
as a means of self-stimulation. In these cases, this behavior is more appropriately con-
sidered a symptom of these other disorders or conditions. If the rumination behavior
is severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention, then the additional diag-
nosis of rumination disorder is appropriate. DSM-5 has changed the wording from “dur-
ing the course of” to “in the context of” to maintain consistency with parallel criteria
for pica and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and because the example given
(intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]) does not, strictly speak-
ing, run a course.

Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces and extends feeding disorder of
infancy or early childhood from DSM-IV. This disorder is a disturbance of eating or
feeding behavior that takes the form of avoiding or restricting food intake. The change
in the formal name of the disorder reflects the fact that there are a number of types of
presentation that occur across the age range rather than being restricted to infancy
and early childhood. Three main subtypes have been identified in the existing litera-
ture: individuals who do not eat enough or show little interest in feeding or eating;
individuals who accept only a limited diet in relation to sensory features; and indi-
viduals whose food refusal is related to aversive experience.
Avoidance or restriction associated with insufficient intake or lack of interest in
food usually develops in infancy or early childhood, although it can begin in adoles-
cence; onset in adulthood is rare. This disorder does not include developmentally
normal food avoidance, which is characterized by picky eating in childhood or re-
duced food intake associated with advanced age. Pregnant women may restrict in-
take or avoid certain foods because of altered sensory sensitivities, but this is a self-
limited behavior and the diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is not
warranted unless the eating disturbance is extreme and full criteria are met.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder appears equally common in males and
females in infancy and childhood. Various functional consequences are associated
with this disorder: impairments in physical development, relationship and social dif-
ficulties, caregiver stress, and problems in family functioning.
This diagnosis has been renamed from feeding disorder of infancy or early child-
hood in DSM-IV, a diagnosis that was rarely used. In revamping this category, the au-
thors of DSM-5 expect that the new category will be more useful. The category should
potentially fill a clinical need because a substantial number of individuals—not exclu-


**222** DSM-5 Guidebook

sively children and adolescents—restrict their food intake and develop significant
physiological and/or psychosocial problems, but their presentations fail to meet cri-
teria for an eating disorder. Avoidance/restrictive food intake disorder is a broad cat-
egory intended to capture this range of presentations.

Diagnostic Criteria for Avoidant/Restrictive
Food Intake Disorder **307.59 (F50.8)**

A. An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eating or food;
avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food; concern about aversive
consequences of eating) as manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate
nutritional and/or energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following:

1. Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering
    growth in children).
2. Significant nutritional deficiency.
3. Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements.
4. Marked interference with psychosocial functioning.

B. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or by an associat-
ed culturally sanctioned practice.
C. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia
nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way
in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced.
D. The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical condition or not
better explained by another mental disorder. When the eating disturbance occurs
in the context of another condition or disorder, the severity of the eating distur-
bance exceeds that routinely associated with the condition or disorder and war-
rants additional clinical attention.

Specify if:
**In remission:** After full criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder were
previously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time.

Criterion A

Many young children with avoidant/restrictive food intake difficulties had symptoms
that failed to meet DSM-IV criteria for feeding disorder because of the primary focus in
those criteria on failure to gain weight or weight loss, as well as the fact that certain fea-
tures of presentation are also commonly seen in older individuals. “Feeding distur-
bance” has been replaced by “an eating or feeding disturbance” to account for the
wider age range of people who have this disorder. Consequences resulting from food
avoidance or restriction may persist, and this criterion has been expanded beyond
weight loss or inability to gain weight. Faltering growth, nutritional deficiency, or de-
pendency on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, and marked interference


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **223**

with psychosocial functioning have been added because these are common clinically
significant consequences of such eating or feeding disturbances.

Criterion B

Because extreme poverty and cultural practices, such as religious fasting, can also re-
sult in significant weight loss, this criterion includes the phrase “not better explained
by lack of available food” and the requirement that there be no evidence that a “cul-
turally sanctioned” practice alone, such as particular religious or cultural observa-
tions, might account for the disorder.

Criterion C

Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements resulting in weight loss is a core
feature of anorexia nervosa and may be a compensatory behavior in bulimia nervosa.
For older children or young adolescents, these disorders share a number of features,
such as low weight and food avoidance. Anorexia nervosa, however, is associated
with fear of gaining weight and perceptual disturbances regarding one’s body weight
or shape. In the case of bulimia nervosa, the restriction or fasting is a compensatory
behavior for the recurrent episodes of binge eating. It is necessary to make a distinc-
tion between restricted food intake in the context of eating disorders, in which there
are weight or shape concerns, and restricted food intake in which such concerns are
not present.

Criterion D

Gastrointestinal (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux), endocrinological (e.g., diabetes), and
neurological (e.g., those related to oral/esophageal/pharyngeal structural or func-
tional problems) conditions can cause feeding disturbances and need to be distin-
guished from avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.

Anorexia Nervosa

Anorexia nervosa is characterized by persistent energy intake restriction, an intense
fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body self-perception. Anorexia nervosa was
the first eating disorder described and appears to have been present at different
points in history and to be present throughout different cultures. The disorder is as-
sociated with distorted self-image and other cognitive distortions regarding food and
eating. Individuals with anorexia nervosa sometimes engage in repeated weighing,
measuring, and assessing of their body in the mirror. The key clinical feature is de-
fined as a refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal level for
age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Anorexia nervosa is associ-
ated with high rates of morbidity (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, growth retardation, os-
teoporosis) and mortality.
Anorexia nervosa typically has an onset in adolescence and is more prevalent
among females. The disorder can affect men and women of any age, race or ethnicity,


**224** DSM-5 Guidebook

and socioeconomic background. The disorder has an estimated prevalence of 0.3%–
1% in women and 0.1% in men.
Anorexia nervosa was listed in DSM-I as an example of psychophysiological gas-
trointestinal reaction and in DSM-II as a feeding disturbance within the special symp-
toms category. It finally achieved full disorder status in DSM-III. The core diagnostic
criteria for anorexia nervosa are conceptually unchanged from DSM-IV, with one ex-
ception: _the requirement for amenorrhea has been eliminated_ (DSM-IV’s Criterion D).
Some individuals with anorexia nervosa may exhibit all other symptoms and signs of
the disorder and report at least some menstrual activity. In addition, this criterion
could not be applied to premenarcheal girls, women taking oral contraceptives, post-
menopausal women, or males. Because some data indicate that women who endorse
amenorrhea have poorer bone health than do women who fail to meet this criterion,
the information is clinically important even if not required for the diagnosis. In addi-
tion, the clinical characteristics and course for women with presentations that meet
all the DSM-IV criteria for anorexia nervosa except amenorrhea closely resemble the
characteristics of women with presentations that meet all of the criteria.

Diagnostic Criteria for Anorexia Nervosa

A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly
low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical
health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally
normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.
B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that inter-
feres with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.
C. Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced, undue
influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recogni-
tion of the seriousness of the current low body weight.

**Coding note:** The ICD-9-CM code for anorexia nervosa is **307.1,** which is assigned
regardless of the subtype. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the subtype (see below).

Specify whether:
**(F50.01) Restricting type:** During the last 3 months, the individual has not engaged in re-
current episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the mis-
use of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). This subtype describes presentations in which
weight loss is accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise.
( **F50.02) Binge-eating/purging type:** During the last 3 months, the individual has
engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced
vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).
Specify if:
**In partial remission:** After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met,
Criterion A (low body weight) has not been met for a sustained period, but either
Criterion B (intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat or behavior that inter-
feres with weight gain) or Criterion C (disturbances in self-perception of weight and
shape) is still met.
**In full remission:** After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met, none
of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **225**

Specify current severity:
The minimum level of severity is based, for adults, on current body mass index (BMI)
(see below) or, for children and adolescents, on BMI percentile. The ranges below are
derived from World Health Organization categories for thinness in adults; for children
and adolescents, corresponding BMI percentiles should be used. The level of severity
may be increased to reflect clinical symptoms, the degree of functional disability, and
the need for supervision.
**Mild:** BMI ≥ 17 kg/m^2
**Moderate:** BMI 16–16.99 kg/m^2
**Severe:** BMI 15–15.99 kg/m^2
**Extreme:** BMI < 15 kg/m^2

Criterion A

The DSM-IV wording “Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally nor-
mal weight for age and height” has been changed to emphasize the importance of en-
ergy homeostasis for maintenance of a minimally normal weight. This change allows
for applicability of the diagnosis to individuals who employ increased activity as a
means of reducing weight.

Criterion B

DSM-IV required “fear of weight gain.” A significant minority of individuals with an-
orexia nervosa, however, explicitly deny experiencing such fear. Therefore, DSM-5
has added a clause to focus on behavior, “persistent behavior that interferes with
weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.”

Criterion C

The wording of this item has changed from “denial of the seriousness of the current
low body weight” in DSM-IV to “persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of
the current low body weight.” The word _denial_ was removed because of the lack of
empirical evidence supporting its use and the concern that it conveyed a paternalistic
and pejorative attitude.

Subtypes and Specifiers

In DSM-5, the subtypes restricting and binge-eating/purging are specified for the
last 3 months. Although data suggest that subtyping is useful clinically and for re-
search purposes, there is significant crossover between subtypes, and clinicians had
difficulty specifying the subtype for the “current episode” of illness (the DSM-IV
standard).
Clinicians can also specify whether the person’s disorder is in full remission or in
partial remission. The distinction is that with partial remission, in which low body
weight (Criterion A) is no longer an issue, the person still has an intense fear of gain-
ing weight or of being fat, or has a disturbed body image.


**226** DSM-5 Guidebook

Current severity can be indicated by specifying whether the disorder is mild, mod-
erate, severe, or extreme, based on body mass index.

Bulimia Nervosa

Bulimia nervosa is characterized by episodes of bingeing on food (i.e., consuming a
large amount of food in a short amount of time), followed by attempts to purge the
body of the food via vomiting, laxatives, or excessive exercise. The behavior is per-
formed in the context of overconcern with weight and shape. Russell (1979) observed
that both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are developmental disorders that
share the characteristics fear of fatness and body image distortion. As with anorexia
nervosa, there are medical consequences of bulimia nervosa, including loss of electro-
lytes, erosion of tooth enamel (due to repeated exposure to acidic gastric contents),
cavities, stomach ulcers, stomach or esophagus ruptures, constipation, irregular
heartbeat, and an increased tendency toward suicidal behavior. Bulimia nervosa also
exhibits marked differences from anorexia nervosa. Individuals with bulimia nervosa
tend to develop eating disorder symptoms later in life, generally lose less weight, and
have a tendency to be more extroverted and impulsive than persons with anorexia
nervosa.
This disorder, simply called “bulimia,” was included in DSM-III. The name was
changed to bulimia nervosa in DSM-III-R. Approximately 90% of people diagnosed with
bulimia nervosa are women, and its prevalence is estimated at 1.0%–1.5% in young
women.
The only change in the criteria is a reduction in the required minimum average
frequency of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behavior (Criterion C).
Clinicians can now rate severity levels that range from mild to extreme depending on
the number of episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week.
Although DSM-IV required that subtype (purging or nonpurging) be specified, a
literature review indicated that individuals with the nonpurging subtype closely re-
sembled individuals with binge-eating disorder. In addition, precisely how to define
nonpurging inappropriate behaviors (e.g., fasting or excessive exercise) was unclear.
For these reasons, DSM-5 has eliminated the purging and nonpurging subtypes for
bulimia nervosa. Instead, clinicians can specify whether the disorder is in partial or
full remission and the current severity (mild, moderate, severe, extreme).

Diagnostic Criteria for Bulimia Nervosa **307.51 (F50.2)**

A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by
both of the following:

1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount
    of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar
    period of time under similar circumstances.
2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one
    cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **227**

B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain,
such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications;
fasting; or excessive exercise.
C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on aver-
age, at least once a week for 3 months.
D. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.
E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.

Specify if:
**In partial remission:** After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met,
some, but not all, of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.
**In full remission:** After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met, none
of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.

Specify current severity:
The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of inappropriate compensa-
tory behaviors (see below). The level of severity may be increased to reflect other
symptoms and the degree of functional disability.
**Mild:** An average of 1–3 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per
week.
**Moderate:** An average of 4–7 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors
per week.
**Severe:** An average of 8–13 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors
per week.
**Extreme:** An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate compensatory be-
haviors per week.

Criterion A

Many people may experience an isolated episode of overeating, such as at a party
with unlimited free food. Bulimia nervosa is an appropriate diagnosis in cases in
which there are recurrent episodes of binge eating that occur during a discrete period
of time and involve the consumption of a large amount of food, and the person re-
ports feeling a lack of control.

Criterion B

The bulimia nervosa diagnosis requires that the binge eating be accompanied by re-
current inappropriate compensatory behaviors intended to counteract the effects of
the binge episode and prevent weight gain (e.g., vomiting, laxative abuse, diuretic
abuse, excessive exercise).

Criterion C

Although DSM-IV required that episodes of binge eating and inappropriate compen-
satory behaviors both occur, on average, twice per week over a 3-month period, re-
search found that the clinical characteristics of individuals reporting bingeing and
purging once per week were similar to those of individuals whose behavior met the


**228** DSM-5 Guidebook

DSM-IV twice-per-week criterion. DSM-5 therefore requires that the binge eating and
inappropriate compensatory behaviors occur at least once a week for 3 months.

Criterion D

Individuals with bulimia nervosa are preoccupied with body shape and weight. They
may report low self-esteem due to body image issues.

Criterion E

Individuals with anorexia nervosa may have a presentation that falls under the sub-
type referred to as _binge-eating/purging type,_ which must be differentiated from buli-
mia nervosa. The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa requires a refusal to maintain normal
body weight. When that requirement is met, the appropriate diagnosis is anorexia
nervosa.

Binge-Eating Disorder

Binge-eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating without
the recurrent use of compensatory behaviors. It was listed in Appendix B (“Criteria
Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study”) in DSM-IV, and the DSM-5 Eating Disor-
ders Work Group recommended that it achieve full disorder status. Binge-eating dis-
order is the most frequent eating disorder in the United States (1.6% of women, 0.8%
of men) and is more prevalent among those seeking weight loss treatment than in the
general population.
The distinction between binge-eating disorder and bulimia nervosa is sometimes
unclear, and the two categories may represent different stages of the same underlying
disorder. Compared with individuals with bulimia nervosa, people with binge-eating
disorder are generally older, are more likely to be male, and have a later age at onset
of the disorder.
Approximately two-thirds of individuals with binge-eating disorder have a history
of using inappropriate compensatory behaviors, suggesting a past diagnosis of bulimia
nervosa. Although weight and shape concerns are not required for the diagnosis, they
are commonly part of the presentation.
Clinicians can rate current severity based on number of binge-eating episodes per
week (although the level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms and
the degree of functional disability). Clinicians can also specify whether the disorder
is in partial or full remission.

Diagnostic Criteria for Binge-Eating Disorder **307.51 (F50.8)**

A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized
by both of the following:

1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount


**_Feeding and Eating Disorders_** **229**

```
of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat in a similar pe-
riod of time under similar circumstances.
```
2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one
    cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).

B. The binge-eating episodes are associated with three (or more) of the following:

1. Eating much more rapidly than normal.
2. Eating until feeling uncomfortably full.
3. Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry.
4. Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating.
5. Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward.

C. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present.
D. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.
E. The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compen-
satory behavior as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the
course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.
Specify if:
**In partial remission:** After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously
met, binge eating occurs at an average frequency of less than one episode per
week for a sustained period of time.
**In full remission:** After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously met,
none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.

Specify current severity:
The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of episodes of binge eating
(see below). The level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms and the
degree of functional disability.
**Mild:** 1–3 binge-eating episodes per week.
**Moderate:** 4–7 binge-eating episodes per week.
**Severe:** 8–13 binge-eating episodes per week.
**Extreme:** 14 or more binge-eating episodes per week.

Criterion A

The requirement of binge eating mirrors that for bulimia nervosa. The criterion re-
quires “recurrent episodes” to differentiate this disorder from context-specific in-
stances where an individual may binge on food, such as at a wedding or banquet.

Criterion B

Criterion B requires at least three of five indicators of impaired control: eating much
more rapidly than usual; eating until feeling uncomfortably full; eating large amounts
of food when not hungry; eating alone because of embarrassment; and feeling disgust,
depression, or guilt after the episode. The best overall indicators for correctly identify-
ing binge eating are “eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hun-
gry” and “eating alone because of feeling embarrassed.” Among men the most
common feature of binge eating is eating more rapidly than usual, whereas among


**230** DSM-5 Guidebook

women the most common feature is feeling disgusted, depressed, or very guilty after-
ward. Research indicates that the requirement for three or more symptoms yields the
most accurate prediction of binge eating while minimizing the false positives.

Criterion C

This criterion speaks to the specificity of distress associated with the binge eating.
Distress related to co-occurring disorders would not meet this criterion.

Criterion D

Analyses based on once-weekly and twice-weekly classifications were remarkably
similar. In DSM-IV Appendix B, it was suggested that the frequency of binge days, as
opposed to binge episodes, be assessed, and that a minimum average frequency of
twice per week over 6 months be required. Research indicates that criteria identical to
those for bulimia nervosa would not change caseness significantly. Therefore, Crite-
rion D was changed to be similar to Criterion C for bulimia nervosa, requiring at least
once a week for 3 months.

Criterion E

Binge-eating disorder is characterized by the absence of recurrent use of inappropri-
ate compensatory mechanisms after eating large amounts of food.

Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder

and Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder

Other specified and unspecified feeding or eating disorder should be considered as
diagnoses when the individual has symptoms of a feeding and eating disorder that
are distressing and cause impairment but do not meet the full criteria for a more spe-
cific disorder in the class.
The categories replace DSM-IV’s eating disorder not otherwise specified. The cat-
egory other specified feeding or eating disorder is used when the clinician chooses to
communicate the reason that the presentation does not meet full criteria. The clinician
is encouraged to record the specific reason (e.g., atypical anorexia nervosa).
The category unspecified feeding or eating disorder is used when the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met, or there is insufficient infor-
mation to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Feeding or
Eating Disorder **307.59 (F50.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a feeding
and eating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,

occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class.
The other specified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does
not meet the criteria for any specific feeding and eating disorder. This is done by re-
cording “other specified feeding or eating disorder” followed by the specific reason
(e.g., “bulimia nervosa of low frequency”).
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” desig-
nation include the following:

1. **Atypical anorexia nervosa:** All of the criteria for anorexia nervosa are met, except
    that despite significant weight loss, the individual’s weight is within or above the
    normal range.
2. **Bulimia nervosa (of low frequency and/or limited duration):** All of the criteria
    for bulimia nervosa are met, except that the binge eating and inappropriate com-
    pensatory behaviors occur, on average, less than once a week and/or for less than
    3 months.
3. **Binge-eating disorder (of low frequency and/or limited duration):** All of the cri-
    teria for binge-eating disorder are met, except that the binge eating occurs, on av-
    erage, less than once a week and/or for less than 3 months.
4. **Purging disorder:** Recurrent purging behavior to influence weight or shape (e.g.,
    self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications) in the
    absence of binge eating.
5. **Night eating syndrome:** Recurrent episodes of night eating, as manifested by
    eating after awakening from sleep or by excessive food consumption after the eve-
    ning meal. There is awareness and recall of the eating. The night eating is not bet-
    ter explained by external influences such as changes in the individual’s sleep-wake
    cycle or by local social norms. The night eating causes significant distress and/or
    impairment in functioning. The disordered pattern of eating is not better explained
    by binge-eating disorder or another mental disorder, including substance use, and
    is not attributable to another medical disorder or to an effect of medication.

Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder **307.50 (F50.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a feeding
and eating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class.
The unspecified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific
feeding and eating disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).


**232** DSM-5 Guidebook

KEY POINTS

- This chapter combines the feeding disorders, formerly placed in the DSM-IV
    chapter “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adoles-
    cence,” with the eating disorders. Both groups of disorders are characterized by
    disturbed consummatory behaviors.
- The criteria for pica and rumination disorder have been revised to ensure that the
    disorders can be diagnosed in persons of all ages. Similarly, avoidant/restrictive
    food intake disorder no longer has an age restriction.
- The requirement that anorexia nervosa be accompanied by amenorrhea has
    been dropped because research showed little difference between those with or
    without the symptom.
- With bulimia nervosa, the only change in the criteria is a reduction in the re-
    quired minimum average frequency of binge eating and inappropriate compen-
    satory behavior to one episode per week (Criterion C), because research did
    not support the requirement in DSM-IV for two episodes per week.
- Binge-eating disorder has been elevated to full disorder status in DSM-5.
