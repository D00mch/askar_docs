# CHAPTER 2

## Use of DSM-5 and Major

## Changes From DSM-IV

###### 9

## DSM-5 represents a significant departure from its predecessors,

as indicated by changes to specific categories and disorders as well as its overall or-
ganization (its metastructure). The manual was reorganized in response to recom-
mendations made by the Diagnostic Spectra and DSM/ICD Harmonization Study
Group, convened by the American Psychiatric Association to consider ways in which
disorders might be organized and whether advances in neuroscience, brain imaging,
and genetics might suggest a framework for arranging disorders by more than com-
mon symptoms. What emerged from those discussions is reflected by the reorganiza-
tion of the 19 major diagnostic classes in DSM-5 (Table 2–1).
The pattern of chapter placement in DSM-5 reflects scientific advances in the un-
derstanding of psychiatric disorders and of the presumed etiological and pathophys-
iological relationships among them (Andrews et al. 2009). These changes were made
to facilitate a more comprehensive diagnosis and treatment approach. Rather than or-
dering the diagnostic classes as presented in DSM-IV, developers of the new manual
arranged them in a developmental life span fashion. DSM-5 begins with neurodevel-
opmental disorders, often diagnosed in infancy and early childhood, and progresses
through diagnostic areas more commonly diagnosed in adulthood, such as sleep-wake
disorders.
Within each diagnostic class, specific disorders are arranged so that those typi-
cally diagnosed in childhood are listed first. This revised ordering also represents an
attempt to place close to one another those diagnostic areas that appear related. For
example, the specific class bipolar and related disorders has been created and placed
immediately after schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Another
example is the placement of dissociative disorders between the category trauma- and
stressor-related disorders and the somatic symptom and related disorders. Dissocia-
tive disorders are thought by many to be strongly influenced by traumatic events and
have traditionally been considered to overlap with somatizing disorders. Conversion
disorder, for instance, has long been thought to represent a form of dissociation.

DSM-5 includes three major sections:
```
- Section I covers historical material and describes the development of DSM-5, as
    well as its organization and use.
- Section II presents the criteria sets for the 19 major diagnostic classes, plus other
    mental disorders. Also included in this section are medication-induced movement
    disorders and other adverse effects of medication, and other conditions that may
    be a focus of clinical attention (V and Z codes).
- Section III includes assessment measures, a cultural formulation, an alternative DSM-
    5 model for personality disorders, and criteria sets for conditions for further study.

The Appendix contains highlights of changes from DSM-IV to DSM-5, a technical
glossary, a glossary of cultural concepts of distress, listings of disorders in both alpha-
betical and numerical (by code) order, and a listing of advisors and field trial partici-
pants involved in the development of DSM-5.
The conditions for further study, in Section III, were proposed for DSM-5 but had
insufficient support from the relevant work group(s) for inclusion as disorders. With
additional study, some of these conditions may be elevated to full disorder status in
the future. They are described in Chapter 22, “Conditions for Further Study.”


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **11**

Several new diagnostic classes and disorders are included in DSM-5. The task
force was aware that the number of new diagnoses had increased at a rapid rate in
prior editions, which fueled speculation by both clinicians and critics about the moti-
vations behind the additions. Because it is easier to add disorders than to remove them,
the DSM-5 Task Force set a high bar for inclusion.

Using DSM-5

DSM-5 is large and complex, but users should not allow these features to intimidate
them. Those new to DSM can begin by examining the lists of classes and diagnoses
and studying the guidelines for its use. First-time users should focus on those areas
most appropriate to the kind of work in which they regularly engage, rather than try-
ing to master the entire manual. People may wish to carry the pocket edition of DSM-
5 ( _Desk Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria From DSM-5_ ), which includes the classifica-
tion and diagnostic criteria only, or use its online counterpart, from which they can
easily download needed criteria sets. Users are encouraged to become familiar with
the criteria for a few common conditions (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophre-
nia) and even to memorize a few that they use frequently. The system is too vast to
commit all of it to memory, however, and clinicians should not feel reluctant to refer
back to the criteria when evaluating a patient’s symptoms and making a diagnosis.
The diagnostic process is a crucial step in any patient evaluation and contributes
to developing a comprehensive formulation and treatment plan. Although a descrip-
tion of the patient evaluation is beyond the scope of this book, as part of the evalua-
tion process, the clinician assesses the patient’s chief complaint and conducts a
detailed inquiry about the current illness, past psychiatric and medical history, and
family and social history. With this information, data from the mental status exami-
nation, and laboratory data in some instances, the clinician can develop a differential
diagnosis and circle in on a provisional diagnosis. It is not unusual for the diagnostic
process to continue as additional information is gathered, and for the clinician to re-
vise his or her initial impression.

Purpose of Diagnosis

Critics may downplay or belittle the significance of a psychiatric diagnosis, but the
diagnostic process is fundamental to the clinician’s role and paves the way to treat-
ment selection. Some concern is understandable because the process sometimes relies
on educated (or subjective) judgments and varying skill levels. Some critics deride a
psychiatric diagnosis as a “label,” yet that characterization trivializes the process and
ignores the important functions that a diagnosis serves.
A psychiatric diagnosis helps to clarify the complex clinical phenomena charac-
teristic of mental illness. The broad array of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral ab-
normalities can manifest in various ways, and diagnostic categories impose order on
this chaos. Diagnoses make mental illnesses easier to understand for professionals in
training, as well as patients, families, and friends of people with psychiatric disor-
ders. They also facilitate communication among clinicians because the DSM-5 catego-


**12** DSM-5 Guidebook

ries serve as a form of professional shorthand. Diagnoses also help predict what lies
ahead for a patient because many psychiatric disorders have a characteristic course
and outcome. The diagnosis alerts the patient’s caregivers to potential problems and
complications that may arise. The diagnosis can also serve as a wake-up call to patients
and can lead them to seek help. Additionally, diagnoses are important to psychiatric re-
searchers, helping them assemble groups of persons with similar symptoms and
problems. This research allows investigators to determine incidence and prevalence,
risk factors, and causes of various diagnoses. Diagnoses are also used as the basis for
treatment selection by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and for devising clinical
practice guidelines.

Mental Disorder Definition

DSM-III was the first DSM edition to include an overall definition of _mental disorder,_
reproduced in the introduction to this book. This definition has been revised for DSM-

5. Although no definition can capture all aspects of all disorders, each disorder iden-
tified in Section II must meet the DSM-5 definition of a mental disorder:

```
A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an
individual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the
psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning.
Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social,
occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved re-
sponse to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental
disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that
are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the de-
viance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above. (p. 20)
```
The diagnosis of a mental disorder is not equivalent to a need for treatment, which
involves complex clinical decisions that consider symptom severity, subjective distress
associated with the symptoms, disability related to the symptoms, and other factors
(e.g., psychiatric symptoms complicating medical conditions). Clinicians may en-
counter individuals whose presentation does not meet full criteria for a mental dis-
order but demonstrates a clear need for treatment or care. Access to care should not be
limited just because a person does not show all symptoms of a diagnosis.
DSM-5 makes clear that this definition was developed for clinical, public health, and
research purposes, and that the inclusion of diagnostic categories such as gambling
disorder and pedophilic disorder does not imply that such conditions meet legal or
other nonmedical definitions of mental disease, mental disorder, mental defect, or
mental disability. Additional information is usually required beyond that contained
in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria to make legal judgments on such issues as criminal
responsibility, eligibility for disability compensation, and competency.

Recording a DSM-5 Diagnosis

Clinicians are encouraged to make multiple diagnoses when necessary to fully de-
scribe the patient’s condition. DSM-III and DSM-IV encouraged the coding of multi-


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **13**

ple diagnoses. The DSM-5 Task Force and work groups were alert to concerns about
multiple diagnoses and reestablished diagnostic hierarchies for several conditions to
lessen this necessity (e.g., in the dissociative disorders chapter, the diagnosis dissocia-
tive identity disorder trumps dissociative amnesia and other diagnoses in the class).
Nonetheless, clinicians need to be alert to all of the patient’s symptoms and respond
accordingly. With regard to the personality disorders, the clinician may wish to refer
to the scales that assess personality trait domains and facets found in Section III of
DSM-5 to more fully describe the patient’s condition.
DSM-5 distinguishes between _principal diagnosis_ and _reason for visit._ The former re-
fers to the condition chiefly responsible for a patient’s hospital stay, whereas the latter
is the condition that prompted an outpatient visit, especially when more than one di-
agnosis is given. The principal diagnosis or reason for visit is indicated by listing it
first, and the remaining disorders are listed in order of focus of attention or treatment.
When the principal diagnosis or reason for visit is a mental disorder due to another
medical condition (e.g., psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm), ICD
coding rules require that the etiological medical condition be listed first. In most
cases, the disorder listed as the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit is followed
by the qualifying phrase “(principal diagnosis)” or “(reason for visit).” For example,
if an outpatient with HIV disease seeks care for symptoms related to a mild neurocog-
nitive disorder related to HIV, “HIV infection” is listed first, followed by “mild neu-
rocognitive disorder due to HIV infection (reason for visit).”
If the clinician does not have sufficient information to allow a firm diagnosis, the
clinician may indicate this uncertainty by recording “(provisional)” following the di-
agnosis. For example, the clinical presentation may support the diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia but the patient is unable to provide adequate history to confirm. Sometimes
it is difficult to tease apart the patient’s principal diagnosis or reason for visit, partic-
ularly when multiple conditions (e.g., both schizophrenia and an alcohol use disor-
der) appear to have occasioned the hospital stay or clinic visit.
Several examples follow of how a clinician might record a diagnostic impression
following an evaluation. In these examples, the ICD-9-CM code is listed first, fol-
lowed in parentheses by the corresponding ICD-10-CM code:

```
Example 1: A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by family members
for bizarre behavior including making threats of harm, muttering obscenities, and talk-
ing to himself. His bizarre behavior appears motivated by paranoid delusions. Family
members report that he drinks nearly daily to intoxication and that he smokes ciga-
rettes nearly nonstop. He has had several prior hospitalizations for similar reasons and
has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. His DSM-5 diagnoses are:
```
```
295.90 (F20.9) Schizophrenia (principal diagnosis)
303.90 (F10.20) Alcohol use disorder, moderate
305.1 (F17.200) Tobacco use disorder, severe
```
```
Example 2: A 65-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his worried spouse. She re-
ports that he has been diagnosed with lung cancer, which his doctors believe has me-
tastasized to his brain. He hears “voices” that tell him not to trust family members. He
has become very suspicious and has threatened family members who he believes are
planning to kill him. There is no psychiatric history. His DSM-5 diagnoses are:
```

**14** DSM-5 Guidebook

```
162.9 (C34.90) Malignant lung neoplasm
293.81 (F06.2) Psychosis due to malignant lung neoplasm (provisional)
```
```
Example 3: A 27-year-old woman presents to the clinic for treatment of intrusive
thoughts about a recent rape and recurrent nightmares. Prior to her recent symptoms,
she reports having experienced overwhelming anxiety in social situations. She also re-
ports a history of deliberate self-harm by cutting, relationship difficulties, and aban-
donment fears. Her DSM-5 diagnoses are:
```
```
309.81 (F43.10) Posttraumatic stress disorder (reason for visit)
300.23 (F40.10) Social anxiety disorder
301.83 (F60.3) Borderline personality disorder
```
Those familiar with prior DSM editions know that the manual is for the diagnosis
of mental disorders and does _not_ include treatment guidelines. Nonetheless, accurate
diagnosis is the first step in providing appropriate treatment for any medical condi-
tion, and mental disorders are no exception. For that reason, DSM-5 is the starting
point for clinicians as they begin by conducting a comprehensive assessment of their
patient. Furthermore, DSM-5 can be helpful in monitoring the effectiveness of treat-
ment because the many dimensional assessments included in the manual can help by
measuring severity and change in response to treatment. Despite the absence of treat-
ment information, DSM-5 provides a wealth of information about diagnostic classes
and disorders that learners from all backgrounds will find useful. These are detailed
in Table 2–2.

DSM-5 Coding

Coding is an essential but underappreciated DSM feature. It is used in utilization re-
view, in gathering statistics for public health purposes, and in making decisions regard-
ing billings and collections. Readers may be surprised that the official coding system in
the United States is not DSM-5 but rather the _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification_ (ICD-9-CM), released by the World Health Organization in

1978. This is the result of a treaty obligation to report health statistics using the ICD sys-
tem. DSM-5 and ICD-9-CM use the same codes, which range from 290 to 319. (DSM
codes form a subset of the ICD-9-CM system, which ranges to 999.) Some DSM-5 disor-
ders are assigned the same ICD code, which is unavoidable because the selection of di-
agnostic codes in DSM-5 is limited to those already included in ICD-9-CM. It was
expected that DSM-5 and its new counterpart, ICD-10-CM, would become available at
the same time (May 2013), so that both would employ the same new codes. However,
because implementation of ICD-10-CM is delayed to October 2014, DSM-5 uses ICD-9-
CM codes. Nonetheless, ICD-10-CM codes are shown parenthetically in DSM-5, but
they should not be used until the official implementation occurs.
    The ICD-9-CM code is a three- to five-digit number in front of the name of a DSM-
5 disorder; the code precedes the name of the disorder in the classification and accom-
panies the criteria set for each disorder. For some diagnoses, such as intellectual dis-
ability (intellectual developmental disorder)—formerly called _mental retardation_ —the
appropriate code depends on further specification and is listed _following_ the criteria
for the disorder. The names of some disorders are followed by alternative terms in
parentheses—for example, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)—which in most
cases are older terms for the disorder.
    For each DSM disorder, an ICD-9-CM code is selected that most closely matches
the symptoms of the disorder. For example, the ICD-9-CM code for depressive neu-
rosis is assigned to DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder because that ICD-9-CM con-
cept comes closest to matching the DSM-5 concept. If a category is not reflected in
ICD-9-CM, the convention is to assign an “other” code. These are available through-
out ICD-9-CM to accommodate the addition of new disorders. For example, with bi-
polar II disorder, which was new to DSM-IV, the code 296.89 was selected, which
corresponds to “other bipolar disorder” in ICD-9-CM. For DSM-5 the same general
rule applies to new diagnoses: a code is selected by 1) examining the existing system
and finding a category that best corresponds to the condition in question or 2) assign-
ing an “other” code. Even though the newly assigned DSM code may not be a precise
conceptual match for the existing ICD-9-CM entity, from a practical perspective it
does not matter because insurance companies usually accept and pay for most ICD-
9-CM codes unless the code is specifically excluded by the insurer.
    Some disorders have a three-digit code, although most have four or five digits.
Certain diagnostic codes have a blank in place of a digit(s). In these cases, the user
must insert a specific digit in place of the blank to indicate either a subtype or a level
of severity. Subtypes and specifiers are provided for increased specificity. _Subtypes_ de-
fine mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive subgroupings within a diagnosis and
are indicated by the instruction “specify whether” in the criteria set. For example, de-


**16** DSM-5 Guidebook

lusional disorder is subtyped based on the content of the delusions, with seven sub-
types provided (e.g., erotomanic type).
In contrast, _specifiers_ are not intended to be mutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive
and are indicated with the instruction “specify” or “specify if” in the criteria set (e.g.,
for obsessive-compulsive disorder, the clinician is asked to specify if tic related). Spec-
ifiers provide an opportunity to define a more homogeneous subgrouping of individ-
uals with the disorder who share certain features (e.g., major depressive disorder with
melancholic features). Although a fifth digit is sometimes assigned to code a subtype
or specifier, a majority of subtypes and most specifiers in DSM-5 _cannot_ be coded in the
ICD-9-CM system and are indicated only by including the subtype or specifier after
the name of the disorder (e.g., social anxiety disorder, performance only).

Indicating Diagnostic Certainty

DSM-5 allows various ways for clinicians to specify level of diagnostic certainty, as
shown in the following examples:

```
V/Z codes: Information is insufficient to know whether a presenting problem is at-
tributable to a mental disorder (e.g., academic problem, partner-relational problem).
300.9 (F99) Unspecified mental disorder: Symptoms of a mental disorder are pres-
ent, but sufficient information is unavailable to make a more specific diagnosis.
298.9 (F29) Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder: The pa-
tient is having a psychotic episode, but further diagnostic specification is not possible.
Specific diagnosis (provisional): Enough information is available to make a “work-
ing” diagnosis, but the clinician wishes to indicate a significant level of diagnostic
uncertainty by recording “(provisional)” following the diagnosis.
Specific diagnosis: The clinician has sufficient information to be confident of the
diagnosis.
```
“Other Specified” and

“Unspecified” Categories

In DSM-5, “other specified” and “unspecified” categories generally cover the same
range of conditions as the “not otherwise specified” sections in DSM-IV. The “other
specified” disorder category allows clinicians to communicate the specific reason that
the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific category, followed by the
specific reason. For example, with an individual having one or more hypomanic epi-
sodes yet whose symptoms have never met full criteria for a major depressive or manic
episode, a clinician could record “other specified bipolar and related disorder, with hy-
pomanic episode without prior major depressive episode.” If the clinician chooses not
to specify the reason the criteria are not met for a specific disorder, then the category
“unspecified bipolar and related disorder” is used. The unspecified category is also
used when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Demise of the Multiaxial System

The multiaxial diagnostic system, a familiar part of the diagnostic process, has been
discontinued. Opinions about the value of the multiaxial system have sharply di-
vided psychiatrists over the past three decades, many of whom considered it unhelp-
ful and burdensome. Many simply ignored the system. The multiaxial diagnostic system
was first included in DSM-III and involved the creation of five _axes,_ each of which as-
sessed a different domain of information, as reviewed in the Introduction to this book.
The purpose of the multiaxial system, as pointed out in DSM-III (American Psychiat-
ric Association 1980), was to ensure that “every case [was] assessed on each of several
‘axes,’ each of which refers to a different class of information” (p. 23). The multiaxial
scheme continued mostly unchanged up through DSM-IV-TR.
One goal in developing the multiaxial diagnostic system was to ensure that per-
sonality disorders and mental retardation (now intellectual disability [intellectual de-
velopmental disorder]) were appropriately recognized and were not overlooked by
clinicians whose attention was focused on the more florid disorders that were the pre-
senting problems. Also, medical illnesses were known to be highly comorbid with
psychiatric disorders and were often missed or ignored. The system also was meant
to ensure that clinicians paid attention to psychosocial factors that may have played a
role in the initiation or exacerbation of the psychiatric disorder. Axis V provided a way
to rate a patient’s global functioning, something often not captured in a diagnosis.
From the outset, critics disdained the artificial separation of Axis I and Axis II dis-
orders, pointing to the lack of a fundamental distinction among these disorders, and
decrying the fact that Axis II only further marginalized personality disorders and
mental retardation. Third-party payers took advantage of this situation and often de-
clined payment if Axis II disorders were coded as the primary problem. Furthermore,
in many situations, there was no clear distinction between Axis I and Axis II (e.g.,
Axis I social anxiety disorder and Axis II avoidant personality disorder). Axis III was
never used consistently, and often the distinction between Axis I and Axis III disor-
ders was confusing or artificial. Axes IV and V were criticized as arbitrary and unre-
liable. Despite the fact that the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale was
derived from the widely used Global Assessment Scale (Endicott et al. 1976), there
was little reason to believe the scale was used reliably by clinicians unfamiliar with
rating scales. Further, GAF Scale scores were used arbitrarily by third-party payers to
deny care when the score was either too high (meaning the patient was functioning
too well to need treatment) or too low (meaning the patient was too ill to benefit from
treatment). Finally, no other diagnostic system uses a multiaxial system, which placed
DSM in conflict with the rest of medicine.
These concerns led the DSM-5 Task Force to end the multiaxial system. Clinicians
no longer need to artificially separate conditions formerly listed on Axes I through III.
Instead of Axis IV, clinicians can specify one or more of the V/Z code conditions
(“Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”). In place of Axis V,
clinicians can use the self-administered World Health Organization Disability Assess-
ment Schedule 2.0, contained in Section III and briefly described in Chapter 20, “As-
sessment Measures,” later in this book.

Overview of Changes to

Each Diagnostic Category

This section provides an overview of the major changes made in each diagnostic cat-
egory. They are described in more detail in Chapters 3–19 of this book.

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders is a reformulation of the DSM-IV chapter “Disorders
Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.” There have been
several major changes. First, the **mental retardation** diagnosis has been replaced by
**intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).** There is no longer a re-
liance on IQ as the determinant for inclusion in the category. Instead, subtypes are
used to classify severity of the individual’s disorder as mild, moderate, severe, or pro-
found, while adaptive functioning is given greater emphasis. The arbitrary reliance
on IQ was considered limiting because it does not take into account the different do-
mains of functioning (social, conceptual/intellectual, practical) that allow a more nu-
anced view of the person with an intellectual deficit.
Another major change was the creation of an omnibus category, **autism spectrum
disorder,** for pervasive developmental disorders. Consolidated into this category are
the following DSM-IV diagnoses: **autistic disorder, Rett’s disorder, childhood disin-
tegrative disorder, Asperger’s disorder,** and **pervasive developmental disorder not
otherwise specified.** The change was prompted by research showing that the disor-
ders were not as discrete and independent as once thought, and that clinicians had
difficulty distinguishing them. All persons formerly diagnosed with each of these dis-
orders should have their presentation covered by the new category, and its subtleties
should be adequately addressed by the severity specifiers.
With **attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,** examples have been added to the
criterion items to facilitate application across the life span, and the age at onset of in-
attentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms description has been changed from be-
fore age 7 years to before age 12 years. Subtypes have been replaced with presentation
specifiers, and the comorbid diagnosis with autism spectrum disorder is now al-
lowed.
The **communication disorders** are newly named from DSM-IV phonological dis-
order and stuttering, while **specific learning disorder** combines DSM-IV diagnoses
of reading disorder, mathematics disorder, disorder of written expression, and learn-
ing disorder not otherwise specified.
Other changes to the class include moving **conduct disorder** to a new chapter,
“Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders.” **Elimination disorders** ( **en-
uresis** and **encopresis** ) now have their own chapter. The **feeding disorders** ( **pica, ru-
mination disorder,** and **avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder** [replacing and
extending feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood]) have been combined with
the eating disorders for a more comprehensive chapter titled “Feeding and Eating
Disorders.” **Separation anxiety disorder** and **selective mutism** have been moved to
the chapter “Anxiety Disorders,” while **reactive attachment disorder** has been moved


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **19**

to the chapter “Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders” because of its relationship
with parental neglect.

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

Disorders are now generally arranged along a gradient from least to most severe.
**Schizotypal personality disorder** has been listed in this chapter because it is consid-
ered part of the schizophrenia spectrum, although the criteria and discussion remain
in the chapter on personality disorders. The criteria for **delusional disorder** are mostly
unchanged, but the adjective _nonbizarre_ has been removed (Criterion A), and the so-
matic subtype has been edited to ensure that those who are delusional regarding a
“physical defect” are more appropriately diagnosed with **body dysmorphic disorder**
(moved to the chapter “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders”). **Shared psy-
chotic disorder** has been dropped because the diagnosis was infrequently used and
presentations that qualified for the diagnosis generally met criteria for another psy-
chotic disorder. With **schizophrenia,** the special treatment given bizarre delusions
and special types of hallucinations has been eliminated. Further, schizophrenia sub-
types have been discontinued. Although these subtypes had a lengthy history, clinical
utility and predictive validity were poor. **Schizoaffective disorder** has been changed
to provide more guidance to clinicians regarding the total duration of mood symp-
toms. Instead of requiring that they last a “substantial portion of the total duration of
the active and residual periods of the illness” (as in DSM-IV), DSM-5 requires that
mood symptoms be present for the “majority of the total duration of the active and
residual portions of the illness.” Criteria for **catatonia** are described, and the disorder
may be diagnosed with a specifier (for depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders,
including schizophrenia), in the context of a known medical illness, or as an unspec-
ified diagnosis.

Bipolar and Related Disorders

The mood disorders of DSM-IV have been divided into **bipolar and related disorders**
and **depressive disorders,** each with its own chapter. Greater emphasis has been given
to changes in activity and energy in the context of mania/hypomania, with the goal of
improving the likelihood of early identification. Criteria for **bipolar I disorder, most
recent episode mixed,** have been dropped, and instead the specifier “with mixed fea-
tures” has been added that can be applied to episodes of mania/hypomania when de-
pressive features are present and to episodes of depression in the context of both **major
depressive disorder** and **bipolar disorder** lifetime diagnoses when features of hypo-
mania are present. A “with anxious distress” specifier has also been delineated.

Depressive Disorders

**Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder** and **premenstrual dysphoric disorder** are
new diagnoses. The former was added to address concerns about the potential overdi-
agnosis and overtreatment of bipolar disorder in children, whereas the latter was
moved from DSM-IV Appendix B, “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study,”


**20** DSM-5 Guidebook

and given full disorder status. **Persistent depressive disorder** is new and replaces both
DSM-IV dysthymia and chronic major depressive disorder. The coexistence within a
major depressive episode of at least three manic symptoms insufficient to satisfy criteria
for manic episode is now acknowledged by the specifier “with mixed features.”
The exclusion applied to depressive symptoms lasting less than 2 months follow-
ing the death of a loved one in DSM-IV (i.e., the so-called bereavement exclusion) has
been omitted, and bereavement is now acknowledged as a severe psychosocial
stressor that can precipitate a major depressive episode. The authors of DSM-5 felt
that the evidence did not support the separation of loss of a loved one from other
stressors in terms of its likelihood of precipitating a major depressive episode.

Anxiety Disorders

**Obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder,** and **acute stress
disorder** have been moved from the “Anxiety Disorders” chapter to other chapters.
**Separation anxiety disorder** and **selective mutism** have been moved to “Anxiety Dis-
orders” from “Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adoles-
cence.” For **specific phobia** and **social anxiety disorder (social phobia)** diagnoses,
changes include deletion of the requirement that individuals over age 18 years recog-
nize their anxiety as excessive or unreasonable. Instead, the anxiety must be out of
proportion to the actual danger or threat, after sociocultural contextual factors are
taken into account. The 6-month duration, which was limited to individuals younger
than 18 years, has been extended to all ages. This change is expected to minimize the
overdiagnosis of transient fears. **Panic disorder** and **agoraphobia** have been un-
linked; each is now its own diagnosis, and their co-occurrence is now coded as two
diagnoses. **Panic attacks** can now be used as a specifier for any mental disorder and
some medical conditions. The **specific phobia** types are now listed as specifiers. With
**social anxiety disorder,** the “generalized” specifier has been dropped and replaced
with a “performance only” specifier. Finally, for **separation anxiety disorder,** the
wording has been changed to more adequately represent the expression of separation
anxiety symptoms in adulthood.

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

This new chapter brings together disorders related to **obsessive-compulsive disor-
der.** Other disorders include **body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, tricho-
tillomania (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, substance/
medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,** and **obsessive-
compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition. Body dysmor-
phic disorder** was moved from the somatoform disorders class. **Hoarding** was listed
as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder in DSM-IV (Criterion 5),
but research evidence shows it to be a distinct condition. **Trichotillomania (hair-pull-
ing disorder)** was moved from the DSM-IV chapter “Impulse-Control Disorders Not
Elsewhere Classified,” and **excoriation (skin-picking) disorder** is new. An insight
specifier for **obsessive-compulsive disorder** allows clinicians to be more precise
about the person’s level of insight: good or fair, poor, and absent insight/delusional


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **21**

beliefs. Analogous specifiers have been included for **body dysmorphic disorder** and
**hoarding disorder.** A tic-related specifier has been added for **obsessive-compulsive
disorder** because the presence of a comorbid tic may have important clinical implica-
tions. A muscle dysmorphia specifier reflects the importance of making this distinc-
tion in individuals with **body dysmorphic disorder.**

Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders

This chapter brings together disorders that result from exposure to trauma or to a
stressor and includes **reactive attachment disorder, disinhibited social engagement
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder,** and **adjustment disor-
ders.** With **posttraumatic stress disorder,** the stressor criterion (Criterion A) is now
more explicit with regard to events that qualify as “traumatic” experiences. Also,
DSM-IV Criterion A2 (subjective reaction) has been eliminated. Whereas there were
three major symptom clusters in DSM-IV—reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, and
arousal—there are now four because the avoidance/numbing cluster has been di-
vided into two clusters: persistent avoidance and persistent negative alterations in
cognitions and mood. This latter category, which retains most of the DSM-IV numbing
symptoms, also includes new or reconceptualized symptoms such as persistent emo-
tional states. The final cluster—marked alterations in arousal and reactivity—retains
most of the DSM-IV arousal symptoms. It also includes irritable behavior and angry
outbursts, and reckless or self-destructive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder is
now developmentally sensitive in that diagnostic thresholds have been lowered for
children and adolescents. Furthermore, separate criteria have been added for children
age 6 years or younger with this disorder. Dissociative symptoms are no longer re-
quired (as in DSM-IV) for the diagnosis of **acute stress disorder. Adjustment disor-
ders** now require distress _and/or_ impairment for the diagnosis, rather than either
distress _or_ impairment.

Dissociative Disorders

Derealization is included in the name and symptom structure of what previously was
called **depersonalization disorder** (now **depersonalization/derealization disorder** ).
**Dissociative fugue** has become a specifier of **dissociative amnesia** rather than a sep-
arate diagnosis. The criteria for **dissociative identity disorder** have been changed to
indicate that symptoms of disruption of identity may be reported as well as observed,
and that gaps in the recall of events may occur for everyday and not just traumatic
events. Also, experiences of pathological possession in some cultures have been in-
cluded as part of the description of identity disruption.

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

This chapter has been reorganized and renamed. Because of the considerable overlap
among DSM-IV somatoform disorders, as well as a lack of clarity about their bound-
aries, the new diagnosis **somatic symptom disorder** replaces **somatization disorder,
hypochondriasis, pain disorder,** and **undifferentiated somatoform disorder.** Most


**22** DSM-5 Guidebook

persons previously diagnosed with somatization disorder will now receive the diag-
nosis **somatic symptom disorder,** but only if they have excessive thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors in addition to their somatic symptoms. People with high health anxiety
but no somatic symptoms now receive a DSM-5 diagnosis of **illness anxiety disorder,**
which is new. **Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions** is a new
mental disorder in DSM-5, having formerly been listed in the DSM-IV chapter “Other
Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention.” This condition and **factitious
disorder** are placed with the somatic symptom and related disorders because somatic
symptoms are predominant in each. Criteria for **conversion disorder (functional neu-
rological symptom disorder)** have been changed to emphasize the essential impor-
tance of the neurological examination and in recognition that relevant psychological
factors may not be demonstrable at the time of diagnosis. **Body dysmorphic disorder**
was moved to the chapter “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.”

Feeding and Eating Disorders

**Pica** and **rumination disorder** have been moved from the DSM-IV chapter “Disor-
ders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” because these
two conditions involve disturbed feeding behaviors. Feeding disorder of infancy or
early childhood has been renamed **avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder,** and the
criteria have been expanded to allow the diagnosis to be used in adults who restrict
their food intake but whose presentation does not meet criteria for one of the eating
disorders. The criteria for **anorexia nervosa** are conceptually unchanged except that
the requirement for amenorrhea has been eliminated. The wording of Criterion A has
been clarified, and guidance regarding how to judge whether an individual is at or
below a significantly low weight is provided in the text. Criterion B has been ex-
panded to include not only expressed intense fear of weight gain or of becoming fat,
but also persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain. The only change for **bu-
limia nervosa** is a reduction of the required minimum average frequency of binge eat-
ing and of inappropriate compensatory behavior from twice a week to once weekly.
**Binge-eating disorder** is a new diagnosis; it was included in Appendix B of DSM-IV.
The criteria have been changed such that the minimum average frequency of binge
eating required is once weekly over the past 3 months, identical to the frequency cri-
terion for bulimia nervosa.

Elimination Disorders

The elimination disorders **encopresis** and **enuresis** are conditions most often first di-
agnosed in childhood. They were previously included in the chapter “Disorders Usu-
ally First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence,” but they now have their
own chapter.

Sleep-Wake Disorders

DSM-5 has removed **sleep disorder related to another medical disorder** and **sleep
disorder related to a general medical condition,** and instead greater specification of


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **23**

coexisting conditions is provided for each sleep-wake disorder. The diagnosis pri-
mary insomnia has been renamed **insomnia disorder** to avoid the differentiation be-
tween primary and secondary insomnia. DSM-5 also distinguishes **narcolepsy** from
other forms of hypersomnolence ( **hypersomnolence disorder** ). Throughout the class,
pediatric and developmental criteria and text have been integrated where existing sci-
ence and considerations of clinical utility support such integration. **Breathing-related
sleep disorders** are divided into three relatively distinct disorders: **obstructive sleep
apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea,** and **sleep-related hypoventilation.** The types
of **circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders** are expanded to include **advanced sleep
phase type** and **irregular sleep-wake type,** whereas **jet lag type** has been removed.
**Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder** and **restless legs syndrome** are now
independent disorders.

Sexual Dysfunctions

Gender-specific sexual dysfunctions have been added, and women’s sexual desire
and arousal disorders have been combined in one disorder, **female sexual interest/
arousal disorder.** All of the sexual dysfunctions (except **substance/medication-
induced sexual dysfunction, other specified sexual dysfunction,** and **unspecified
sexual dysfunction** ), now require a minimum duration of approximately 6 months
and more precise severity criteria. This will help distinguish transient sexual difficul-
ties from more persistent sexual dysfunction. Vaginismus and dyspareunia have been
merged into **genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder,** because the two disorders were
difficult to distinguish. **Sexual aversion disorder** was rarely used and has been deleted.
There are now only two subtypes for sexual dysfunctions: **lifelong** versus **acquired** ,
and, for most of the dysfunctions, **generalized** versus **situational**.

Gender Dysphoria

**Gender dysphoria** is a new diagnostic class, having been moved from the DSM-IV
chapter “Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders.” The new name (from DSM-IV gender
identity disorder) reflects a change by emphasizing the phenomenon of gender incon-
gruence rather than cross-gender identification. For gender dysphoria in adolescents
and adults, a more detailed and specific set of symptoms has been added. The previous
Criterion A (cross-gender identification) and Criterion B (aversion toward one’s gen-
der) are merged because there was no supporting evidence to separate the two. The
wording “the other sex” has been replaced by “the other gender.” _Gender_ instead of _sex_
is used throughout because the concept _sex_ is inadequate when referring to people
with a disorder of sex development. In the child criteria, “strong desire to be of the
other gender” replaces the previous “repeatedly stated desire to be. .. the other sex,” to
capture the situation of some children who, in a coercive environment, may not verbal-
ize the desire to be of another gender. For **gender dysphoria in children,** Criterion A1
(“a strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that one is the other gender”)
is now necessary (but not sufficient), which makes the diagnosis more restrictive and
conservative. Subtyping on the basis of sexual orientation has been removed because
the distinction was no longer felt to be clinically useful. A posttransition specifier has


**24** DSM-5 Guidebook

been added to identify individuals who have undergone at least one cross-sex medical
procedure or treatment regimen to support the new gender assignment.

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

This chapter brings together disorders characterized by problems with the self-regu-
lation of emotions and behaviors and largely replaces the DSM-IV chapter “Impulse-
Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified.” The chapter includes **oppositional de-
fiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial person-
ality disorder** (which is described in the chapter on personality disorders),
**pyromania,** and **kleptomania.** DSM-5 has removed the exclusionary criterion of
DSM-IV that allowed for the diagnosis of **oppositional defiant disorder** only if the
criteria for **conduct disorder** were not met. The criteria for **conduct disorder** include
a descriptive features specifier for individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria but
who also present with limited prosocial emotions. The primary change in **intermit-
tent explosive disorder** is the type of aggressive outbursts that should be considered:
DSM-IV required physical aggression, whereas in DSM-5 verbal aggression or non-
destructive/noninjurious physical aggression also meets the criterion. Furthermore,
a minimum age of 6 years (or equivalent developmental level) is now required.

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

This chapter has been expanded to include **gambling disorder.** The inclusion of this
disorder reflects increasing evidence that some behaviors, such as gambling, activate
the same reward system as do substances and have effects similar to those of drugs
of abuse. _Importantly, the distinction is no longer made between abuse and dependence._
These two former diagnoses are merged into a single **substance use disorder** because
the distinction between abuse and dependence was often arbitrary, of limited utility,
and frequently confusing. Within substance use disorders, the DSM-IV recurrent sub-
stance-related legal problems criterion has been deleted, and a new criterion—craving,
or a strong desire or urge to use a substance—has been added. Severity of the disorder
is specified on the basis of the number of symptoms present. **Caffeine withdrawal**
and **cannabis withdrawal** are new, the former having been included in DSM-IV Ap-
pendix B, “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study.”

Neurocognitive Disorders

The DSM-IV diagnoses **dementia** and **amnestic disorder** are subsumed under the
new diagnosis **major neurocognitive disorder,** although the word _dementia_ is not pre-
cluded for use in the subtypes where it is standard. Notably, DSM-5 recognizes a less
severe level of cognitive impairment, **mild neurocognitive disorder,** which is a new
disorder that permits the diagnosis of less disabling syndromes that may nonetheless
be the focus of concern and treatment. Diagnostic criteria are provided for both major
and mild neurocognitive disorders, and these are followed by diagnostic criteria for
the different etiological subtypes (e.g., major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to
Alzheimer’s disease).


**_Use of DSM-5 and Major Changes From DSM-IV_** **25**

Personality Disorders

The personality disorders class is no longer coded on Axis II since the multiaxial sys-
tem has been discontinued. The criteria in Section II have not changed from those in
DSM-IV. An alternative approach to the diagnosis of personality disorders was devel-
oped for DSM-5, and subsequently designated for further study, and can be found in
Section III of the manual (see Chapter 21, “Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality
Disorders”). Other changes to the diagnostic class include moving **personality
change due to another medical condition** from the DSM-IV chapter “Delirium, De-
mentia, Amnestic, and Other Cognitive Disorders.”

Paraphilic Disorders

Paraphilic disorders were previously placed in the DSM-IV chapter “Sexual and Gender
Identity Disorders.” In DSM-5, course specifiers “in a controlled environment” and “in
remission” have been added to the diagnostic criteria sets for all **paraphilic disorders**
(except pedophilic disorder). The specifiers are added to indicate important changes in
an individual’s status. In DSM-5, paraphilias are not ipso facto mental disorders: “A
_paraphilic disorder_ is a paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the
individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of
harm, to others. A paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a
paraphilic disorder, and a paraphilia by itself does not necessarily justify or require clin-
ical intervention” (American Psychiatric Association 2013, pp. 685–686).

Other Conditions

DSM-5 includes additional categories for important conditions and problems that are not
considered mental disorders. These include **medication-induced movement disorders
and other adverse effects of medication** (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, antidepressant dis-
continuation syndrome) and **other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention**
(V/Z code diagnoses). The latter have the potential to cause great distress to patients or
their family members. Although common, the V/Z code diagnoses are underutilized.

Conditions for Further Study

Placing “Conditions for Further Study” in Section III of DSM-5 ensures that interested
investigators are discussing and researching the same condition for possible inclusion
in future DSM editions. Proposed criteria sets for conditions for further study were
first included in DSM-III-R as a way to promote the collection of new data that could
be used to validate new disorders. Few proposed conditions have achieved full dis-
order status, but this method allows the scientific process to determine the outcome.
Some of the proposed conditions in DSM-5 are **attenuated psychosis syndrome, per-
sistent complex bereavement disorder,** and **Internet gaming disorder.**

“Another Medical Condition”

Careful readers of DSM-5 will note that the wording has been changed regarding the uni-
versal exclusion of medical conditions in the differential diagnostic process. In DSM-IV,


**26** DSM-5 Guidebook

the wording used was “general medical condition.” In DSM-5, the wording is “another
medical condition.” In both cases, before a diagnosis can be made, a medical condition
must be excluded as a cause of the symptoms. The change of wording in DSM-5 helps to
emphasize that psychiatric disorders are _medical_ and that as part of the differential di-
agnostic process, clinicians need to exclude other medical conditions as the cause.
This should help learners understand that mental disorders have physical causes.

KEY POINTS

- DSM-5 has three sections: I, which presents historical material and describes
    the manual’s organization and use; II, which presents the criteria sets for the 19
    major diagnostic classes, plus other mental disorders, medication-induced
    movement disorders and other adverse effects of medication, and other condi-
    tions that may be a focus of clinical attention (V/Z codes); and III, which pro-
    vides assessment measures, a cultural formulation, an alternative DSM-5
    model for personality disorders, and conditions for further study.
- The overall organization (metastructure) has changed to better reflect the relat-
    edness of various classes. Chapters are arranged in a developmental life span
    fashion, starting with neurodevelopmental disorders and progressing through
    diagnostic areas more commonly diagnosed in adulthood.
- The multiaxial diagnostic scheme has been discontinued.
- The following diagnostic classes have been added in response to clinical need
    and scientific advances:
    - Trauma- and stressor-related disorders
    - Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
    - Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders
- Several classes have been substantially revised, renamed, or reorganized:
    - Neurodevelopmental disorders
    - Somatic symptom and related disorders
    - Substance-related and addictive disorders
    - Neurocognitive disorders
- Several classes have been divided or consolidated:
    - Mood disorders were separated into two chapters: “Bipolar and Related Dis-
       orders” and “Depressive Disorders.”
    - Sexual and gender identity disorders were separated into three chapters:
       “Sexual Dysfunctions,” “Gender Dysphoria,” and “Paraphilic Disorders.”
    - Elimination disorders have been removed from the DSM-IV chapter “Disor-
       ders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” and
       now have their own chapter.
    - Feeding disorders have been removed from the DSM-IV chapter “Disorders
       Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” and are
       combined with the eating disorders.
